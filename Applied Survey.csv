Latin America
What can Johnson & Johnson do to improve the recruitment process?
_
"You should tell the applicant if is not selected because I still don't receive any response, call for an interview or feedback. "
You should have a spanish version.
"You should certainly not keep a candidate waiting for the reply. If you are not find the candidate suitable for the job, he should be informed straight away."
You should be faster between the processes
You need to let people know about the job posting status. I got this survey email but no email related to the application.
"You might suggest that you have a good talent search page in several languages, you may lose several opportunities to recruit people just because you do not know another language other than the native language."
You just need give me a chance!
You have a good system for recruitment
You dont know that you are in only when you got a mail explaining that the process is finished.
"You could send this survey right after the application was send, so all the experice is fresh. But everything else was pretty good."
You could provide Talent Acquisition person`s contact and hiring manager`s contact.
"You could keep in touch whit the candidates for future positions 

I hope to get the job Thank you "
"You could improve recruitment making online tests, and some interview online too, i think this could make the process easier and faster."
You could do an easier and more intuitive interface of you jnj site
You could contract me.
You could contact on the video or telephone whit the intervieews
"You could announce if the job position has an internal strong candidate identified in the process.

Could be important to show statistics to know how many candidates there are and what is the level of accuracy of my application."
You can send mail's informing the status of the process 
You can send a message to the applicants and tell them how the recruitment process for the post applied is going.
You can keep using these surveys to know what needs have the people who applies for work with the enterprise.
You can include an equivalence table of academic degrees for out of the United States applicants. I found some difficulty in grading my academic accomplishments since my education is based in Mexico.
You can implement a online system for review the status of application.
You can give feedback to your candidates.
You can give better feedback regarding the applications. I was never contacted by anyone from J&J and have applied several times.
You can facilitate the acces for the jobs offers.
"You can  sent a email to the candidates when the process is finish. Maybe give some feed back or information  from the candidates.

Regards

Henry Ballen"
"You are to be congratulated with the way of publicizing the vacancy. I believe that Linkedin is the most fair and effective way to search for talent today. I would very much like to have my profile and CV evaluated by a Talent Acquisition, to be able to have an interview opportunity."
"You are set up an pattern format, which in addition to include a resume and cover letter, requires of filling  information contained into those documents mentioned, then it seems redundant, or ask for the resume or ask to fill a catalog of descriptions."
you are doing just great! you made me feel interested and as an important part of the process. 
"Yes, contact us by cell fone"
yes
"Write or calling the person who is in the process, because I didn't know nothing about this. Thank you "
Would have dead line time to inform about the feedback process. 
"Would be great to get back some of the human contact probably with HHRR or the area / department posting the job; usually a CV or platform is not enough to share several aspects from both the person applying to the job (profile, etc.) and the company (culture, etc.)."
Work on the speed of the process
Work in develop a way to feedback the candidates about the process status.
"Without suggestions, the recruitment process is modern and facilitates the candidate's participation."
"With Cordis Webster in 1998 was good and with Ethicon Inc in 2015 was good too, I belive the values in this área make match with the credo, so no complaints by me.

I would like saher my experience, visión to improve, knowledges and my service attitud with J&J again.

Thank you,
LGG"
Will be great if have another languages to do the application. Wasn't a problem for me but I believe that the company could loss good employies because of the english language. 
Will  establish a schedule from beginning to finish the hire process 
"Whenever possible, a fast feedback regarding the candidate's status for the applied position."
"when we not be considered to application has a return why we not be considered, how role we need improve"
"When the post was announced internally by email it was not synchronized with the web site, so when I when to mycarreer to apply for the position is was not available and this was confusing.

Also It could help to share a contact point (the recruiter info) for the internal J&J candidates to share possible questions about the job description or the process. "
"When jobs are available on job board websites such as linkedin and indeed, sometimes the application period already expired and it is directed to an error page, making the applicant little bit confused. Perhaps it would redirect to a page with a message that the application period already expired."
"When I applied for a job in Jonhson & Jonhson, i dedicate time for this task, and for me is very important to have your feedback so I can underdstand if I have the chance to participe in the selection process or not, and their respective reasons"
"When apply to job positions, sometimes a letter of rejection is sent inmediately as it happens with this application. Most of the times, nothing happens, just do not hear from JnJ about the process. Make sure candidates receive the righ information on time."
"Well, the tool is good but I applied this job 3 weeks ago and I didn´t have feedback till now."
"Well I think that just posting the vacancy in several portals so that more professionals have the opportunity to apply is very motivating, could advance some tests according to the position to simplify the process a little"
"Well ,I can not answer this question because this is the first stage after apply , but I hope will be a quick process and  you give  me the opportunity to continue in it."
Webnars with current prefessionals talking about their jobs and roles and how they contribute to the company
Web site often present error and the candidate has to restart the application process from the begin. 
We can send our Resume from LinkedIn  
We always welcome a phone call or an email indicating if you were not selected or how the process is going
Was very transparence and with easy communication.
Waiting a contact phone or email in order to know the status. 
Vou given à Feedback to the candidates
"Visar com mais ênfase pessoas que já passaram dos 40 anos e também priorizar locais de trabalho para pessoas com deficiências ex: cadeirantes, muletas etc.Tenho certeza que pessoas como eu que se enquadra nas duas questões somos eficientes para mostramos o nosso profissional a qualquer empresa que possa nos dar a oportunidade.

Grata, por poder expressar o que penso.

"Via LinkedIn, the process is flawless. "
Very professionally 
"Very hard application process, i did not get any feedback from J&J-"
"Very good, timely and respectful "
Verify also job fit potential instead of just work experience.
"Vejo que a empresa como grandes corporações já possui excelência no que tange a recrutamento,mas gostaria de acrescentar um ponto,poderia haver um incentivo de recrutamento para pessoas profissionais seniores que na maioria das vezes não são pessoas de pouca idade este perfil de profissional geralmente passa dos 40 anos."
Utilizes an user interface that supports more the application process.
Utilizar o banco de dados na Internet de forma ativa não só para se adequar ao compliece da empresa.
Utilizar cada vez mais os recursos de autocompletar as informações quando escolhermos a opção de login por meio do Linkedin.
Uses only linkedin profile. 
Use state of the art technology mixed in an intelligent and feasible manner to the human factor...
Use social networks like Linkedin to publish the vacancy
Use diferent web pages to reach more people and get in contact with some universities.
Upto now it has been a simpler Internet process than some other big companies sites.
Updating continuosly its candidates data base and uses LinkedIn as recruiter to give people more easily access to J&J job opportunities. 
Updating 
Update the process of your application
"Up until know, I believe that the process efficient & satisfactory"
"Up to this point the JnJ platform and process are friendly, would not recommend any improvement so far."
"Untill now, I guess the process is quite right, with no necessity of improvement."
"Until this phase of the recruitment process, I did not could realize any improvements that can be done because the time of response of the application was good, the email about the English test was very clear and the English test was easy to access through the Survey Monkey."
"Until the moment the selection process is complete, with return to the candidate. I'm going to stay and I'm really interested in being part of this company."
"Until now, considering that I have just one contact with J&J, I think that everything is going well and alligned with the positive image that I have about the company. I'm very grateful to be contacted and I hope that it means just a begining of a very succeed history. Best regards, Valter Loscher.  "
Until now the recruitment process seems to be good. I have nothing to complain.
"Until now the process its perfect, but if the time between the application and receiving this mail could be shorter will be better. 
Thanks"
Until now it has been great thank you so much
"until now i didn't received an anwser, maybe if there was a way to let us know if we are still in process of recuitment or not, would help"
"Unfortunatly, I haven't been contact to participate of recruitment process. Unique communication was this email asking for a feedback."
"Unfortunately, this has been happening quite often, companies have been receiving a high number of resumes and are not able to view all applications, or manage to review the application but do not answer the applicants who look forward to receiving a feedback (positive or negative).
Allan Dias"
"Unfortunately, I cannot argue about recruitment process. I´ve applied to the position, at J&J website, but didn´t receive feedback regarding next steps."
"Unfortunately I did not get to do an interview, so I can not evaluate the process as a whole."
"Unfortunately  I got a bad experience, on may 8th I was contacted via e-mail from HR to got interviewed on May 11th at 11 but never send me a physical address, that day I reply the email and confirmed some background information requested but never got an answer ,  I do some research over the Internet and call HR on May 10th but none work that day at J&J , on  May 11th call early and Karla Obviedo told me that the Process was On hold. 
I was very excited about the process and to have the chance to be part of the J&J recruitment process to end like this!, in the future please be sure about the job postings.
Sincerely,
Sergio Vazquez"
Understand if the 18 months always is a requisite since in some cases that I have identified people inside of the company moves from one position to another in less than 1 year. I would like to know if this condition always happen or what's the trigger to reach positions below 18 months.
"una gran compañía felicidades, el proceso de selección para la vacante ha sido lento."
Uma melhor aplicação do questionário.
Uma entrevista pessoal. Falta o calor humano.
"Uma das coisas mais lindas que conheci foi o Nosso Credo. Realmente foi uma inspiração de quem a escreveu, pois colocou em palavras tudo o que sentia e esperava da empresa em todos os sentidos.

Porém, sinto que as pessoas envolvidas direta e indiretamente nos processos seletivos não praticam as orientações do Nosso Credo. Fazem cinco anos que venho me candidatando a inúmeras vagas para as quais tenho experiência e conhecimento, para as quais tenho certeza de poder contribuir muito com a J&J, mas, sequer tenho uma única oportunidade nem mesmo para participar apenas dos testes, quanto mais realmente ser contratado. E, olha que nem com a indicação/recomendação de amigos colaboradores da própria J&J eu consigo ser chamado.

Estou redigindo este ""desabafo"", pois a tristeza, o sentimento de incapacidade, impotência, tem tomado conta de mim. Sei que não passará de um desabafo, pois infelizmente não consigo acreditar que estas pesquisas sirvam para melhorar, para fazer justiça, mas para marcar ainda mais como indesejado quem é honesto, sincero e, tem a coragem de falar contra o poder opressor.

Peço desculpas, a quem ler, mas, eu não sei mais o que fazer. Eu tenho uma admiração enorme pela J&J. A J&J faz, sempre fez e, continuará a fazer parte da minha vida, de alguma forma permanecerá em mim. Já pensei em desistir de fazer inscrições para as oportunidades oferecidas pela J&J, mas um último sopro de esperança me impede de dar as costas, mesmo tendo a certeza que jamais serei um colaborador J&J.

"Um email rápido, parce que contrataram a pessoa, e só depois avisaram os outros candidatos."
U
"Tuve varias dificultades para aplicar, ya que en repetidas ocasiones al dar click en el link de recomendación, me salia error 404"
Tudo está ótimo 
"Try to listen to the maximum number of candidates in person, so that you can get to know the candidates better and make a positive choice with the profile of the vacancy. thanks for the opportunity."
"Try to be more personal, get closer to the potential candidate, according to the experiences and their qualifications"
"TRATAR DE TENER MAS COMUNICACION, SE CONTINUE EN EL PROCESOMO NO"
Transparency
Tou should give feedback about all steps. 
Tornar mais claros os requisitos que serão avaliados para a posição.
Too impersonal
Tomar en cuenta las habilidades y experiencia de los interesados ... en lo personal tengo amplia experiencia en este tipo de procesos...
"Todo proceso debe mejorar o tener un plan de mejoramiento continuo, por lo que si es interesante que las vacantes sean conocidas por personal externo a la compañía, para así generar oportunidad a dicho candidatos."
"Todo o candidato espera um feedback da vaga pela qual se inscreveu e muitas vezes a JJ somente envia um e-mail automático avisando que os principais requisitos não foram preenchidos, mesmo que na hora de aplicar para a vaga o candidato tenha confirmado que atende a todos eles, sem ao menos dar a oportunidade de conhecer o candidato pessoalmente realizando uma entrevista com ele.
Portanto acredito que no processo de recrutamento poderia haver maior clareza do motivo pelo qual o candidato não foi aprovado para a próxima etapa."
TODO ESTA PERFECTO
Todo esta muy bien generado en él proceso
Today i can't see details to improve the recruitment process. In this case the process is one of the better that I participated.

All I know of this recruitment is that we would receive an email with more information, but do not know when is that going to happen.
Apart from that, the process is excellent."
"To improve the process is important to open acess to people without experience as curriculum, because they need a opportunity to start a professional life "

"To give the candidate an opportunity, I have already applied for several positions and at no time did I have a return of the company to proceed with one of the processes. I believe I have a good resume and I am discouraged to receive only search emails and have some email that Johnson & Johnson sends that seems to have participated in some other aspect of the process without this happening, I also see as a positive aspect of Company give us a position, but it would be cool if the company goes down a greater opening to meet the candidate."

Time of feedback
"This was the worse hiring process that i had ever been. They never gave me a feedback regarding many process, this is disgusting."
"This position has already been posted (Vision Care Product Manager). It was on J&J Career site last December, but with a different name (Marketing Manager, Vision Care). Improvements that are needed:

- Give feedback to all people that took part of the process, especially those who actually had an interview. In my case, I had an interview for Marketing Manager (Vision Care) in December, but never had an answer after that, even after sending emails and asking if the process had been finished or not.

- Don't post positions that are not intended for external audience. It happened before with J&J positions: they are published and suddenly one week later, they are taken out from the site and closed. It seems that the people posting those positions are only following J&J's procedures, even if they already have someone from inside to fill the role. This kind of attitude only gives false hope for those applying.

- It's very hard to be interviewed or even to be considered for working at J&J, even if the candidate has the credentials and experience. I'd recommend you to be less reliant on employees' suggestions and be more fact based on the hiring process. This is particularly strong on developing countries, such as Brazil. It probably happens less frequently in the US."
This kind of iniciatives without a doubt is going to make better the process
"This is the first time that I am applying for a job at J&J and this survey and was interesting thing, which you want to hear more from us "" candidate"" of what we would expect from the Company.

I do not have much further to comment by now!


But, congrats for the survey approach!


"
"This is the first time I make an application at J & J, as well as, the first time I do a test like this. I think it´s interesting an interview, I believe a conversation can also evaluated the candidate."
This is the first time I apply to a process at Johnson & Johnson
"This is the first Step of this process. J&J is a very known Co. and using Technology as a tool to speed up the proces and make some filters is indeed necessary. 
So, in this way, I'm not totally able to give some strong opinion about J&J recruitment process, because I don't know further steps."
This is the first comunication since i apply to the position (more than a month ago) it would be nice to know un which stage i'm currently in or if muy profile was rejected. Regards
"This is my first time attending a recruitmnent process at Johnson & Johnson. I just know the website where I did my application. So I think everything is ok, until now. There is nothing to suggest for you to improve. "
"This is my first recruitment process at Johnson & Johnson. Until now everything is Ok, but I'd like to know if you give us a feedback, even we're not selected. It is important to know why we have not been selected. That way, we can improve and, perhaps, get a future opportunity."
"This is a nice recruitment process, hope I can be considered for an interview and show my skils ans experience in order to help J&J metrics."
"This case was with perfect management, including the communication, that is a typical weakness in the process. "
they should say the reasons why you don`t proceed with the application to work since knowing you could improve yourself by seeing the weaknesses
"They should provide more information about the selection processes, such as where they are"
They should let the candidates that are not continuing the process as soon as they are left out. Not when the person they hire is already in the second week training in the company !!!
They should fit the maximum age required not to apply.
"They have not called me to tell me if I am a candidate or not for the job. I am very interested in joining J&J for many reasons, I just want an opportunity to demonstrate my abilities and expertise.

Thank you very much in advance. I expect to hear from you."
"They have a great process, in my case I would like to know what were the things that affects to continue in the battle for the staff engineer vacant. However I reallly appreciate that I got a notification from J&J that I was not selected"
"They do not give feedback because one is not a candidate for posisicon, I consider that there is discrimination for my age"
"They can do that people who is interested in a job position, they could visit the company to know more about they can do in it. "
"There was no update on my application whatsoever, which was very disappoiting and the reason why I couldn't go higher than 7 on the previous question."
"There should be direct interviews with the candidate and not only through the web, as well, that give the opportunity to show the skills to the position in a type of assasment, because most of the time that is only through Its website, is not a fair process, in my opinion.

Best regards and thanks."
There is no need for any change for me.
There is no necessity of improvement until now.
There are too many questions that are answered by the CV that can be uploaded.
There are job positions that do not require any knowledge of English. It was not the case of my selection process. But I believe that for these processes without knowledge of the English language the filling in Portuguese would help the candidates.
The wider recruitment through the internet can help the company to obtain more improvment and succeed.
The website needs to create a better way to upload resumes.
The website must have an option for Spanish
The way to improve the recruitment process is to check the skill at the beginning to refuse one of them and after that to make some test on line to select more of them and in the end to meeting to get the right professional worker.
The way to access the job search site is not intuitive.
"The talents acquisition team already performs an excellent job in this reputed company, but could improve the site for advertise the vacancies!
On the johnson & johnson company site, specific icons could be placed for each vacancy in its definite areas, as well as an icon with all Janssen-only posts, an icon only for jonhson & jonhson surgical area and icons with vacancies only for people with disabilities Physical. Currently on the site all the vacancies are mixed on the same page of the site, there are icons for that vacancy, but there are no specific icons for each area of the company."
"The site is very slow and can not complete your registration.
Sometimes opportunities are not visualized on the Brazil site."
The site could be improved to be more userfriendly.
"The shortest response time.
Thanks.
"
"The selective process, in my opinion, should consider aspects that analyze beyond all that is observed as the abilities and qualification, should value the character and the suitability of the candidate, for that the face process could support.

Thank you"
The selection process that I attended at Johnson & Johnson was wonderful. The professionals were very attentive and enlightening with me. I have no suggestions on how to improve this process as it was excellent. Congratulations! 
"The selection process is fine.However, I didn't have the opportunity to have the interview for the role (Customer Connectivity Lead), nevertheless the intention of J&J applying and interviewing me for another role where my abilities fit was remarkable and the attention was great."
"The selection process could be a bit faster. There's a concentration of companies recruiting for summer internships in the beginning of each year, and generally when MBAs receive an offer they have a short period of time (from 2-4 weeks) to accept it or not."
The same reason that I already explain more feedback why the company not consider me for the position 
"The role I am applying for is in Cali, Colombia. I came to the position offer from “Indeed” and an improvement to your recruitment process could be to insert the position in local agencies such as “elempleo.com” or “computrabajo”, that could lead to obtain more candidates. "
The reputation the company has its the key driver for me to apply for the position. Very respected worldwide.
The recruitment team should give a small analysis of the areas of opportunity or failures so that the candidate works in those areas
"The recruitment process, could return to the candidate, the information that he does not have the desired profile for the process, avoiding that the candidate, is waiting for a next step in the process."
The recruitment process was quite smooth and adequate. Congrats!
"The recruitment process was a little long, but i thing was correct because a company like J & J needs to select its employees with patience and intelligence for the company's interests."
"The recruitment process until now, it has been uncomplicated. I think It would be nice  for the applicants, to know the next steps and the times in the recruitment process. Thanks for your interest. "
The recruitment process shoud incluye Spanish as an option. 
the recruitment process right now is better
The recruitment process provided a robust role description and overview.
"The recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson is very straight, objective and complete. I had no difficulties at all to fill and submit my application and maybe the only improvement axis that I could suggest is on the role description, with more details regarding the job responsibilities and working environment, considering the regional scenario that the job is being offered.
 
 "
The recruitment process of Jhnoson & Johnson it's oriented to give a whole vision of the position available and to provide the information needed to find a good fit for the role. I find it hard to identify something that could be improve but i would recommended to maintain communication flow with the candidates because it differentiates you from other companies.
The recruitment process must go through an analysis of the profile and suitability of the candidate to ensure the best performance for the company.
"The recruitment process it is clear, it is ok."
The recruitment process is very practical and dynamic.
The recruitment process is very impersonal and follow-up should be provided to candidates who apply. I was disappointed of the manner in which the whole process develops. No feedback whatsoever from HR representatives with respect on how the interview process is going.
The recruitment process is very good. I don't have suggestions.
The recruitment process is very good.
"The recruitment process is very good, but it could be clearer as to the job.
The site is very good and facilitates the recruitment process."
"The recruitment process is very easy, all of us are waiting just for good news "
The recruitment process is very correct and fair.
"The recruitment process is very clear, clean and organized. The only thing that i see is the time to response about a postulation, sometimes are very long."
The recruitment process is very clear in all the steps. I would like to have an opportunity to participate with more and more professional and personal details inside this process and an example would be an opportunity to make an interview. Thanks & Best regards.
The recruitment process is very clear and easy to understand.
"The recruitment process is satisfactory
"
"The recruitment process is perfect, I like the following recruitment process because that mean Johnson & Johnson really care about the people."
The recruitment process is perfect in this way
the recruitment process is ok.
"The recruitment process is great, but they could have more feedback to know what stage we are in and if we don't go through, I would like to know where the phase I was. 
Thanks for the opportunity!"
The recruitment process is excellent.
The recruitment process is excellent. 
"the recruitment process is cover all points . great.!! 

Regards,

Ricardo."
The recruitment process is already good and clear in this current state.
The recruitment process is adequate
The recruitment process in Johnson & Johnson is very good. I don't see any more factor to consider to improve the way how you perform the interviews. Thanks.
"The recruitment process have a perfect model, is easy to apply, I think is satisfatory! "
"The recruitment process from J&J is cleared and obviously, I appreciated the Talent Acquistion department."
The recruitment process could include a meeting with the candidate. 
"The recruitment process could be improved through calendar with the main dates that will be happen interviews, tests and all the process stages with prior disclosure."
"The recruitment procedure of Johnson & Johnson seems to me to be quite adequate, and in my opinion there is no relevant suggestion to be made. Of course, how much more clear the job description to be carried out about the position available, better will be the chances of capturing more qualified candidates.


"
The recruitment needs to have a human contact
"The recruiting process was really good and effective. where I see a chance to grow as a company in Mexico and be more productive when receiving new people is in their onboarding process, training and delivering the tools we need to work. For instance mobile phone, business cards, iPad, car, amex company card for business expenses etc they take too long to process everything and we are currently working without our much needed tools."
"The question about GPA is impossible to leave blank or leave as a ""N/A"". My school has a strong non disclosure policy regarding grades and my only option was either to break it or leave it as a 0 that can potentially harm someone's chance while applying if applications are then filtered by a minimum GPA. "
"The publication is quite clear, the medium of communication is good and the fact that they communicate with the candidate makes it a more personalized experience"
The process was very transparent from the beginning and I was confortable with both HR and manager approaches
"The process was very friendly and the people were kind and showed to be proud of the company and the values. 
My only suggest is to ensure the feedback to all the candidates once the decision is taken.
"
The process was unique 
The process was pretty clear and fast. I suggest no changes in the recruitment process
The process was clear and easy to follow. I didn't find any problem 
"The process to upload the resume and fill the informartions is working well. The only improvement that could be made was about the description, because I saw this job opportunity more like a Product/Marketing/Business Manager role instead of Latin America Real World Evidence Manager."
"The process passed in a positive wa and I hope to participe in the next position in the area of specialities.
Grateful for attention!

The process is straightforward and efficient. I don't have any problem with it 
"The process is simpe and not tedious, so I Think , is not necesary a change, at least in this first stage for calling it somehow"
The process is OK. The company will know step by step the experience of the candidate

The process is fine for me.  I have no suggestion to improvement so far and hope to have the opportunity to move on to the other stages of this selection.
The process is clear...
The process is already very positive.
The process is already quite satisfactory.
"The process could run faster, or could put more section and more filter process. "
The process could be more easy and fast. I think that is very slow  
"The process can be much better if the recruiter explains the reasons why the company did not choose you, or in other way, provide feedback in order to improve professionally for future interviews."
The process can be improve with more human contact.
The process as a whole was really long. An improvement would be to make it faster!
"The process are perfect at the moment, nothing wrong "
The process are fine.
"The process (up until now) feels a little non - human, automated and undetached.

Would like to recieve e-mail responses that are not automatic / robot like / generic responses that would apply to any person and application.

Even with this survey, it feels that really nobody is actually receiving, reading and evaluating my information... its the modern take on ""please leave your cv at the door and leave""..."
"The proccess of recruitment is clear, and in this oportunity is all clear and easy."
The positive or negative answer should be more rapidly sent to us.
"The position of Assistant Scientist (1700158998W) was hard to find because the browse must be in English, if you search it in Spanish the browser responde was no existing. Someone had to tell me to do the search in English in order to find the position."
"The option to attach  files (resume, cover letter ,etc) later is very good. But at the end of the process when I used this option , it was no clear if the file , finally, arrived to my submission . I received a mail saying that all is ok, but in my job page don't appear the cover letter. 
It will be better at the end of attach process to see the documents in the submission form"
"The only point of observation that I have is that the company notifies you that at least it evaluated your curriculum and notifies you of the strengths and weaknesses observed regardless of whether you are a selected candidate or not.
I hope with great enthusiasm to be able to belong to the great family Johnson & Johnson"
The new way for applying through workday is very nice
"The most important thing for a candidate, is to have an answer, or 5 minutes to present itself to a person. That would make a real difference. The automated recruitment process itself, and the tools, are really secondary."
"The most important is that the participants in the process get a feed back of the process state, because the most of times we never hear you again and we don't know if we stayat the process or not"
"The mail that directed me to this questionnaire, was the first step of the process, I believe it to be a great start. "
The long time to hear any news about the process.
The link that I received was in fail. The opportunity didn't exist. 
"The level of involvement of the candidate could improve and have a closer communication to follow up the process. 
I currently do not know how the applications to which I applied"
"The jonhson & jonhson company already has a very talented team for recruiting highly qualified professionals. To further improve it could be separated on the jonhson & jonhson website job vacancies as vacancies for Janssen would open a field for these vacancies, vacancies for jonhson & Jonhson in surgical area other field, area sales other field and vacancy for disabled other field. It is not actually separate, they are all released together, the vacancies are mixed."
The Johnson & Johnson recruitment process is very clear and specific. I Think not require changes or improvements
"The J & J team  should closely look at the CV & the candidate , in my case it look they have not read my CV properly , else whatever was required by the employer i have almost everything in it . 

Moreover i would like to know precisely the reason why i was not selected if that is the case & not only me the candidate should know why they have not been selected so that if they don't have in it they should work hard on those points. 

hope i am very much clear Sir.

"The greater amount of information about the job, ever will be desirable for the applicant. Thanks."
The follow-up about the recruiment status.
"The first sieve of the curriculum should value other names of Colleges. Not only expensive colleges, because it only has a rich trainee. 
There is a need for more social and cultural exchange. Insertion of persons of other social classes. "
The feedback is not being done!
The feedback is a little bit slowly.
The currently process was pretty good to me.
The current way is very good
The current process is completely satisfactory.
The current process format met my expectations.
The current process format met my expectations.
The contact by phone is very important to the candidate in every step. 
The company to report why the candidate was not approved for the job.
The company to do job interviews
The company should send the steps of the process.
The company should notify the status of the recruitment process. I never knew the reason why my application was not taken account.
THE COMPANY SHOULD GIVE FEEDBACK FOR ALL THE PROCESSES AND CANDIDATES...
The company must notify the candidates of a position about the process conclusion to which it aspires.
The company Johnson & Johnson call for interview in person. 
The company is competent and efficient in the recruitment process.
"The company has to encourage the values of people, in a personal interview must know the goals of the professional and know how you want to achieve it by making use of your skills and values."
"The company has been able to place more job alerts on more web pages.
Give the opportunity to new professionals.
Send mail indicating that CV has been read with positive response or maybe indicate that for now they do not meet the profile for the position."
"The company give a description about the role but not always the employer will have it so it is about development and give the opportunity to prove it, each one has a differents experiences and have or provide value to the company. Not only the company look for a employer, the person look for a good company also than fit with his/her profile and goals."
"The company could make more selections in different places, to give more opportunities and vacancies of work. But I am very into the proccess waiting for challenges. "
"The company could give return to the candidates, and, when applicable, inform if the candidate is participating or no in the process and, if not, why not."
The company could give feedback to candidates even if negative or positive
The company could feedback the candidates in each step of the process.
The communication with the candidate according with the phase of the process.
"The communication definitely can be improved, as during the process you as a candidate do not receive any feedback or whether you continue in the recruitment and there are long periods of time when you do not hear anything about it."
"The careers and jobs website could work better (many careers website page appears as ""page not found"").
It would be nice to have a candidate area where we could see the progress of our application process."
"The candidate should know at each stage of the process what their outcome has been and give feedback that could be improved for the next step.

In the end, if the candidate does not get the job it is important give an explanation, for example, why he or she was not the ideal candidate for this job and what kind of skills should improve for future recruitment process.
"
The c candidate should know the reason why was not considered I was really interested in this role despite in just 4days I received the E mail notifying that I was not selected. 
"The automation of the process, brings benefit of the agility and processing of a large number of candidates, but the knowledge, experiences and copetences are left out, as the technical and psychological evaluation is lacking, and collections of certificates and titles shows that they are worried about the qualification and not with the training and development potential."
The application webpage is easy to use. I think there is nothing to improve.
The application process is very easy and intuitive. The step by step questionnaire is way better than have all questions in the same page. 
"The actual recruitement process is satisfactory, It would be nicer , however, if the company return were faster."
that`s ok
That's OK.
That was really good.
"That the vacancies appear in both English and Spanish, because in many cases they are not found"
That the response times for applicants are a little faster
That the process does not have to be performed from the company intranet
"Thank you for your attention in improving the hiring process.

I received a e-mail, but I was in travel 

My suggestion: Is possible send a message by WhatsApp or SMS to confirm the interview?

Thank for all J&J HR time"
"Thank you for send me a survey,

But at the moment I couldn’t say anything about the process, because I have not been contacting for an interview or something similar.

"Talent process in J&J Mexico is not fair. Considering comments from close friends who had Global companies experience and competences, knowledge on several languages, and been graduated in TOP 3 Universities have agreed on the same = You need to be friend of the Talent staff to get a chance to be called for interview and to work in J&J. Probably a refresh in the Talent staff would be good option to improve, Karla Oviedo´s team needs to develop a better Talent work with more fairness, openess and clearness. Everyone who is skilled and has the requiered job expertise to fit the job description, deserves to have the same opportunity to work for J&J and develop an outstanding career. I beleive in J&J Creed but in some reason I dont see reflected in the Actual Talent team.  Thanks"
"Take time to have a call or meeting with the candidate in order to evaluate their skills and know about their experiencia, not only review the CV and for othe hand not start with the question regarding salary because in the most of the times the recruiters takes more into consideration this información than know the knowledge, experiencia and skills of the candidate

Take tests online before interviews
Take more personal skills
Take less time in the process. And contact people by phone.

Sugiero que exista Un feedback al postulante en caso no sea seleccionado al puesto.
"Suggestion:
Complement the vacancy with information that the candidate can identify his career plan that the company offers, management characteristics, forms of remuneration and benefits.
It could also complement with information that the candidate can identify the desired professional style for the vacancy in question.

Soon answers about the process.
"Sometimes you get error on the website, when you are completing the application"
Sometimes the vacancies do not appear on the J&J page.
"Sometimes the information does not appear on the Johnson&Johnson page.
"
"Sometimes the candidate identifies 2 vacancies that have potential, but when you register you end up putting information that can characterize to a vacancy not having habillidades. You could have more questions that would help identify your skills for both vacancies.
I do not know, if I was clear in my explanation."
Sometimes takes too long to give a feedback 
Sometimes it takes too long for provide and answer or feedback about the process. It could look like impersonal
Sometimes I do believe that I have been misjudged as a potential candidate
Sometimes careers website does not work properly and keep presenting the error 404. Very difficult to login even you sure about your password 
"sometimes  i had troubles  for postulate to this job, becouse the pag  sended  an error, and showed   like  this  job didn´t exist . so i had to try many times until  it  worked. this was the only  complication i found in the process and could  be best, and give  more  flow to this process. "

"Since I have not yet been called to attend an interview, there is still a sentiment of insecurity as to whether recruiters will be able to carefully examine my CV or if by using an electronic proxy to narrow the number of applicants considered fit for the position I would not get this chance. It would be wonderful if Johnson&Johnson could be transparent as to the process of selecting people for an intervew.   "

Shorter standby time
She can improve better details the precess recruitment 
Share in the site the paygrade of the position.
"Several Public Colleges have online plataforms for students and graduates seeking Jobs. I think that being a No 1 company like J&J is, and staying there requires top of the line employees, who know hard work and are constantly trying to improve. Most of them, at least in Argentina, come from these Public Colleges. So I think that expanding your Job Offers to this plataform would improve not only the recruitment porcess but also the quality of it.

Kind Regards"

Recruitment process was objective and quick.
"recruitment process should be  free from any bias like race ,ethnicity, country origian."
Recruitment process looks good for me in perspective to olther companies I've known.
"Recruitment process from J&J is perfect. Maybe we, as senior professionals, could just have some chances to show how we can be explored and agregate value to these big companies, by having a conversation with someone from the company and not just be based on our resume."
"Recruitment interviews are a crucial and crucial stage that can not be overlooked or improvised. It should be understood that employees are not machines or robots available, they are people who deserve the most attention and respect; Therefore, it is best to leave aside those generalized, unilateral and impersonal interviews and opt for real conversations, in which the candidates are heard and communicated to each of the company's needs, expectations and, of course, what It has to offer them.

At the same time, do not be afraid to want to know a little about the personal life of your candidates. We know it may be a not so easy to address subject, but keep in mind that all people have a personal life that in fact occupies most of their mind and attention, so these are data that can in some way or another help you To know if the candidate is or is not the one indicated."
"Recruitment department need to review an important factor in the employees who apply to the positions, Experience, sometimes experience has more weight than education level. Recruitment department need to establish a method to evaluate this factor."

"Quando me inscrevi no processo seletivo da Johnson & Johnson optei por considerar as vagas destinadas à profissionais com deficiência devido minha condição. Apesar do meu grau de limitação ser muito pequeno, acredito que os processos seletivos da empresa devam ser orientados a melhor identificar o perfil desse profissional, e sua compatibilidade com a vaga pleiteada. Algumas cias, devido preconceito institucional, não adotam esse tipo de política de inserção, ou se a possuem, optam por escolher profissionais ""saudáveis"" em detrimento aqueles que teoricamente trazem algum tipo de limitação, sem sequer averiguar se, de fato, aquele não se encaixaria na vaga oferecida pela cia.
Sendo assim, acredito que os processos de recrutamentos deveriam ser conduzidos por uma política real de inserção que possibilite à esse tipo de candidato uma concorrência honesta e imparcial às ""vagas destinadas"" à eles.   "

Podrían hacer entrevistas via skype.
Poderiam inserir o idioma português ( Brasil ) como opção para o processo de preenchimento da candidatura à vaga. 
Poderiam dar chane para os profissionais q não tem superior; pq nem todos q não tem é pq não quer e sim por não ter condições financeiras para bancar os estudos. E também tem muitos profissionais com garra pra trabalhar que não tem a chance de mostrar suas qualidades. E assim prosperar na empresa.
"Poderei dar maiores informações e me posicionar melhor, ao ser chamada para a próxima etapa do processo, como uma entrevista, por exemplo.

"Pienso que Johnson & Johnson podría aumentar la cantidad de candidatos a los posiciones ofertadas brindándole a mayor escala la oportunidad a extranjeros de participar en los procesos de reclutamiento, y así, el candidato tenga posibilidades de formar parte de la organización. Para ello, la compañía puede utilizar herramientas como pruebas en linea y entrevistas por Skype para una posible contratación. "
"Pienso que Johnson & Johnson es una empresa muy solida y que si su proceso de seleccion de personal es diferente a los de las demas empresa es por que son muy cuidadosos para saber a quien contratar.
Pero si creo que deberia ser mas abierto a que otras personas vean sus vacantes."
"Pienso en lo personal que después de una encuesta virtual , seria bueno que el 2do filtro fuera personal para así saber un poco mas del aspirante a la dicha vacante."

Personal intervew
Personal discussions would be appreciated.

Perhaps there are steps could be simplify. The goal would be in a click the general application and separated the particular requirements for the position. 
"Perhaps show details of work day by day
And the possibilities to growth on carrear.  "
Perhaps provide more time to the recruited ones share their experiences as well as knowledge about the role.
Perhaps it would be helpful to the candidate if you could give him/her a date by which (if not contacted) their application would be considered unsuccessful so that the candidate can continue with the stressful process of job hunting.
"Perhaps giving more transparency about next steps, for example, giving a deadline to give about the decision for next phase."
Perhaps a feedback to the candidate about his approval or not.
Perform a phone call interview when candidates meet all specified hard requisites before disregarding the candidacy.

"Para melhorar um processo de recrutamento e seleção existem vários fatores importantes em um candidato a ser levados em conta.Hoje em dia muitas empresas buscam candidatos por indicação de alguém que já trabalhe na corporação, ao meu pensar tem muitos candidatos bons que cadastram currículo no site e acabam não sendo chamados por causa de indicação.
Tem fatores primordiais como:definir já o perfil do candidato para a vaga tendo um perfil a empresa não perdera muito tempo buscando outro candidato,investi em um bom recrutamento também e muito importante,outro fator essencial acredito que seja a linguagem corporal pois e onde o candidato revela tudo sobre ele com gestos, inquietação.
Com isso a empresa reduz gastos e tempo porque ela já sabe quem contratar.
Eu sou uma candidata que vivo atualizando meus dados no site mas ate agora não surgiu uma oportunidade acredito que eu não tenha o perfil que estão buscando mas minha hora chegara.

Atenciosamente,

Aparecida Veríssimo Silva"

"On May 9th around 10am I received a call to my cell phone from a person of the company in the context of my postulation to the position of Governnent Affairs Senior Manager (1700158011W) at Johnson & Johnson de Chile, S.A. Unfortunately for these purposes, I was starting a meeting with high authorities and international guests, so I asked the person to communicate with me for the next hour, certainly appreciating the contact. After several hours without receiving the new call, I tried to communicate with the person during that same afternoon and the next day, without success. The experience was certainly frustrating, because of the person's commitment to communicate with me again and the fact that the call coincided, unfortunately for this purpose, in a work meeting. Without a doubt, it would be a privilege to have been considered in the process and if the same remains open, enter into it, whenever appropriate. I would be grateful to know what happened so that it does not happen again in the future. And, certainly, consider my greater disposition to be part of the future processes of selection that are considered pertinent and opportune for my profile. I reiterate my thanks. Best regards.

"O processo é bem prático. Acredito que, apenas para cargos onde o inglês exigido é o básico, poderia ser em português. 
"
"O processo de recrutamento tem que entender as exigências do cargo (conhecer a vaga e as tarefas que serão desempenhadas) e buscar profissionais com o perfil que atende os pré requisitos para o cargo, além do mais precisa analisar se o candidato tem competências técnicas e comportamentais e que se adaptam a cultura da empresa."
"O processo de recrutamento da Johnson & Johnson é um processo sério que respeita cada candidato igualmente, recebi e-mail em todas as minhas candidaturas e de forma gentil e respeitosa, isso é muito importante e aumenta o meu sonho para fazer parte deste time, desta familia... Mas acho que há possibilidades de entendimento em uma candidatura mesmo que suas qualificações não seja 100% igual a descrita na vaga, as vezes, um candidato tem conhecimento na área, mas não teve a oportunidade de crescimento seja na empresa em que trabalha ou na empresa que trabalhou, mas é importante e que pode ser considerado é a força de vontade, determinação e a disposição em aprender e crescer profissionalmente e contribui com a companhia."
"O processo de recrutamento até o ponto que participei foi muito claro e objetivo. Fornecendo as informações sobre as atividades e atribuições do cargo.
"
"O primeiro passo a ser tomado antes de iniciar o processo de recrutamento é definir o perfil do colaborador desejado. Para isso, basta responder algumas perguntas como: Quais são as funções a serem exercidas na vaga em aberto? Que características e qual formação profissional o colaborador deve ter para exercê-las?

Sabendo de antemão que tipo de pessoa você está querendo contratar, fica mais fácil direcionar a sua busca para encontrar o profissional ideal para preencher aquela vaga. Além disso, dessa forma, os próprios candidatos poderão saber o que é esperado deles e analisar se têm interesse ou condições de participar do processo seletivo."
"O participante do processo não recebe muitas informações se irá ser chamado ou não, o restante é tudo ótimo, boas vagas e site de fácil acesso."
"O formato do processo já é muito bom. Bastante objetivo e direto. Talvez seja interessante disponibilizar a tradução em mais línguas; para os que possuem inglês intermediário. Mas, não chega a ser um fator totalmente significante."

"My suggestion would be to all the recruiters be like Nathalia Athia, she really follows the credo treating the candidate as an important person, given and asking feedback after the process, never leaving the candidate without a track regarding the process! I had a chance to participate in more than one process at Johnson & Johnson and definitely she enhance my wiliness to work in this great company! Unfortunately she's not taking care of this process and I'm blind if I continue or not participating."
"My recruitment process is still in the beginning, but a major differential in the process would be for the recruiter to give both positive and negative feedback so the candidate can better prepare for future opportunities."
"my process was absolutaly fair, and  I receive quickly   feed back about the process stage. 
The T&A  RH resource was  very competente. "
My opinion is that the recruitment process follows the correct parameters for employee selection
My only concern about process thru LinkedIn is the impersonality. So far I have no return about my candidacy. I believe that once past the first screaming some human contact would be nice and for those who did not pass some immediate information. 
My experience with Johnson & Johnson recruitment process is very important because all the information regarding the process is always very clear even I'm not going to make any interview or to participate in any process/test. I can see that the process is going more and more clear and the improvement is perceptive.
"My experience is that the process is pretty clear. The description was very well explained which makes it easier to understand if you can apply to the job.
"
"My comment is about the communication in case you are not chose for the position , iit is a good practice."
muy buena.
muy buena.
muy buena
much much improvement and comunication with candidates
"Most of the companies nowadays demand a lot of years of experience without giving the opportunity to those who want to grow and develop their knowledges. Instead of just listing the needed education, experience and training, they can also include the day-to-day activities of the position, or even what the new hire is expected to accomplish in the first 90 days of the job. 
Before requiring time of experience in a position, they could evaluate the effectiveness of the person and its potential through knowledge examinations including promoting growth within the company through recurrent trainings; in that way, we could determine if the candidate has been the one for the job."
More updates about the process
More up dates about the process.
More transparency in the selection and notify the other candidates why they were not considered for the vacancy

"Mayor reconocimiento a jovenes profesionales que buscan oportunidades de crecimiento profesional en la compañia, de la misma manera valoración al área Tecnologia de Información"
"Maybe, more information about the status of the selection process."
Maybe would be nice for the applicants to have a shorter process and some feedback along it as sometimes we apply for a position but have no information and have no idea how we are in the process.
Maybe wit responses faster and personalize
Maybe to keep in touch with the most appropiate candidates for the position so that the know if they are qualified for the job or not.
"Maybe to have response directly from the HR department in ech country in order to feel closer.

Thank you.

"Maybe the time to recruit and Resumes reading takes too long and the candidates must apply for another job, so you can miss some very good talents."
"Maybe the salary, although for a candidate like us, I think that the speed of response, whether positive or negative is the most important in the recruitment process. Thanks for the opportunity."

JOHNSON JOHNSON NEEDS to GIVE MORE & OPPORTUNITY for who EVER WORKED THERE
"Johnson is in my opinion, the best company to work, learn, grow and apply our knowledge. Improve the process of human resources could only give an opinion if there was mapping process, there are tools for that.

As external Candidate, I see point positives like in the registration, the opportunities, the return of the process, in the descriptions Jobs. 

And, an improvement that I could describe?! I could suggest that I am to be hired by Johnson and it would be a partnership with quality human resources throughout Company.

Johnson & Johnson should inform applicants about the process steps in order to be aware of real possibilities. I have not received any call or email yet about interviews or tests in which you can evaluate my personal skills and competences.
"Johnson & Johnson should be more personally involved on your part, but it is a mailing for failure and thank you. I think there are people at a certain level of the Company, who should appear, of course at the crucial moment of hiring, and give guidelines about what is missing or what is your deficit for the role but that is how to take it. To this they do not have to take it to lower the possible salary that they are going to pay by the deficiency of some or that part of the CV, but to incentivize the possible future employees."
Johnson & Johnson should be clearer in describing the skills to role.
Johnson & Johnson must provide greater support to candidates in order to identify the right profile for each applicant
Johnson & Johnson may have a little more contact with the applicant to demonstrate their experience and knowledge.
"Johnson & Johnson in my professional career was undoubtedly the best company I've ever worked with. Some factors have made me leave, but I consider the vacancy in question an opportunity to return because I believe in values, people and the creed."

J&J Talent Acquisition team must always give clear and detailed feedbacks whenever a candidate is not approved. Especially for internal candidates.
J&J should to consider all profiles of people focused in a Finance Center
J&J should give a better feedback for the candidates and make the process shorter or faster. It takes to long to have an answer (positive or negative)
"J&J recruiter's could give a follow up about the application process.
I have no information if I was accepted to take part in the recruitment process."

"I´d belive none because This company has an excellent reputation, and this is the reflection of the quality her. processes"
"I`d like to understand why my CV was dismissed so quickly if in my view my skills and experience were exactly what you needed. Otherwise, the impression is either the job description was not clear or there are other kind of prejudices "

"It´s very clear and easy. It is good same sites where you can see if the CV was read or not , or how many people apply the position"
It´s important to evaluate the personal qualities and last profesional experiences. Other culturies are very good and it can help to the good evolution in J&J.
Its Verly important to provide feedback to The candidate when the process ends. I didn' t receive the feedback and i knew the final resolution when i read The touchpoint email.
Its important that the recruit company gives a feedback to the applicant.
Its better!
Its a internal Police interview all the internal candidates and it was a great negative surprise when it not happens. Nobody contacts me.

Thank you."

It's fine the way it is."
It's been 3 weeks since I applied and so far I haven't a feedback. The status of the application remains the unchanged.
It's all OK
It's actually a great recruitment process.
"It's a great recruitment process, very attentive with the participants, I would not have to change anything. "
It's a good recruitment process. I would not change anything.
"It's a cute ""website"", I would like more communication on monitoring the application."
"It would help to the candidates to have a diagram of the selection process, which describes the following activities and steps, and finally indicating the candidate status."
It would be worthy if we had a response about the positions that I have applied.
"It would be very interesting to have a more detailed feedback after the recruitment process. 
"
It would be useful to describe the steps of the recruitment process. 
It would be useful if the applicant could track the process along his/her candidate's page. It would be very candidate friendly. 
"It would be nice, if you are not consider a candidate, to receive a notice. I have been contacted by recruitment J&J employees but I do not recall receiving a notification once I am no longer consider a candidate. "
"It would be nice to track the application process. There are Softwares like Taleo, in which the applicants can do that. For a great company as J&J, it would be very candidate friendly. 

"
It would be nice to receive updates about where we are in the process.
It would be nice to know the development of the job applications.
It would be nice to have a feedback. I just receive an email which was mentioned Global Recruitment Team had decided not to proceed with my candidacy for the position of Regulatory Affairs Manager (1700146788W).
"It would be lovely to receive updates about the process, sometimes (not this process particularly) the process closes and the candidates don't receive any feedback about it. It hasn't to be a specific feedback on he personal aplication, but at least a notice of the process finalization would be nice."
It would be interesting that all candidates received a return explaining why they were not selected for the job.
"It would be interesting if the process could be applied in the candidate's native language. In addition to this I found two homepages for application of the vacancies, the site that was in Portuguese I could not find the vacancy that I applied and had fewer opportunities than the English site, but I realized that my registration (login and password) was valid for both Homepages"
"It would be important to answer the process, in my case I never knew anything."
It would be ideal to inform the applicant if was selected or not
"It would be great to hear soon from you, at least to know if I continue in the process or not.I have applied to a couple of jobs and what I see is that many times they don´t give you feedback, if the position was given or if its still a headcount you really don´t know what happened. I know its difficult as many people apply but it would be very cool to know it. "
"It would be great to have someone in HR to call and ask about the role.
In my case, I believe I have a variety of life and professional experiences which would help me to succeed in some posted roles so it would be nice to be able to communicate them to a HR member."

It was very satisfactory to receive a notification of the selection of the process despite not being considered between  the candidates
"It was very clear and simple, I really appreciated the fact that you can apply through different platforms/formats"
"It was a very respectful and engaging proccess, with good level of interaction with the hiring team (hiring manager, peers, T&A, headhunter... 

The obly point ai would appreciate to have a  more specific and clear description was aboute the company benefits (vehicle policy/total value amount, pension plan, nuesery reimbursement value...).
The above benefits were only ""mentioned"" from hiring team but not clearly specifically described in the job offer/contract.

Thank you!"
"It takes too much time. I applied for two different roles, and when I finally received an email communicating that I was not being considered for interview, the email was not saying for which role it was about. "
"It seems to be very complete, nothing to add."
It seems fine.
"It might be to participate in public and private school job fairs, and give a real case to solve in a contest. So it can catch the new talent and J&J could give them an opportunity."
It making questions related with the skills and requirements for each opportunity.
"It isn't clear to me why receive 4 times the same survey for the same role, Progama Vendas Janssen (6 vagas). Is this an error or it part of the hire process? Thanks."
"It is very important to provide a narrow contact with the candidate, even if it is an eletronic plataform that can inform the status of the recruiting process is. I myself can say, most of the recruiting companies simply do not send an e-mail in regards of the received application nor let the candidate know whether this process has ended. In conclusion, I suggest J&J improve the ralationship with the applicant. "
It is very important to have feedback regarding how the process is developing
"It is very important that the Recruiter contact people who is Applying for a job to provide a feedback, a reazon why a person was not good fit for position."
"It is very complicated to become the idea of a person with the role alone, it would be very interesting to see the possibility of seeing some relationship, it is complex but the attitude outside the work is important to know."
"It is to early to conduct an assessment since I just applied, yet it would be very thoughtful of you if you provide further information about the application status. 

Thanks

"It is so difficult to give good suggestions about how to improve your recruitment process, when I only have participated in the beginning of the process I mean When I only sent my resume, I think could be better profitable if this survey is applied to people who have participated in a complete process of recruitment which includes interviews face to face with the recruiter, however below my points
Today is important to define the profession than the candidate must have to aply the position offered by J & J then I think is important not to open wide the range of professions who can aply for the position"

It is my first recruitment process at J&J. I am not able to give you my feedback about.

It is a good proccess. Maybe consider skills that are not directly related to the work.

"It has been fantastic experience in recruitment process on the job.
I'm sure it can be improved, but it's very very friendly."
"It has been a very good recruitment process. There was a fluid communication between HR and me. However I consider the only thing that Johnson & Johnson can do to improve it, it's to match the date of the entry with the date of the Kick Off, a very important meeting that can be very useful for my career at the company. I knew that it took place one week before my entrance, but I am sure that my team will update and give me all the important information. 
In conclusion it was a very serious and rigorous process, which guarantees me that I am being part of an excellent company. "
It gives more opportunities for PCDs with equal opportunities and the same opportunities that other professionals have.
"It does not need anything, everything is very clear."
It could improve the speed of response to the request; I think that this would close with a touch of gold the excellent process they take.
It could give feedback why the qualifications could not be leveraged and save the information for a next opportunity if this is not done yet.
It could be possible to notice the participants in wich phase are the recruitment process.
"It could be great to have a video ad of the job offer, this in order to maybe if possible get to know the office, the atmosphere and people working at J&J Chile."
It could be good to have a feedback from J&J for the applicant.
It ' s  the best recruitment that I' ve ever seen lately.

"In the beginning, the process of recruitment and selection was quite clear, explaining the stages of the same, indicating the roles and tasks that the selected person should perform. 

However, as the selection process progressed, the coordination for the final interviews, because the availability interviewer were more complicated to coordinate.

In addition, I consider that the person with whom I had the initial contact, was polite, responding quickly and clearly; However, in the middle of the process, another person wrote me which made me feel that the process wasn't going on as fluid as with the order contact, answering less quickly and keeping silence for aproximately a week.

Recommendations:

I believe that the closeness with the recruiter in charge of the process was favorable for the participant to feel oriented.

The annoucement of the interviews' re-schedules should be done a bit more in advance.

Due to the change of contact I had in the middle of the recruitment process, I believe it would be opportune for a single person to see the selection of a specific vacancy from start to finish. Or to introduce the new person in charge of the process. As I never knew if that new person was really in charge of the process or if she was the General Manager Assistant.

Thank you very much for the time provided and the opportunity to participate in the selection process.

I remain attentive to your future instructions in order to continue the recruitment process.

Regards,"
"In such a fast paced era, specially new generations want everything very quick, so I guess it could help for such new generations (18-26 year old), that Johnson and Johnson uses an ""application response time"" KPI (if not already being measured)

"In my point of view, I have already applied for several employment opportunities, but I have NEVER been called at least for an interview, or to participate in a selection process, even fulfilling ALL REQUIREMENTS, or even possess more qualifications than informed.
What happens? Could you explain?"
"In my particular case, after my first interview, the interviewer told me J&J was going to call me again on a certain date, but to date I have not received any call or communication at all."
"In my oppinion, the tools used during the Jonhson & Johnson job selection process are fairly objective and accurate."
"In my opnion, still keeping the complete information about the position to guarantee the most approximaty interested person, to apply the position.
Otherwise, try to explorate the behaivor of the candidate if they can match with the values of the company."
"In my opinion, the recruitment should do more questions, about situations in day by day at company, but i understand that is a long process, and maybe this will occur when the candidate pass by to the next step n this job application, nevertheless this recruitment is doing great so far."
"In my opinion, the recruitment process was very good. I have no suggestions."
"In my opinion, the recruitment process is good and inform the candidate all information needed"
"In my opinion, the questions are too many. You can reduce them for a faster process."
"In my opinion, Personal interviews is a good option for the recruitment process. "
"In my opinion, nothing relevant"
"In my opinion, J&J needs just keep update the recruitment process in a proper time. "
"In my opinion, it can accelerate the recruitment process without the applicant waiting a long time for the response to be positive or negative."
"In my opinion, is necessary a good feeedback to all candidates afeter a hiring entriview to all not hiring."
"In my opinion, if the manager have already a person to assume the position, should not be mandatory to open the opportunity. Every time that we accept an internal opportunity we need to talk with the managers and, although it's encouraged, it's little embarrassing and generates unnecessary expectation. "
"In my opinion, develop dynamics that recognize the values of people so that they are not filtered only by their age, gender, marital status.
Thanks for the opportunity!"
"In my opinion, be more personnal."
"In my opinion was well designed the application process, is similar to others where I participated in the past."
In my opinion the recruitment processes today have improved greatly will be shortened recruitment times and above all always informed in what status are the applications are either verbal telephone or via mail and that generates certainty and that there must always be A feedback on why yes because the candidate for the position is not hired since this will allow to improve the opportunities for a next process of postulation for some vacancy
"In my opinion the recruitment process it's  all right . All the process can be improve, then we can to say that continuous improvement can be applied in all the areas of the 
Knowledge.
I had a large experence at Embraer with continuous improvement and I would like to applied at the Johnson & Johnson Company.
Congratulation at you by the great process of selection of people

"In my opinion the recruitment process is very clear and precise, I have nothing to complain about it."
"In my opinion the recruitment process fits my necessities very well, and there's no need of improvement."
In my opinion the J&J recruitment process should have few questions about the role to make the first filter  for the HR.
"In my opinion johnson could interview the candidates in loco, because sent questionnaires can not always describe the profile of the candidate"
In my opinion J&J was a  complete and favorable process always asking for the human aspects for the job and the person that is in the seletion process
In my opinion J&J has a well established recruitment process tha could be improved with a more specific feedback 
In my opinion it would be better if we could have a closer communication with the company talking about the selection process.
In my opinion is a good strategy send a notification to applicants with the result of the application job. It's a very appreciated detail by applicants.
"In my opinion in Mexico the recruitment team never answer, I believe I have the potential but this is just a door closed because no one had the time to check my resume. "
In my opinion I agree with what Johnson & Johnson has presented so far.
In my opinion HR and recruitment team is doing great job. No complain on this matter. Kind regards
"In my opinion , i believe that all process that i participated was excellent for me, i learned so many things. All the recruitment process was perfect.
But unhappily i never had opportunity  to working at Johnson & Jonson, i hope one day, can show my best, and contribute to Johnson & Johnson with my work."
"In my opinion  just a feedback related if our CV match really with the position, and don`t take too long time to get in contacted to give us a feedback if we keep in the process or not ( and in these case, give us a reason, don`t just say `` sorry, it was not possible to choose you``
 "
In my job search those companies that took the time to reply and they took time to know me a little more (skills and trayectory) were the most memorable.
In my experience this recruitment process has been brief but consistent. I have felt comfortable and all the parties involved had given me the opportunity to make myself known.
"In my experience I would like more information why my application is not selected, why I'm not selected to the position, what that I need. In general more information. Thank you"
"In my case, the recruiment process has be correct. Maybe, the possibility to watch  the survey en others language, because the ask are important to candidate, and sometimes the people doubt of the correct interpretation of the language original to ask."
"In mails sent by the recruitment team (autoreply's), that state that the company won't be pursuing yoour candidacy for the position, it's not clear what description they are refering. In my case I was pursuing two different positions at the same time, and I didn't identify at the moment, from which I was being discarted."
"In general, I think that the process is clear and easy to apply, as an improvement, it could be a bit more personalized, perhaps make a call, communicating if one is according to the profile they are looking for or not, being all online is slightly impersonal, since you feel that you are only responding automatically"
"In general,  I consider the recruitment process Ok."
In general there should be more communication about the process. I have been waiting for a response for weeks and I got these poll request instead. 
"In fact, you can give more opportunities for experienced professionals."
In comparison with other big companies that apply Linkedin profiles; J&J was the simplest and easiest process . COngratulations!
"In Colombia, the process can be Improved using platforms as elempleo.com or computrabajo.com to enhance the visibility of the job offer."
"In case of the candidate does not meet the position requirements to continue the hiring process, it will be great if the Johnson & Johnson's recruitment process provides a link with the candidate's gaps.

When I tried to apply (feb 23rd) the system could not find the page, there was a note infoming that the appliance time has been ended, but the information I had was the dealine would be on feb 24 and unfortunately I was unable to apply the this opportunity."

"If someone is not selected, providing specific feedback of the reasons, so the candidates can have better changes in the future."

id like the process it was easy to complete and very quickly.  
"I've participated at the first step of recruitment process and in my opinion since the first contact by phone, e-mail conversation, schedule conversation and conference call everything was perfect. 

The conversation about my career and experience with talent acquision team it was pretty good with key and smarts questions helping to identify my characteristics and know if I have the professional and behavior skills to the position.

I hope to have the opportunity to go ahead in this process and achieve my professional dream that is to be part of Johnson & Johnson family.

"I've already applied for something like 6 different positions, all in quality. It would be nice if we could follow the moment our resumes are rejected on the website."
"I'm afraid that I have not information enough to answer this question in this moment, but first of all it's important to be aware about the vacancy status."
"I'am still in the begining and it´s my first time, so I can´t give any feedback yet"
I wouldn't change anything of the process. I think that it's fast and that it respects the privacy and the personal data
"I would suggest to provide feedback on the results of the recruitment process.

Thanks,"
I would suggest to improve the synchronization of the jnjtalentacquisition tool. Also you need to check the usability of the site.
"I would suggest to communicate candidate about the refused points during the selection process. Based on that, we would be able to improve. 
"
"I would suggest that recruitment should be more informative with the candidates.
proximately I have applied around six times and no answered received for all af them, I just was advised for two times. Even when I not the selected candidate."
I would recommend to inform whether the candidate is participating or not  the open recruitment process. 
I would recommend a little more personalized recruitment processes.
"I would like you to give to the applicants more feedback about the application process. Whether you  pass or not. I have sent many applications and I have received only one email saying that I am not elegible. However, the other applications did not have any response. Thanks in advance for taking me in account for this survey. 

Karen Olaya.  "
I would like to talk with someone from the company for a job enterview 
I would like to say something about the current interview process steps. If you take the login and password as an exemple the first step of the process could be done through the J&J intranet with no  need of the candidate to go until the J&J to do  the interview process this can be considered a new concept of sustainability also saving time and money.
I would like to recieve an answer about the recruitment process.
I would like to receive a feedback on my application
I would like to receive a feedback about this process because I have all requirements to participate and I just received an e-mail informing that they need a person with more experiences. 
"I would like to reach a personal interview, i only receive a call and not always people are in a nice place to take an interview."
"I would like to know why I did not get the job, specifically.
Besides, it would be interesting to know  what was my position in the ranking of candidates.

I Would like to have a personal interview in an attempt to get the job. 
I would like to get the opportunity to work in your team. I am prepared and have vast experience in the consumer industry. I will really appreciate to get the chance to work with you. Together  with my knowledge and training of all these year I am prepared to do my best as Apm.
I would like to congratulate Johnson & Johnson recruitment process. It is visible and consistent.
"I would like to be the opportunity to introduce myself to you, because all the time I was disqualificated without this chance. Maybe my resume does not show how good I am."
"I would like the deal was more direct and open with the person concerned in the vacancy since the start of the selection

Best regards..."
"I would like sugggestion that J&J reduce/optimize the period to select/chopes a candidate. Sometimes the process is too long, maybe months, and the candidate suffer until the final result. "
I would like receive your feed back about each process. 
"I would like receive an  information regarding of the final status of  the job position I was applying for. 
Best Regards,"
I would like more visibility on the steps of the recruitment process
I would like Johnson & Johnson to make a recruitment process more in person.
"I would have liked to receive an email informing about  the progress of the application process, because I only received an email in which I was asked to answer some questions, which I answered, but later I   was not contacted again in over a month.
So there remains the uncertainly of knowing whether the process was closed or not."
"I would do it more personalize, to feel like I'm not talking to a machine all the time. "
I would be great if we could use as first step the Linkedin easy apply option. 
I would be good for the candidate to know more details in the interview about the expectation of personality & the skills that Johnson & Johnson is looking for the role and how they see the future opportunities for that business unit and for the company.
"I wouId like to highlight two aspects. 
1) I have had some doubts when it comes to which business unit is offering the opportunity. I still do not know if it is a submission for Janssen, Consumer or Medical. From where I stand, it is important to know in order to understand better the necessary background. 

2) It would be nice to have some regarding the process run. It is very uncomfortable to not know if you are still participating or not."
I wish to meet the J&J family work and i think that would be an awesome experience. Thank you very much! 
"I wish I had been interviewed further.  I only got an HR interview and got a request to reduce my compensation expectation.  I was not able to reduce it and no further interviews were held.  I wish that expected compensation was not the main factor into consideration.

I was open to negotiation but I did not want to go down before further interviews."
I will definitely recommend to say candidates if they are interest on it's porfile or not.
I wasnt part of any recruitment process. I'm still waiting for an opportunity.
"I was referred to the position, but couldn't take the advantage of it because the link provided did not work."
I was pretty pleased with the recruitment process.
I was positively surprised by the referred through the career application page that enables the HR department that you know someone at J&J and the interest you have in the company. This type of tool demonstrates the type of company you are applying to. 
I was not called for any interview. Do not know why - again.
"I was never summoned to an interview or received any feedback, thanks."
I was never contacted.
"i was choosed for this job but i didn't have my engineer certificate yet so i wasnt able to get the opportunity, but all the process was really good, simple and fast"
I want to know if I'm going to be selected to take an interview.  I have not idea
I want tha answer time will be more fast
"I used  Chrome to fill out the recruiting form, some options didn't work properly, such as ""which countries I am allowed to work freely"""
"I understand would be in the appraisal of the candidate regardless of gender, color, race, age, but I understand that these are already points that are very well applied in assessments by Johnson."
"I understand that you may receive thousands of applications on a daily basis, but for me, is essential to know whether I still am being considered for that position. It would be nice to have a schedule of the recruitment process for each position, for instance: applications go to the date XX/XX, online interviews to XX/XX, group dynamics until XX/XX, and so on."
"I understand that through these tools you are able to process the data of a lot of possible candidates, but I still feel that human contact is an important factor."
I understand that the process is optimal
I understand that it is a satisfactory selection process.
I this is good also they can do skype call for more attractive to the employee
"I think, that is correct."
"I think, may be give feedbacks in a shorter time "
"I think you should have a more effective channel to give feedback when the person is not selected, in order to be ableto improve for future applications. "
"I think you could better coordinate how to contact the candidates once the application is made.
You called me once and I found myself in a meeting, I asked to be called in 2Hr and they said yes, but they never contacted me again. That was more than two weeks ago, so I dont Know if I´m still a candidate for the process."
I think you are doing an excellent job with the recruitment process. 
I think will be better improve the response time.
"I think usually the companies have a gap regarding feedback about the recruitment process. This is my first contact with J&J for an opportunity in this company and I really don´t know if the feedback about the recruitment process is a practice in the company but, considering the current survey I believe so. Anyway, this survey present the respect of the company with the people, not only customers, employees or suppliers but with the ones who would like to be part of this family. Thanks for the opportunity to participate of the survey and I hope I can follow this recruitment or new opportunities in my area of interest in the future.
Regards,
Fabio."
"I think this process is one of most complete, but once there is no limit for improvement, the system should allow the candidate know more about the limit date for finish the hiring. "
I think this process is enogh good
i think this is a good idea establish a set of filters to get the suitable candidate.
"I think they should accept people with no experience in the area. So they could develop and empower people professionally.
"
"I think they can take into account for the positions those candidates who don´t live in the city where the plant is, but are available to relocate and have strong wishes to work."
I think they are doing very well.
I think the way that Johson & Johson has a good way to recruit.
"I think the selection process is very friendly, however I would like to be able to show my skills during a face-to-face interview.

Thanks

Best Regards

"I think the selction process in J&J are clear.
I hope the opportunity to participate in these."
I think the recruitment was simple and straight forward. Maybe there should be some focus on getting to know the candidates on a more personal level through personality surveys because sometimes the candidate may be more fit for a position because his personality matches the company or the task at hand. 
"I think the recruitment process was very successful for me and my expectations.
Here is an important and very recognized company and the process was according to this perception I have."
I think the recruitment process was transparent and friendly to user so far.
"I think the recruitment process was clear, but I would have been called for an interview where I could clearly detail my skills and my professional experience. I am quite sure that my professional experience is completely in line with the requirements of recruitment."
I think the recruitment process is very well structured.
"I think the recruitment process is ok, maybe a faster comunication with the person."
I think the recruitment process could be improved by announcing in the home page of the website informations about the job vacancies available.
"I think the recruitment process at Johnson & Johnson is a differential when we are looking the general oppotunity. In this moment, I don't believe they have to change or improve something."
I think the recruiting system works very well. I do not perceive defects that I consider important so far.
I think the process would be better if the candidate would the opportunity for an interview before decline the application. 
"I think the process of choosing the candidate for the position is a bit slow, but understandable by the number of candidates who dream of working in this great company."
I think the process is very complete and adequate
"I think the process is good but too much time passes by before hearing any news about the application. For example my application to the position of Finance Manager, Global Service Latin America (1700157833W).

I have not heard from you, so I don´t know if I am still a candidate, or was I discarded as one.....nothing.

It is important to candidates to know a little more.

thank you

Carlos Velasco"
I think the process is fine the way it is designed
"I think the process is clear, and for me it's ok."
"I think the process is clear and very simple. The only thing I will improve is to make a responsive site, I´d tryed to open the link with my Iphone and I couldn´t do it. "
"I think the process is 100% reliable, maybe I should interview via skype"
I think the procedure is in good order
"I think the present process presented is well structured, however as an improvement I suggest a psychological profile test considering the technical skills are already pre-existing, for evaluation of management and decision-making issues."
"I think the J&J recruitment process seems to be good and clear until the phase that i'm currently. But, to make my means clear and help you improve it more each process, i suggest to make all recruitment seems like a business negotiation or business meeting where the participants talk about how the company would be a good fit to theirs professional life as well as the opposite instead of make like all brazilian companies do: like a interview process basically where the candidate positions like selling his services or professional life. I believe that all of us should look ourselves as a collaborator, contributor or even as a partner of each companie we work or we prospect to. We are comming to a new age of professional and companies in which all of us are consider important horizontally and vertically, no matter the position we have inside the companie.

So, that's my suggestion, i think also that all companies should feed this new mindset in its collaborators, empowering them since to be a real good fit since the recruitment process.

Thanks for this opportunity of sharing my point of view."
"I think the feedback should be improved, because I have been trying some positions and I don't know how I'm not choose even for the interview."
I think the feedback is a good way to maintain a good relationship with the candidates. 
I think the face-to-face recruitment process may be more timely for the candidate.
"I think the current process is good, so I understand that no further improvements are need for this process."
I think the company should will improve the contact with the applicant's. I didn't receive any contact.
I think the career web site would be a proper channel for the applicant to get some inside on the application status. Especially in the first stage in which is hard to determine if ones CV was considered in a specific recruitment process.
"I think the application process was simple and easy. No suggestions at the moment--except for maybe hearing back on moving forward or not in the selection process in addition to doing this survey.

Thank you. "
"I think that, Johnson & Johnson could be better in everythink that it does, incluind this recruitment process. You have budget and a  uncontestable brand. 

We Always could be better... "
I think that your process is very efficient and professionally. 
I think that you can improve your recruitment process by get a feedback to the candidates. I never kown what happend with my aplication and interview. No one answer my mails or let me know if the process was finish and another candidate takes the position. I think it's more polite to give a feedback. But everything else was good and comfortable. Thank you anyway to the oportunity.
I think that you call the applicants and know about them better.
"I think that their processes are very well structured, I just want to affirm that it is important that opportunities are offered to professionals from other cities who seek to better project, grow as professionals, and give everything in Pro the company of their dreams.


Develop my skills to another level, in one of the most important organizations in the world, lead me to be motivated to fight for this great job opportunity where I can demonstrate my attitudes and skills in Pro of joint growth, based on teamwork , Motivation and creativity.

JyJ has been, is, and will be my professional dream. I'M READY TO BE PART OF THE Johnson & Johnson FAMILY."
"I think that the recruitment process at the moment is good enough, maybe could be better do questions about the skills that could do a difference between the applicants, or do some research, on Linkdein, for example, of the skills such as leadership, teamwork, level of office or some computer program."
I think that the recruitment and selection process is very well targeted and clear
"I Think that the process the recruitment was very good. Congratulation the department of recruitment.
"
I think that the process of recruitment was really great and satisfactory.  And I'd like to remark the kindness and excellent treat that Ana Radeland gave to me in this process. 
I think that the process must have more transparency. As candidate I cannot see or understand the evolution of the process. There is no information available and the recruiter has never contacted me.
I think that the process it's extremely easy and confident between candidate and interviewer
"I think that the process is pretty interesting and it has the right aknowledge requeriments for the postion,


BR

Angel."
"I THINK THAT THE PROCESS IS APPROPRIATE, HOWEVER, J & J MUST MAINTAIN CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES"
I think that the process has been transparent and it is important to continue with the interviews to know the process of recruitment of Johnson & Johnson.
I think that the necessary information has been provided.
"I think that the most important in a recruitment process is feedback, this allows to participants, know the state of the process."
"I think that the J&J's process are very good, because the candidate always get the feedback, maybe if had a way to explain why some candidate have not been selected that process could be better."
"I think that should not be neccesary to have experience in medical product, to be consider as  candidate, I had applyed in several times and I never received the opportuny of an interview. I have a lot attitude and desire to learn, the experience is important but is not a garanty of a good work  "
I think that recruiter people have to guve an aseeri if you continue with the process or not
"I think that may be useful a first approach with human resources dept. to evaluate not only the skills and experience but also the personal profile of the candidate.

Best regards

Juan Martin , Alfonso"
"I think that Johnson could filter the registered candidates according with the areas that the company believes that they will fit perfectly. And also make a pre-selection of the candidates to a specifc opportunity, basing on Johnson data bank of registered candidates."
"I think that Johnson & Johnson should have more communication with future employer, because at this moment I don't have information about my aplication."
I think that Johndon&Johnson does the recruitment process of a good way.
i think that Jhonson n Jhonson has the necessary information about their vacants.
"I think that J&J has a great recruitment process. Thank you,

Lia"
"I think that J&J could send an email including information about the recruitment process for each position .
"
"I think that J&J could improve giving more opportunities to older people, helping us (the candidate) with a chance to show our capacity, abilities, and how committed we are.
"
I think that it¹s ok how it is.
I think that it would be good to receive detailed feedback related to the process.
"I think that it is good, but you should give the same opportunity for internal and external people"
I THINK THAT IS VERY WELL
I think that is very informal process because you need to know the candidate not just for a resume. 
"I think that is very important send a feedback positive or negative for the candidate, even this person is not choose for the work. "
I think that during the process of recruiting the company should give updates about the stages of each application.
I think that depending on my case that I live in another country the process can continue to apply the tests in the country where the candidate comes from or if you have a contact face to face use skype or other tools to perform the job interview.
"I think that communication with applicants must be improved. I applied for this position and never got a response, not even saying that I wasn't selected."
I think that better response times and maybe tests online to direct the skills of each candidate to diferent areas.
"I think that all the competencies and skills are as clear as possible, I have no complains about it, I´m just waiting and expecting the analysis of my profile and if I use for the job vacancy."
i think that all perfect ...
I think that a personal interview provides the whole accomplishment to the position requirements.
"I think that a 1:1 interview will be great to complete the profile of the candidate. Knowing the person you can see other areas that will be difficult to understand only with a paper evaluation. 
For example in my case, I not have an MBA and may be if you know me you would re evaluate the idea to hire me.

"
"I think so have a very good process to recruitment.
Regards!!  "
I think should be send a message when don't keep the position
"I think not only Johnson & Johnson plus other companies, could be more accurate in their feedbacks to the interviewees, because it generates anxiety in all who participate and when there is feedback is something generalized and superficial to all, this is not productive and serious, We need real feedback on what we need to improve and why we were not qualified for the job.
"
"I think Johnson & Jonhnson has a recruitment process as ordinary as the other companies, I've been participed in many process  and the diference among them are the especific skills requested. although I hadn't all of them, I would learn if necessary!
Thanks! "
"I think Johnson & Johnson´s recruitment process has been very clear and organized since I saw the offer aplicattion, so for this reason J&J talent acquisition has sent by e-mail every information step by step about hiring and integrating the new employee to the organization.
Congratulations for your feedback."
"I think Johnson & Johnson's human resources gives all the main informations about the role, so there's nothing missing, in my opinion.

"
I think Johnson & Johnson is doing great.
"I think Johnson & Johnson can always evolve in its recruiting process, following market trends and new role models. There is a new generation of professionals, more aware of new technologies, more connected and aware with world."
I think job opportunities should be better publicized by job sites.
"I think J&J is doing a great work. I have nothing to say, everything was very clear  and quick.

Thank you very much for the opportunity.

"
"I think J&J could show application progress, and how long each phase used to takes. Having this consideration, would be better to control the expectation, by candidate point of view.
Thank for this survey."
I think J&J can be give an oportunity to join the company.
I think it´s a good process 
I think it's pretty well implemented.
I think it's Ok. But it would be better for you to know about last experiences. 
"I think it's not J & J's problem, but it's about the market, relative to the return of jobs.
They could give a return on why they did not continue in the process."
I think it's great... I can't describe all the recruitment process because it's my first experience
I think it's good the way it is :)
I think it's a very good platform and friendly.
I think it's a good work yet and i have to say it's good when we have a feedback about our application. 
I think it would be better for a personal interview
"I think it was pretty much well done, intuitive and easy to complete, I hope you guys can keep doing this kind of great job. "
"I think it was an excellent process. I consider that it's important to show the applicants what is the state of their process, specially when it is over."
I think it is very clear and I had no problems with it
"I think it is really good, congratulations!"
I think it is pretty well designed
I think it is ok. Linkedin is nowadays the best way to recruit and this survey is also concise and well-structured.
"I think it is great...it's clear the points.
Johnson & Johnson is a wonderful and big business...that need the better people to work with them"
I think it is great the way it is right now .
I think it is a very good process and reliable methodology. Congratulations!
I think it is a very friendly process.
"I think it could be better if a survey like this you can participe just at the end of a job application or when you enter your data in the website of J&J.
"
"I think is very fast  and easy process, cut be have more language option will be better and easy for more peoples.

best regards 

Mayra Sanchez"
I think is perfect .
I think is important to keep the candidates informed about the process.
I think is a very good recruiment process and I thank you for your email and attention. I hope to be part of your team and contribute to the company growth.
I think is a efficiently recruitment process 
I think in the exercise of the profession is when you notice the means that could be. 
"I think in a personal interwiew, digital way (skype) can be an added value for interviews. This gives a friendly and closer treatment with the interviewed, and allows him to get to know the person, rather than his work achievements."
"I think improving a login ID for candidates with tine frame status of jobs and RH process would be helpful for employee candidates and will provide more encouragement and hope. 
Thank you for this opportunity!"
I think I would include personal attention. Maybe a call could be a good idea. Just to try to give some formality.
I think face-to-face interviews with postulants
I think each and every company has unique way of recruitment but as a suggestion i would i like to mention the simple submission of resume would be their if no relevant job openings are available. 
"I think could be better improve the website and make easily to find the propoerly link to start the recruitment process.
After make the first input of my resume, i received an email that didn't works and than some person from J&J supported me on this, actually super kind and very committed  on help me and than I could finish. "
I think correct and perfect procedure
"I think by having a personal interview or by phone call, before sending a mail saying that you are not consider to continue in the process. because this help for us the people that area applying for the job to have a feedback, and this can help us to improve some skills por the next chance."
"I think better the first time contact to the aspirant and make this question in the first interview, for this time i only received from the johson&johnson this email with this requirement, I hope contact me and move forward with the interview
rgds
"
I think all the process was organized and the interviews well coordinated. Recruiter and Hiring Team were clear and direct. 
"i think  peoples that have a good record in the Co in the past, but for some reason leave, need to have a better hándicap in the recruitment process 
I have the sensation that today, that these is not HR, is just complete a position."
"I thing that the selection process was very interesting, the people of human talent were very kind; there was constant communication and the information was very clear.

"
I thing is good
"I suppose in the first instance the process would be correct. Personally, I would like to be contacted by recruiting staff or the technical area in order to be able to tell them about my experiences and also to answer any doubts they may have about me.

I await contact
Thank you very much!"
"I suggest to schedule a interview in order to present myself and explain better about my skills, background and competences.
Please let me know if it is viable for you. My best regards,
MARIA DO CARMO ALTENFELDER SILVA"
I suggest that RH give a feedback about the status ou answer of the employment proposal.
"I suggest that J&J could inform the candidates if the submitted application is still under consideration, selected or not giving more updates about the process."
"I suggest share the progress or state of process, let candidate know how many candidates are involved, how long time it will takes.
Reserve the strategy information for the company, but is important to release the information can help the person to mature and in indirect way improve the quality of process.
"
"I submitted my CV via the recruitment site but never received any communication or invitation to interview, nor any rejection letter. 

I did receive three emails asking for feedback on the process, so here we are."
I strong believe that J&J could consider candidates from another process that stayed until the end of the process. Like me.
I still haven't received any feedback on my application. I would like to know my status in the process. 
"I sent my resume to the position and immediately, almost 10 minutes later, I've received an answer back informing my application would not be considered.
My skills are aligned with the position requirements and I heard about this position through a friend of mine, who is Manager at J&J and invited me to apply.
So why my resume was not even submitted to the recruitment process?
"
I sent my application almost 2 months ago and never heard anything so I haven't had the best experience with J&J.
"I send my curriculum for a job I consider I was the perfect fit almost a month ago. As per now I haven’t received any feedback on the process. 
I’m still waiting for a communication from your part.

Thanks.
"
"I see the recruitment process with good organization, clear and straight to the goal."
"I see an opportunity on keeping in touch, I reckon there would be to many applications but I think people appreciate when the company takes 1 minute of its time to inform the applicants if they are still in the process or even if they don't."
I saw this job posting first in linkedin. I think that it should appear first inside the company. Also it would be great to have a feedback from RRHH saying that they have received correctly the information you submitted in the web for this job posting.
"I recommend most contact with the candidates;  the contact would include interview by Skype for example.

Kind regards,

"I recently participated in a process (which was later suspended - São Paulo unit) which I was very well served. I had the opportunity to introduce myself professionally and this helped a lot the alignment between the company and me.
I believe the current recruitment process is very good."
"I received no information from J&J, nor even a call about the process.  It was a little disapointed and frustrating I was very eager to work with the company.
Thank you for the opportunity and looking forward to hearing from you.

"I received a call from de Talent acquisition Specialist Karen Novaes and she explained the job detailed. I am very motivated for the role but because of my years of experience  she said i can't go foward the recruitment process.
To improve the recruitment process i think Johnson & Johnson should flexibilize. I just need one chance to prove how engaged and motivated i am. One of my skills is be adaptive and resilient. I really know i can do a good job independet of my greater time of formation.
Thanks"
"I really want to be part of the company. I have many skills and all of them are reported in the job profile.
I need an opportunity and I hope you will allow me to show you my professional qualities."
"I really think Johnson & Johnson can give more Feedbacks to the candidates during the recruitment process.
"
"I really don't know, because I've never participated in Johnson & Johnson recruitment process."
"I really don't know if there is something to improve. Even though I've never been selected, I think it is a well done recruitment process."
"I REALLY apreciate the J&J reicrutment process... I could notice a strong sense of responsability and professionalism from HR talent aquision in give me all information needed, feedback and develop the interview. The only improvement I can see is on SJC reception, would be better offer a room to wait for the interview, the sun was very hard and I had a headache during the interview. "
"I prefer to apply opportunity via linked in because the application process is so easier and my background is so clear.
And weak point of current procedure is most part of procedure repeat for each job application.

Good luck."
I personally prefer people contacting me but i understand these are these procedures usted.
"I only completed my application in order to be in your data base, not a specific post"
"I never received feedback from the process.
Although I have an excellent experience in the position, extensive professional training, good human quality, I am well above average that other in all aspects (human and technical) and I am aligned with your principles and corporate values I was never taken into consideration for their process of selection, I never knew if it was suspended or what happened. I am very disappointed to have applied to the position requested by you."
"I never received a call/email about the process, it would have been interesting to hear from you, but as of this day I hadn't heard from you. I don't even know if I was being considered for the position. I guess a better communication could help. "
"I never had any interview with company, only submitted my CV."
I never get approach from any executive to advance in the process. I do not know why you did not contact me. I would like to know what are my opportunities to become a part of the team. 
I never did a selective process at Johnson
I need to improve my skylls in terms of process development and I think this is a great opportunity for that.
I need a job in Johnson & Johnson
"I love johnson, I find it an excellent company with virtuous values ​​and an excellent brand reputation in the market. For this reason, I do not miss the opportunity to try to apply to their job offers, when I see that I have the skills and experience necessary for it.
It is complex, perhaps, to be supremely explicit in the calls and perhaps in some cases they are short.
Anyway, I apologize, because it is my interest to be part of your company.

Best regard,

Lizardo Diaz."
"I liked the recruitment process, and I don't have claims about that, but I think that  the deadlines and feedback received are very important."
"I liked the feedback, because a lot of companies don't do this. It shows the commitment of Johnson & Johnson with the candidate and how serious is the recruitment team."
"I like the recruitment process because is pretty simple and doesn't take to much time to complete the application. 

My advice would be to create open questions like this about the jobs to get to know a little more about the candidate before an interview . 

"
"I like the recruitment  process that you have, I didn't have problems with it."
"I like the process, very user friendly."
"I know it is not easy to do what I will write, but when someone is not the right candidate for the position, it would be good to know why, the reasons for that. J&J is one of really few companies that use to give a feedback (if the CV whas selected or not for the next steps of the process), but with no reason. Thanks"
"I just want to have an interview opportunity.I worked for J&J from 2005 to 2007 (Cordis) like Sr Process Engineer at Technical Operations (NPD Group). I have wide experience on Medical Devices and J&J Procedures since Product Definition-Characterization to Production Process and Product Launch. I was developed by J&J at Design Control too.
Thanl you."
I just wanna get a opportunity to be part of a selective process.
"I initially made my registration for the smartphone, I had no difficulties, so the tool is accurate even in this type of device, and I confess that it was very good for me to train my English, which I do not use daily in my current job, but which study For over 5 years. I am very willing to join this reputed company, although I do not have experience in this field, I am very familiar with sales, customer service, so I hope that the selection process takes into account my professional experience, because I have much to commit. Thank you,"
I hope to receive feedback at least within a week upon application to cut the waiting process.
"I hope that they focus more on resume more than online applications at least to give chance for applicants to show them experiences and skills .

"
I hope that Johnson & Johnson contact me to provide information about the stats of the process.
"I highly recommend to the recruitment team really verify the job applications received, I was not take in consideration for the position, and I do considered my self a qualified and experienced person that fits to the profile requirements for the position, I do have about 10 years experience in the position and I handle all the quality tools required for the position, eventhough the recruiter did not considered me for interviews.

Sincerly!

"I haven´t received any comunication to know if the process continue o no. Now I suppoused that  you choose another person but I think you should give feedback to your candidates.
I am sure I really have the experience for this position but I never received a comunication or any evaluation."
I haven´t finished this process but overall the recruitment process is very good and smooth and all people were very kind.
"I haven´t been contact since my application. I think it is important to give some feedback and do some follow up on candidates.
Otherwise, I find excellent recruiting practices.

I also want to reiterate my special interest and motivation on becoming part of J&J. I've always had the best impression on the company's culture and practices!"
"I haven't received any feedback, but I know it's too soon. So, I don't know yet if I haven't received it because it's not the time yet or if it's because you don't use to send it. In that last case, it's always better for the candidate to know why is rejected instead of staying waiting for an answer. But I repeat, in this case I know it's too soon to know it. The plataform is perfect. "
"I haven't received any contact about this vacancy process, it would be nice to receive an e-mail saying about its status. 
I'm looking forward to apply for another opportunity.

"I have nothing to declare, because the selection process is very important to know the capabilities of the candidate."
"I have nothing to complain about about johnson & Johnson's selective processes, clear job description and feedback on processes."
i have not started the process yet.
"I have not started a formal recruitment process, so far I just applied to the job"
I have not identified improvement opportunities
"I have not heard about if the recruiment process move on or not.
I expected to receivea message in case I have not selected to take part in the process."
"I have not finished the process yet. I do not think I can say anything for the moment.
I hope I have helped.

I have not been interviewed by the recruitment department
I have not been contacted from the recruiters thus I couldn't mention any particular improvements in the process. 
"I have not been contacted from JNJ to know further steps in the process, or if my profile did not accomplish the expectations for the requested position."
"I have no recommendations, the process was very good."
I have no comments so far.
"I have no comments on this.

Your process is very much in order."
I have no clue why my application was rejected. I am left with assumptions. J&J could do give some kind of feedback.
I have interviewed with 2 different HR personal. After these interviews I followed up with them and they gave me opposite information about if I am still considered for the position. It seemed a little disorganized and I am lost if I am still in the run for the position or not
"I have experience in Logistics, Supply Chain, Stock Control for four year in international business.
I would like work this business a lot, help and to add value as far as possible."
"I have experience and I believe that I have capability to work in J&J. Unfortunately I never had opportunity.

"I have been the chance to participate to the major recruiting process of J&J, including the participation in the Networking event to introduce the new share service located in Bogotá - Colombia, also J&J recruiters contact me constantly and are very attentive with me.

Really in comparison with other experiences who I had in the Colombian market, I consider that J&J have one of the best recruiting processes, opportunities to improve the process should there are, but in my opinion only missing enjoy to work in Johnson & Johnson"
"I have been applying since 2015 for almost all vacancies offered by J&J related to Quality. My skills always are matched with job role description. I believe that HR and Quality core area shoud give more chances to demonstrate abilities to be part of J&J staff.

"I have applied several times through Johnson & Johnson careers during the past months. The application process is really fine and clear. Although, once the application is filled, you feel a little lost about how the future of it would be. Once, i was contacted by human resources with a questionnaire, with no further reply, and some others i did not get the automatic message about the non selection. I understand the high volume of applications that you may receive daily and the great challenge that it represents, nevertheless, it sometimes makes you perceive the process too impersonal and a kind of a lottery. Perhaps, specifying the due date of the position to be filled, or giving some insights about tentative dates for interviews, tests, and how the process may carry on, could clear some perspectives to applicants."
I have applied many times to the J&J job positions and the feedback about the reason to be not considered on recruitment process of the company is really  poor. Mechanical and automatic.  
I have applied many times but I have not been contacted. I worked for J&J by 2 years from 2005-2007 at Cordis de Mexico. I was developed by J&J since New Product-Process Development to Production Validations-Release Product-Process. I would like to have the opportunity to have Interviews again and be able to work at J&J again I recognize J&J like very strong company and I was proud when I was working there.
"I have access only up to this fase of the recruitment process and It´s ok for me, so far.

Note: I don´t know why, but it´s the second time I answer this survey.

i have 20 years in J&J and the pocess is good for my is not problem
"I had enough great examples from J&J about how to treat candidates during the selection process phases. So, keep doing the good job. Probably the only thing I would add is about the possibility of sending a customized reason related to the why the candidate did not make a progress. "
"I had an outstanding experience. Submission of CV, 5 days later had the first interview and 3 days later had the second interview."
"I had a great experience with my recruitment process, my first interview was with Nathalia Athia and we had a awesome conversation, she explains everything about the open position, as well as, J&J expatiation regarding the candidates  and than as a second step I met Leonardo, and again, I can felt the passion to be part of J&J family coming for both.

I just want say thank you very much indeed for this opportunity and hopefully I can be part of J&J family."
I guess the process is very clear in everything until now.
I guess nothing. I wasn't accepted 
"I guess I'll just say to keep applicants with clear and fast communication, once we're all experiencing a harsh mismatch between applicants and job offerings."
"I gues the is te better for J&J is let all the job opportunity in the correct place, because there are many jobs that don´t see in portuguese."
I guees by an interview
"I got some difficulties to access the position because the site should be choose as English version and I was using a portugueese one and there's no informations about it only after contact a friend who works at J&J and he contacted the R&H it was possible to access the position on the site.

"I found it simple, when they request to fill the format that they send by mail, and one does, they should answer this, at least saying that they received the mail."
"I felt the lack of more personal contact or feedback through a call from a recruiter, for example."
"I feel that a personal approach is essential to a perfect acquisition in this area, as an interview, for example. In order to understand goals and expose your mission and values toward the role needed. "

I don't think there is anything to improve the recruitment process.
"I don't see major points right now. As mentioned, web site is very intuitive and the recruiter has been kind too. More to come with the next steps in the process. Happy so far!"
"I don't see a clear improvement area, all interviews where really different which enriched the process because you are able to see several perspectives of the vacancy"

One factor that might help to accurate the best talent is hiring based on the following statement:   ""You do not earn what you deserve but what you negotiate.""  This could be even more relevant when you are hiring talent for commercial and procurement fields, that can demonstrate how strong are you in negotiations.    "
I do not see improvement needs in the process.

I didnt received any feedback
I didnt received any contract fro HR.
I didnt receive a feedback about the recruitment process.
"I didnt hear nothing after I submitted my resume until now.
I applied recently to other position and is the same situation.
I think you should give feedback on what is missing on the candidate profile to fit the position, because without a notification on what happened, it seems to me that no one is considering your submission application, and that something is failing in your recruitment process, and also, could be considered a discourtesy that makes you lose the interest in wanting to work in J&J
"
I didn't receive any return since the application - this is the first contact since then. Perhaps to provide a reply would be good (even if negative).
"I didn't receive any contact since I applied for the position.
I found strange to receive a feedback survey about recruitment process without speaking with someone from the company"
"I didn't receive any contact from Johnson & Johnson about my application. Not even an email informing that I was not selected for interviews.
It'd a dream working at Johnson & Johnson, but as I said I didn't get any update about my application.
I wish I could receive any information why I didn't fit for the role."
"I didn't receive a call, email or something else saying yes or no.  Maybe that will improve your process."

Thank you very much for this opportunity!"
I could include: What yours expectatives about the job and which especific habilities are required to qualify.
I consider very useful communicate  when the position is not available anymore.
"I consider the recruitment process is very clear, but I would like to know about application progress .  

"
I consider the current process established by the company correctly and with the very clear and detailed information..
I consider that you must communicate to the applicant the reasons why he was not hired to know what skills or abilities he should develop
"I consider that the recruitment process was carried out in an excellent way, rather than a form of improvement, I urge you to follow this process as attentively as now for future recruitment."
I consider that it is a strong process that goes according to the needs of the company
"I consider that is very important a direct contact, in this technological process you can not have a 100% real concept about the candidates.

"
I consider that a key aspect in recruiting is letting know the candidate the status of the process. This could be managed with IT solutions and could be an opportunity for improvement for J&J.
I consider one of the best companies to work for. I am absolutely sure that I am looking for the right path for my professional and personal development.
I consider J&J recruitment process is very accurate. 
"I consider it a good process, and i hope for a meeting with you asap and i am very excited for your interest in me for your marketing position and i would like to show you my experience in marketing and also in sales.
"
"I consider clear and effective the process that has been carried out so far. One suggestion you can add is to enter interviews through a conference, which can contribute to the speed of the selection process as it will optimize the time of recruiters and candidates.

Respectfully,

Roberta Cunha."
"I completely agree with the process, because since i arrived to Argentina, i have noticed that many companies use Consulting Agencies to recruit, and for me it is so much better when the own company make the whole process"
I can´t evaluaete.
I can`t evaluate in a good way
I can't thin rigth now. but de comunication with de candidates seems good to me.
"I can't say anything about this, it is my first recruitment process at Johnson & Johnson"
I can not answer this question because I have not yet participated in any process
I can no longer log in to the careers page and see all the jobs I applied for.

I belive that it should improve the response times in the recruitment process in such a way to give a better folow up in each postulation.
I believe you have a good process
"I believe with the company must to talk with the candidata, try to find the link between the company and the candidata."
"I believe with a conversation with the candidates its a really great thing. We feel so good when the someone from the company call to us. And the company can feel the vibe, what expectation from the candidate.

Thank you for ask me.

"I believe this process is one of the best ways to reclute personnel, personality I was very confortable with this process."
I believe there are still some areas for improvement on the feedback process. 
I believe the way is right and I'm waiting for an opportunity if I work.
I believe the currently recruitment process Johnson & Johnson has is a good and does not need any improvement. 
I believe the company keep clear communication and giving proper feedback to the candidate related to the recruitment process.
I believe the company is on the right track.
"I believe the company has an excellent reputation with regard to recruitment processes, so the company will do your best so that the process is conducted in the best possible way."
I believe that to improvethe recruitment process some of the questions should be directed to the knowledge of the role as well as some personal items that J&J can have for further considerations. For the other informations is quite ok.
"I believe that through behavioral testing and skills can help in the process and bring better results.
"
I believe that this way practice is good.
"I believe that the selection process of the J&J is perfectly clear, might disclose more clearly on social networks such as LINKEDIN."
I believe that the recruitment process is well structured
"I believe that the recruitment process is really good, I can't think in any improvements."
I believe that the recruitment process is quite complete and simple to follow and fill it.
"I believe that the hiring process is more mechanical than anything. Not only J&J but employers rely on computers to pre-select candidates. Also, it seems as if employers talk a great game regarding wanting a person who is trainable and possesses great soft skills. In reality, I personally feel as if soft skills are not valued as they should. However, J&J have empirical data has reveals precise results. My contribution here is merely subjective based on my personal experience with the application process."
"I believe that Jonson & Johnson already has a great selection process, with my experience in other selections, i can confidently say that this is a very well structured one.
"
i believe that J&J can be related whit the possible worker with oral interview and to kwow your abilities 
"I believe that in this first moment this small questionnaire of the application process  is important. In later stages, professional profile testing could make the process more efficient."
"I BELIEVE THAT I DO NOT CONCLUDE MY CAREER IN J&J, I HAVE WORKED IN THIS CIA FOR 6 YEARS, BUT I BELIEVE THAT I CAN CONTRIBUTE TO SKINCARE(Neutrogena, ROC and Clean & Clear) VERY MUCH. I AM SURE THAT THE LOVE I HAVE FOR THIS COMPANY WILL BE THE GREATEST COMPETENCE TO BE CONTRACTED.

I believe that a favorable or unfavorable feedback for the candidate would be very good.
"I believe J&J has a well established recruitment process in many aspects and one area that can be improved is the ""feedback"" . I wish I could receive faster and more specific feedback. "
"I believe J&J could provide additional feedback on the stages of the recruitment process, such as:

        * Gathering Resumes & CV´s
        * Resume Final Selection
        * Phone Interviews (Quick check)
        * Face to Face Interviews
        * Process Finalization
        * Candidates notifications (Yes or No)


Like to put 4 to 5 stages, nothing more detailed, i think if you do that you will provide visibility to all the candidates and internal clientes , will generate confidence and good will and will be a new gold standard process...

J&J is a great company, I´d love to work there.

Whishing all the best in this survey and in your company and growth plans.

"I believe its fair to inform (as soon as possible) when a candidate is no longer considered for the position. 

May adding a graphical message (icon, progress bar, etc) that represents the situation of the candidate related to that job offer."
"I believe it's a good process and despite all participants receive their feedback on the progress of the process it would be good if all applicants could have the opportunity to fill a competence questionary or on line assessment after a cv review. 
Warm regards, DANIEL. "
I believe is a very good pricess 
"I believe in nothing. I really enjoyed being referred and never saw a process where there is a coach, where we can ask questions and be supported to believe, to move on. 
Congratulations!"
I believe giving more opportunities to meet candidates personally in interviews. 
I believe everything is well conducted
"I believe can be done more presencial  interviews . One can lose a good candidate, without the chance of him exposing his skills and willingness to be a member of Johnson."
"I beleive that J&J could reach out to candidates sooner, if the resume fits the profile.  I have received this survey before any other contact.  I hope to be in touch soon!  Thanks for the opportunity. "
I beieve J & J is a very good company 
I appreciate the opportunity to participate of the process with Johnson & Johnson. 
"I apply to this offer because description of the role to the position Cientifico Jr (1700160343W) was really interesting and my experience is relationed with this position and learning process is constant. Right now, in this point of process  I think that recruitment process should include a personal interview.

Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the process. I will be attentive.

See you soon!"
"I applied, I heard back from the recruiting agent, I answered and provided all that was required and never heard back from her. It showed they didn't care about me  at all."
"I applied two weeks ago, but I didn't receive any communication yet. I think that it's better if the candidates receive some communication about the status of recruiting process."
"I applied to this position a week ago and additional to the confirmation mail I have not had any other type of contact. I would expect to receive further communication about my continuity or not in the process at least 15 days after I applied for the position.

Thank you for request my feedback on this application process. "
"I applied through linkedInn, I know that a lot of people had applied for the job too so I would like to have some visibility about the entire process (i.e. how long does it take the whole process, after how many days I might get a feedback whether I will have an interview or I was disqualified, etc.)"
"I applied through Linkedin.  But the certificate part at Linkedin was not incorporate at J&J application system.  I am CPIM (APICS), it is an important requisition for this position but , it was not included at J&J application system.
Then, I tried to re apply to this position to incorporate the CPIM information. It was not possible.
"
I applied more than a month ago and I did not receive any notification about the recruitment process.
I Applied in the past to other positions and I Didnt recieve any notification about thriller process. It will be good to let the persons know about what is going on with the process.
"I applied for the position, received a contact from HR (Thais Mascarin), she scheduled a call, but never attended. To certify that everything was ok, I replied by e-mail asking if something happened but until this moment no answer was given. 

We all know that setback, but not answering the emails is very unprofessional.

"I applied for a position in my area of expertise however I was rejected without a clear reason, this is not a win-win situation for all of us, I did not even have the chance to be interviewed in order to clear any doubts, it seems there is a fast scan selection process which can put a smoke curtain between J&J and the candidates."

"I applied for a job vacancy in Brazil, and at first the description was in portuguese, bu when you open the link to apply, all the informations are in english, but in the job prescription there is no information about that, and is not a requirement for the job applient to have a fluent english. Maybe you should post the job opportunity in English, if is a mandatory knowledge for the appliants that way just the people who really know english could applied, and it will be another way to receive a particular kind of candidates with a specific hability."
"I applied and received no feedback from the recruitment itself, but received three e-mails to answer this research and questions, even though my only contact with Johnson & Johnson, unfortunately, was myself only interacting with the company website application. 
Candidates should be treated with respect for the time they took applying and considering the company to be his first/second home and a minimum feedback even though negative. I strongly felt Johnson & Johnson's position would be a good fit with my skills and experience, I certainly would have added value to the team. "
"I am very glad with J&J recruitment process, i was very impressed how the HR recruiter(Ferraz, Jonathan) really cared about the process and would call me after the inverview to find out how was it. "
"I am trying to work at J&J and I applied for some jobs along this year. but I never was considered nor interviewed. I heard from inside source that the big issue is my age, that J&J is just hiring till 35-40 years old.  I don´t know if it is true, but the fact is in spite of all my knowledge and how much value I can add to the company I never was interviewed by HR.  I know that My name was indicated for more than one person in the marketing area, but nothing happened. It is a pit. "
"I am sure JNJ has the opportunity to choose among very talented applicants, but I never get invited to an interview, even though I have 10+ years of Finance experience in a global corporation, I hold an MBA from The University of Chicago, so that I am also a very talented applicant for the positions I am applying. 
I believe the reason why I don't even get an opportunity to interview is that I come from a very different industry, and the talent acquisition person, who is typically a junior person, does not put enough weight in the interest I have for the job and passion that I would bring to it. 
If I had the opportunity to interview with a senior Finance person, e.g. CFO, I am sure I can convince that I can transition smoothly into healthcare which is my professional aspiration.
So my point is that the screening of candidates is also a very important stage and by delegating to a junion talent acquisition person, JNJ might be losing strong candidates. "
"I am satisfy with the process. Actually, this was the easiest one bacause each part of it is very good explained."
I am satisfied with the information provided to the candidates. They were very clear and objective.
"I am not sure. I did't participate of a face to face meeting to be sure how good is the process.

But I would like to sugest that this questionaire should be done in the moment of the application, cause, nowadays, I am doing a lot of application in different companies, so I don´t remember the exactly application of J&J. So, it is better if you do this survey in the moment of true (during the application, or after a face to face interview).

Regards,

Claudio"
I am not sure in which phase of the recruitment process you are and still have not received feedback regarding my application. I think it will be good to communicate if the candidate still has a chance on the recruitment process or if it is closed and also to communicate it. 
I am not sure if this process needs improvement at this initial stage. The Ideal would be receiving a brief note positioning if you are still being considered on the process or not. Probably you have this info on the portal.
"I am not sure if the process has already finished, I did not recieve any information about that."
I am grateful for the opportunity of new challenges.
"I am completing this survey, but I did not exactly understand its purpose. I just submitt my resume to the position, however, I was not contact for any person from J&J regarding my submission or if I will be consider as a candidate. I do not see a point in answer a survey, considering that I am not currently a part of the seletion process..."
I am agree with your process
"I  would like to have a company up close, have participated in the selective process within the company. This would motivate me to improve every day to one day be part of the team"
"HR talent needs to find talent, not to exchange staff from other companies."
"However, I ws never called for an interview none informed that my aplication was being reviewed. "
"How favorably do you view Johnson & Johnson?
Hiring me, I know I can add knowledge and values WITH COMMITMENT, FLEXIBILITY, ORGANIZATION, PLANNING, TEAMWORK AND ACTION."
"How can you evaluate and discard a fully qualified candidate just by the resume. As an accomplished candidate remain the perception of age as a negative factor instead of a strength as a candidate that will add value,"
"Hola

Espero que Johnson and Johnson no reclute personas solo a recomendados, o de prioridad a estos.

"Hoje com tanta mordenidade, acho q melhor contato seria pessoalmente e nao virtualmente, e nos q temos deficiencias, talvez esse metodo on line, internet, etc.. nao seja tao comodo para nos, pois existe varios tipos de deficiencia e que talvez o deficiente ñ consiga responder esses questionarios.

"Hi! first of all thanks for hearing the applicants. I think that your page is having some problems for job finding. First of all, when I applied, and after I was recommended, I didn't find again the offer that I applied to. Secondly, if the page is open from a smartphone, it is really hard to use; this, I suppose, is due the page is made for a pc user and not for the smartphone user. This are the only two points I would remark for this phase of the process, but all the rest is really good. ah, also the specifications of the position are not well given, that could also have an improvement. 

Hope that who is reading this have a nice day!"
"Hi!

As you already know, my name is Isaac Jaldin.
I believe that a personal interview makes the recruitment process more helpful for the company due to sometimes the candidate cannot express how value has he or she for the position. An interview reveals more skills in the candidate you can appreciate than just reading a resume.

Regards!"
"Hi Talent Acquisition Team,

It would be fantastic that the platform can notify you with matiching options between your experience and skills and the opened positions inside the company.
Because sucess of employees and employers happens when talent meets the opportunity.

Thank you very much.

Paloma Aranzazu"
"Hi everyone and thank you so much willing to hear my opinion.

From my perspective I can't see any significant improvement opportunity. I can only regret that I did not have a chance for a face to face interview because I really think I would have the means and all motivation in the world to bring a lot of value to J&J. But that's only my perspective. I have no visibility of the other candidate's qualifications or other factors possibly impacting in this talent acquisition. I'll only keep on looking forward another opportunity and keep on wishing all the best to J&J team.

Hasta el momento no considero ningún aspecto a mejorar en el proceso.
Hasta ahora para mi el proceso ha sido bueno.
"Hace poco tiempo tuve una entrevista para Pfizer, mediante una plataforma llamada HereViu, el cuál me pareció un buen sistema, ya que beneficia tanto a la empresa, por una cuestión de costos, como también al postulante ya que no es necesario trasladarse en una primera instancia."
"Hã um tempo atrás creio que 2015 a Jhonson me chamou para uma entrevista. Utilizou como competência espelho uma pessoa deficiente visual, utilizou da simpatia diretamente da mesma para depois dar o feedback para o RH. 
Porém em termos éticos e profissionais creio que nunca se deve aceitar uma pessoa logo de primeira pelo tato e voz, o ser humano vai além disso.
A ultima empresa que estive trabalhando não olhou personalidade mas sim caráter, trabalhei por um ano nessa ultima Industria, porém infelizmente tive de sair por melhor qualidade de vida, como trajeto empresa casa, melhor salário e menos cobrança. Embora tenha realizado minha função internamente com sucesso, tanto que algumas pessoas me consideram até hoje e não tinham motivo para sair, porém como disse acima, optei pela qualidade de vida, então saí deixando ótimas lembranças.
Tenho por hábito ter uma marca registrada de conquistar as pessoas com o tempo, assim consigo fazer o melhor na minha função.

GROWING WITHIN THE COMPANY
Greater interaction with applicants
Greater contact with the applicant via mail
"Good night first, i think one way to make the process more fluid could be that the human resources chief call the candidates or at least email them to know if you have the potential to occupy the job. Anyway thanx. 
J.N."
"Good morning. As per your request and being a pleasure for me, I roughly suggest the following:

1.- Besides the profile description, and depending upon the position, the recruitment process should have pictures or even animated videos of what should be the functions of the newcomers. I f for example, to hire an engineer , there should be a mechanism to virtual visit the production line down in the shop, so internalize if further newcomer identify him or herself with the process, equipments, and even philosophy of working.

2.- Besides the Curriculum Vitae, and in order to hasten the process, there must be a JOHNSON PATTERN APPLICATION FORM (JPAF) at Johnson’s web site, for the applicants to fill up and when received, should be compared quickly with the ideally cooperator pattern (FCP) the users (internal clients) have already defined, to verify if further incumbent match properly. It is recommended the JPAF has a matrix of values to be compared accordingly. 

Remarks: It is recommended the matrix shall have the maximum ponderable points to match the Johnson’s company values.  

3.- The process of a primary selection, shall be statically pre-defined, so once the first sample is grouped, under a conscientiousness process, human resources analyst, should select a minimum candidates to interview.

4.-First interview should be make through a web cam under skype, whatsup, or any other mechanism . The first interview does not reject, but would be a warning for the further candidate to a formal personal interview.

5.-Personal interview should be a meeting with the further internal Clients, where the incumbent facing a real problem or typical problems the users want the newcomer solve, offer solutions and precise methods to daily help to improve such a problem.

6.- The final selection shall be a matter of a ponderable consensus, as a deliberating process.

7.- The process herein described as a procedure in its general aspects, shall be revised periodically to be improved, according to the feedback received from previous positions and results obtained under this method of hiring the best candidates to The Johnson Company. 

The herein suggestions have been proposed by Jorge Pérez, as a request from Johnson Company, as a request to continuously improve the Hiring Process.

"
"Good morning, the selection process seems good, they give all the bases to know the activities of the job to which you are applying, what I do not think is correct is that there is an interaction with the applicant, simply a programmed email is the Which tells you that you did not pass the first review, I consider that many people have the skills and abilities to take a step forward in a job in postulation, I consider that many talents are lost without intending to at least listen and know their Expectations, the first impression should not be information that is filled in a form,

Thank you,"
"Good Morning!
The institution is congratulated by the selection process.
I have nothing to add."
Good Job
Good job
"Good evening, I think that in order to improve the selection process, you could ask for more information about the experience of each candidate and also value the desire to belong to the company.
Thank you"
"Good day...
I believe that the process must be complete, always. I mean that the candidates need to receive an answer from the company that he is applying, even if the response is negative.
A honest response from the companies reflects its real values. It is too much common to hear at the market that ""the human capital is the major asset that the company has"" , so if it is a real value to the companies they must accomplish this value.
This is a free thinking from myself based in several exemples that I have seen over the years.
Many thanks for this opportunity.

Have a good day!"

For now.is perfect! Congratulations
For now the process is ok.
For now I have no comments.
For my is all perfect.
"For me, the recruitment process was perfect till now. "
For me was very clear and according with the position. Probably it is a little bit longer in terms of time.
"For me was an excellent experience to be interviewed by Jacqueline Girón, a very profesional collaborator. If all personal inside J&J are similar as she, you can be sure to have a very happy company!. The process with her is developing in time and form. I want to congratulate her job. "
For me the process is complete
For me the hiring process of the manpower is quite long because J&J need to filter all the applicants. However a phone interview will help to preliminary discuss the background of the applicants before the personal interview. Email confirmation from time to time could also help advise the people the they are not forgotten on the selection process.
For me it's ok
For me it would be nice to receive a feedback from recruitment in the end of the process. 
For me it was very good. I have just applied through internet. 
"For me it is perfect, I would not like change nothing."
"For me
so far I have understanded all skills and competences need to apply to job posting. 
maybe to improve, it can be mentioned about the stages of the selection process.

"
"For leaderships positions, when a senior leader apply, you should, at least hear from him/her in an interview and do not refuse based on the application form and curriculum (resumé)."
"For Johnson & Johnson to improve their recruitment process, Human resource must give more considerable or chance in hiring for those applicant in terms of performance and action job role in the company. Not only just for favorable for the human resource team because of the way the applicant deliver the answer toward the recruitment question. Some applicant may give the human resource interview the best answer to the job question but when it come to the performance job role it does not reach the expectation. I believe in the saying that ""THE ACTION SPEAKS LOUDER THAN WORDS"" motto"
"For all internal J&J emplyees, at least call for interview. I have received a lot of ""denays"" without having any conversation with HR."
Follow up with candidates quicker. That includes positive & negative responses.
"Foi ótimo terem enviado um retorno, já que a maioria das empresas não fazem isso, dar.mais oportunidades pra brasileiros que tem vontade de construir uma nova carreira."
Focus on skills more than studies or years of experience. An on-line writing interview or DISC evaluation previous to start a process could save time to J&J and candidate.
"First. Make a review of know how much to offer the employee. 
Second. Make interviews more feasible and comfortable 
Third. Use a real situation or problem to prove skills, knowledge and behaviour of the employee"
"First of all I would like to thanks J&J for the opportunity to be part of this process.
In my opinion, this  stage of the process (Application) had been crystal clear, the data and role description are fully complete, exept the location scenario (Brazil, Colombia and Mexico) but I understand this poit will be clarify in a second round.

Everybody involved on the process was very professional. Not much to add on that.
"Every company asks their candidates to complete a different and personal CV online. For me the eficient and fastest way is allowing candidates to send their own and creative CV and sharing their LinkedIn profile. A call should help too, and finally but yet  most important a personal interview."
"Even more visibility on process steps, its contents, and estimated finishing time."
EVALUATE THE CURRICULUM WITH MASTER AND PÓS DOC
Evaluate the candidate with the help of other people and use the power of social networks to advertise the J&J positions and attract talent.
"Eu gostaria de ter uma oportunidade de ser entrevistado ao mesmo tempo, mesmo tendo o perfil para uma vaga, nunca sou chamado."
"Estou achando prático o processo de recrutamento da Johnson & Johnson, até o momento não vejo necessidade de melhorias, o fato da entrevista ser realizada por videoconferência facilita  para os candidatos, pois não são todos que possuem acesso fácil e disponibilidade imediata para estar realizando a entrevista no local físico solicitado pela empresa. "
"Estimo que todas las cosas son perfectibles, probablemente no se llegue a la excelencia, pero si la buscamos, la pensamos, estamos muy cerca de alcanzar el objetivo, a mi juicio, no puedo emitir opinión por no conocerlo más profundamente, pero en lo que a mí respecta, no encuentro nada para mejorar, salvo, tal vez, aquellos que no tenemos un dominio completo del idioma inglés, nos ubica a buscar la página en español, pero también Vtra. página lo ofrece, con lo cual, no tengo opinión para inferir en que se puede mejorar el proceso de contratación, el cuál es correcto, justo, preciso y claro.
Cordialmente."
"Este proceso, resulta innovador, ya que crea un entorno de confianza y seguridad.

Se tiene una selección adecuada de los perfiles y el presente cuestionario, brinda la oportunidad de conocer al candidato y el involucramiento que se puede lograr con los objetivos organizacionales.

La opción de oportunidad única, podría ser fortalecida con oportunidad invaluable, ya que el valor que le puede brindar cada una de las personas es diferente.

Agradezco la oportunidad de brindar esta opinión para fortalecer el proceso de selección de la organización."
estaria mucho mejor saber en que estatus se encuentra la seleccion del candidato
"estar mas en contacto con los aspirantes, para que conozcan un poco mas de la persona y su experiencia, generar una base de datos que te dirija a la vacante correcta de acuerdo a las habilidades de los aspirantes"
"Establishment of a networking with top universities and industry associations in order to find best prospects to hire as rising stars to develop within the career ladder of the company, if the case. For, directive and senior positions, it would be valuable to consider broad expertise and trajectory in areas no necessarily related to J&J business.  This to have a different approach about the job to perform.  In such cases, it would be interesting to remark the compensation package and other benefits that would attract better candidates.

Establish more direct contacts with the selection areas through direct telephones and social networks; Would also expand the languages ​​of the process.
"Establish a online application where the candidate could check if the resume is being considered, to what extent, and what are the chances to move on with the process."
Está sendo tudo conforme esperado
"esta meio confuso para mim responder a este questionario sem ao menos ter sido chamada para uma entrevista ou processo seletivo, poderiam esclarecer melhor este processo"
"Essa é a primeira experiência em processo de recrutamento com a Johson & Johnson, e como não participei de todas as etapas do processo ainda não consigo avaliar integralmente, porém, o sistema de recrutamento e seleção e sua aplicação  é excelente."
"Esclarecer melhor para o funcionário as prováveis datas das próximas etapas. No meu caso, aguardei mais de 20 dias a carta proposta sem saber exatamente quando eu a receberia. Tive que ligar para saber. "
Es un proceso muy completo y fácil de llevar un cabo
"Es muy valioso este tipo de espacios de retroalimentación del proceso de selección en J&J, más ahora que se espera la implementación del centro de servicios globales en la ciudad de Bogotá. Quizás estando en otras fases del proceso pude detectar oportunidades, pero por lo que he experimentado me pareció adecuado."

"En mi módica opinión creo que los procesos de selección son diseñados por profesionales en el area de captación, en cuanto a eso no lo pongo en duda, pero si creo que la verdadera percepción es cuando se da una entrevista. "
"En mi caso particular, tuve una única entrevista por teléfono. Me comentaron que el perfil se adecuaba a la posición, que iban a consultar a la persona que estaba en búsqueda de la persona y se contactarían conmigo. Sin embargo, jamás tuve feedback de que no continuaba en el proceso ni la razón.
Considero que este punto es muy importante para el postulante ya que le contribuye saber los motivos por los que no continua en el proceso y, además, ser informado al respecto es lo mínimo que uno espera."
"Em minha atual oportunidade, fui indicado a empresa por um outro colabadorador. Por esse motivo, ainda estou em fase de recrutamento.    "
"Em geral, fiquei muito satisfeito com o portal de carreiras da J&J. Porém algumas semanas após confirmar minha candidatura, e de ter recebido o email de confirmação, não houve mais nenhuma atualização do processo seletivo para a vaga em questão. "

Easier and smoothier application process directly via LinkedIn
Ease of accessing the application of your online pages
"Each company has own process in different ways, the most important is you can know exactly which are the abilities of each candidate.

"Choosing from hundreds of CVs is a difficult task when looking for an ideal candidate and evaluating resumes in standard formats look simple at first sight when using motors during the recruitment process. A test with ten key questions related to expected behaviors or competences (psicometry) according to the position searched, can give a better flavor about the characteristics of a candidate and could be the basis for go in deep with interesting candidates."
Check the experience of all staff and former candidates for the opportunity.

Call. To have a conversation in order to be just online. 
"Call the candidates or at least give them an email response within a few days about their recruitmment process. The silence is the worst companion.

By making recruitment processes more personalized.
By giving more options to recently graduate students like myself who are looking for job opportunities in an international company like JnJ wether the job is in my country (Mexico's city) or not. Starting with Trainee vacancies in HR in my particular case would make this process easier.
"By given a feedback for the applicant, also make it easier for the application on the company website."
"Buenos días estimados, yo creo desde mi punto de vista, que deberían darle la oportunidad de una entrevista personal, a jóvenes profesionales que estamos en la búsqueda de empleo, ya, que hay capacidades a favor y en contra que quizás mediante un C.V no se llegan a apreciar, estaría muy agradecido de tener una entrevista para saber también que cosas buenas tengo y que cosas debo mejorar, la empresa en cuestión tiene mucho prestigio internacional y cada  uno que manda su C.V desea que lo contraten, ya que daría gusto, confianza y seriedad a su labor estar respaldado por Johnson & Johnson. saluda atte Nicolás."

Sempre busco me candidatar as vagas disponíveis para está grande empresa dá qual admiro pela sua reputação, porém nunca tive a oportunidade de fazer parte de nenhum processo seletivo na empresa, sempre recebo apenas os e-mails de vagas e um tempo depois as considerações da qual não fui selecionada para o cargo, gostaria muito de um dia ter a oportunidade de ser selecionada e passar pelo processo seletivo na empresa, para que possa mostrar minhas habilidades e ter a experiência e uma opinião formada de como seria o processo dessa grande empresa mais, enquanto isso, continuarei a me atualizar, buscar novos conhecimentos e a me candidatar pelos e-mails que recebo, sempre com a esperança de um dia poder fazer parte dessa grande equipe.

Desde já agradeço pela atenção.

"Bom dia,

Fiz uma entrevista em 14 de Setembro de 2016 com o recrutador Bruno Morais, e após aprovado pelo mesmo fui entrevistado pelo gestor Carlos Lelis, para a vaga nº 4609160825 com o título   Analista de Call Center - Medical Devices - Equipment Division - Grande São Paulo em 20/09/2016  em Itapevi-SP.

Segundo o último FeedBack que recebi do recrutador Bruno Moraisé que em 18 de outubro, a vaga havia sido congelada, com probabilidade de reabertura em Março de 2017.

Em 30 de janeiro de 2017 fui novamente convocado via sistema para a Vaga nº  6436170117 - Analista de Call Center - Itapevi/SP - Medical - com a mesma descrição de atividades da vaga anterior, me fazendo entender que trata-se da mesma vaga. Sendo assim me candidatei novamente pelo site anexando meu curriculo e desde de então aguardo uma nova oportunidade para entrevista.

Como até o presente momento não recebi feedback sobre a aprovação ou não da entrevista que fiz em Setembro, minha dúvida é se poderei ou não participar de uma nova entrevista?

Obs. Pelo que tenho de informação o Recrutador que cuidou do meu primeiro processo não faz mais parte do quadro de colaboradores da Johnson & Johnson.


Atenciosamente,

Also try to be more specific with the positions, because in my case, I may have 100%, perfect fit, but  do not receive a call or email form recruitment team. 

Not sure but I find a direct correlation with better process when  the hiring process is from from a J&J own HR/TA team and an AWFUL hiring process when is with the outsource team that you hire (Ethnor del Istmo, S.A.).

This is the 3rd survey that I take, stating the same thing, criticizing the bad service from Ethnor del Istmo, S.A.

"At least set up an automatic reply for applicants that will not be considered for the position. It is a lack of respect with the applicants not to even do that, after they have taken the time to fill out a lengthy application."
At least sending updates in regards the process. Not a single mail of the status. 
At least make a contact with possible candidates. I never received an answer.
"at least have the formal and appropriate forms to inform us, the applicants or candidates.the negative answer to our application. what i have received from j&j is absolutely nothing. that speaks very bad of the #1 company in pharma world. i could bet or dare that even after my answer to this survey no one from jj will contact me even when several persons in jj jannsen mexico know me very well which leads me to suspect they or at least one  of them have something against me  and i again dare or bet if this has to do with a negative academic or professional or background issue (of mine) . so i guess i have lost my time by answering this survey. because otherwise might occur. i am almost sure these comments i have issued will never get to th appropriate hierarchic level in jj jannsen and they will be disregarded or deleted by a noxious middle level employee before it might get to a really senior level executive (country head or above). anyway thanks"
Aswering to their postulants after application and making a feed back if its necessary.
Ask me to a interview would be a great opportunity to improve the recruitment process.
"As you are having interviews, you may be discussing how the recruitment processes are going.
In my interview with the HR staff very friendly fus and container. 
When I was waiting for an interview, at that time you felt comfortable in the work environment, and that speaks very well of the company, are important values."
As we are in the beginning of the process my overview is not bug enough to give mature suggestions. Maybe if it will be moving forward I will be more prepared to give improvement suggestions.
As soon as we post as a candidate should we receive a personal contact from RH.
As same J&J provide a feedback about application. It's very important to send a feedback for a candidate positive or negative. I don't receive any feedback about this process.
"As part of the process may exist a information once you have submited your CV, in order to let know the candidate, how is process and what kind of step is involved itself. If is possible estimated date of upgrade CV status."
"As far as I have seen the process is very clear.  I would suggest more organization when having the interviews as I could notice some lack of communication between the security service and HR.  However, I want to stress that this was a minor situation; the interview process was awesome, very smooth and clear."
"As far as I could participate as a candidate, the recruitment process is according to what I expected from the Company."
"As a potential worker, I think it would be great to get a feedback from Johnson & Johnson even in the situation of not being selected. I think it would be also nice to get information on new opportunities and positions. 
Best,
Roger Pobbe."
"Apply for employment, but I have not yet been interviewed, so I do not know the whole process to evaluate it. I am very excited to continue in the hiring process.
continue to you orders."
"Application was very easy to be done, so no further suggestions at the moment. Thanks for asking."
Application was straight forward. 
Application of exams according to online profile
Aplicar testes como este online.
"Apesar do processo virtual dessa ser mais rápido eu ainda acho ele muito vago. A entrevista ainda é a forma mais clara para conhecer o candidato e reduzir a margem de erros. Nem mesmo um bom currículo pode traduzir exatamente o candidato. Eu posso ter um ótimo currículo e ser péssima para a função ou, posso ter um currículo normal e ter muita facilidade de relacionamento, sendo essencial para o cargo.
Acredito na boa comunicação e no bom relacionamento.
Estou a disposição!"
"Apenas dar um feedback ao candidato sobre sua candidatura à vaga.
Obrigada!"
"Ao presente momento acredito que tudo está na medida certo, aproveito o espaço para parabenizar pelo Feedback pois a maioria esmagadora das empresas não costuma dar retorno sobre seus processos aos candidato."
Anything.
Any opportunity for improvement has been identified in the process. The site's platform is easy to use.

Allow to download the file with the resumee instead of linking to external sites (LinkedIn)

"A good way would be to give the opportunity to applicants of showing abilities through a test where they might be able to solve specific circumstances about daily situations they will face when working for Johnson, the idea is not testing knowledge but trouble solving capacity. "
"A good employee is not only who has a great knowledge, but the right person who wants to grow with the company, who wants to give more. It is good to look for the candidate who can offer both and not only the one who has a good resume, I have not had the opportunity to be with the human resources department, but I imagine they must handle the selection very well.
"
"A forma do processo seletivo é bem aceitável, pois, a Johnson & Johnson faz a seleção do currículo de acordo com o perfil da vaga, e posteriormente acredito que seja uma entrevista pessoalmente com o candidato.  "
A Feedback to all candidates after each momente during de processes.
A feedback can be very useful to us as an applicant. 
A faster selection process.
A equipe de recrutamento poderia fornecer um feed back aos participantes nos processos.
"A entrevista via telefone/ Skype não permite ao processo uma avaliação de melhor precisão acerca do perfil do candidato e sinais identificados apenas na entrevista presencial por profissionais com expertise em seleção. 

Acredito que a extensão territorial é um fator negativo e por isso se recorre à entrevista via telefone/ Skype, porém como sugestão oriento a habilitação de agências de RH  nas respectivas cidades sedes das vagas para fazer pessoalmente o primeiro contato. Desta forma, haverá melhor oportunidade para avaliar o perfil como um todo e dessa forma fugir do padrão apenas histórico de carreira, o grupo J&J é um dos principais grupos globais e pra tal a capacidade de treinamentos e formação de profissionais de acordo com perfil é de grande potencial.

Há 10 anos tento uma vaga no grupo J&J e não tenho dúvida que a perseverança que tenho em almejar uma vaga é uma leitura real da grande oportunidade de carreira e ascensão de competência e profissional.

Obrigado."
"A empresa poderia dar um retorno aos interessados nas vagas que se inscreveram e não conseguiram ser contratados. Exemplo: faltou o conhecimento em tal assunto, seria interessante uma especialização em determinada área. Para que dessa forma as pessoas que se interessam em trabalhar na J&J possam se preparar melhor."
A empresa poderia dar um feedback quanto às candidaturas aplicadas ao interessado/candidato.
A closer follow-up of the individual recruitment process could be beneficial for both the candidates and the company.
"A clearer feedback of the process, what stage it is and further steps"
A clear and transparent process of assigment and interviews. I assume I was not chosenm since this is the first contact from J&J after my application.
A better communication with candidates. But in this moment I stay in the first step of the process maybe I need more time to provide my opinion.

"&JI applied many times in a big number of positions at J&J but I´ve never had a feedback, positive or negative and this kind of thing make the difference between the companies."
 You can give feedback to candidates who have been selected but who have not been approved. Maybe this can be a meaningful learning for your carrers.
 Todo excelente 
" the recruitment process is outstanding, one of bests I've participated, to keep in touch with candidates frequently"
 The application process was very easy; also I would like to receive the test result about the vacant position 
" Strong Communication
 Make the opportunity to talks with peaple involved in order to show the skills and experience that peaple have.
  Share with clear answers the steps of the own process even if the peaple apply will not have the opportunity to be selected."
 Provide feedback to candidates.
" Nothing by now, the process is clear, friendly and fast.

Congratulations!!"
 make it simple
" In some cases, I not receive any contact of HR of my candidatures so I would like that the HR talk with the candidates that not have internal indication."
 I would like to get more information before the survey. Currently I am not so sure about if the process is open or close
" I THINK YOU COULD CALL THE CANDIDATES, OR SEND A MAIL, BUT CUSTOMIZED, NOT ALL SO AUTOMATED, THIS WOULD GIVE GREATER CLOSE"
" I think is necesary more comunication with the candidate during the selection process.
"
" I see no realy problem , and thanck you for opportunity to give my feedback"
 feedback about application 
 A clear communication about the process status. I applied to a role about 2 or 3 weeks ago and I have not received a response except the request to fill this survey.
" - Inform candidates of every step of the process, while they are on it.
 - Consider candidates' experience and will on getting this job and also entering the company."
"  O processo foi dividido em algumas etapas,onde os recrutadores procuravam de fato entender a capacitação e habilidade profissional,acredito que estão completamente corretos na maneira de recrutar e entrevistar os candidatos.
  Logicamente que fiquei com uma grande expectativa a cada fase,mas agora que estou contratada pela Johnson&Johnson entendo sua colocação no mercado,pois tudo começa em um processo rigoroso para contratação de seus profissionais.
  Obrigado a toda equipe J&J pela oportunidade,e podem esperar o melhor de mim para a Compania."

"
Take into account the record of the person you recommend"

Since I have not yet passed instances of the process, I see it with high expectations. It would be great if the Talent Adquisition team will contact me either by phone or email.

"
it's a good system"
"
It is important to inform the person whether or not he was admitted in the process"
"
It is always important to show interest in opinion without having a person in the staff. This is the reason that people looking for opportunity may have the interest to be part of a company that respects the person and the professionalism of each one, with theirs and experiences. Always respect is important for anyone who wants to get into the job market."

Indicate which segment of action refers to the opportunity because the company has several businesses"

Include prior selection a survey to help verify the requirements required for the position"
"
In my opinion has the right and correct criterion. I do not see how to improve, as the company seeks excellence in its choices"

In my experience and opinion the transparency of the process is the most important. And that all candidates are people with different life experiences. I love it when they really want to know me as an individual in addition to my experience and my studies because this way I can know the values ​​and ethics of the applicant."
"
Improve candidate notice times on results."

I think they should give possibilities to young people with no experience ..
They need to work although to clean the floor, not to have a university degree someone is more or less than another person who did not have the same opportunities"

Hire attitude and develop aptitude, the experience is acquired by developing the tasks ........"

Have an interview opportunity to see if the candidate has potential to belong Johnson & Johnson"

For me the process is ok

Display a timeline indicating the status of the process and whether the application is in progress."

Despite being an American company doing the process by the Internet in Portuguese or Spanish would greatly facilitate the lives of those who are not fluent in English."

Communicate with the aspirants by phone to get ready on the cv"

Be more direct than the interviews"

Add Spanish language"

What can Johnson & Johnson do to improve the recruitment process?
"•	Build relationships with cultural groups and organizations that work with diverse communities. 
True diversity starts with a mission to gain strength as an organization through recruiting a variety of outstanding people with diverse backgrounds, skills, ideas and cultures. It ends with your company reaching out to a specifically targeted audience that will help your business achieve that mission.
Now more than ever it is critical that employers recognize that diversity has become a benchmark in how they are perceived.
"
Your website was easy to follow and instructions were clear and concise.
Your website is very user friendly and has improved over the years
"Your web site is very well designed! I had no problem accessing the site, and understanding the job descriptions. The application process was also very easy to follow. I hope to hear from you soon!"
Your system is ineffective: causing you to miss the best candidates. Does not speak well for company or its prospects to advance in new technologies.
Your site was fluid and straight to the point. I wouldn't change a thing. 
"Your recruitment process is yet to be desired.  I have applied for positions I am qualified for (being a previous successfully J&J employee) and have yet to get any communication other than these surveys.  I have had employee referrals and still no interview/call/discussion.  I wanted to get back to J&J because I loved it, but J&J has no loyalty to previous employees.  "
Your recruitment process is the same as most companies so far. 
"Your recruitment process is cold and dark.  I have over 20 years of experience.  A pat email response that my application is not being considered is beneath your organization.  I am not beneath your organization, and an opportunity to prove that would be welcome.  But as long as you are running a computer algorithm to tell you that instead of common sense, you will not filter out your better candidates like myself.  So keep sending surveys and I'll keep sending applications until you run out of candidates to filter and I'll be there to take your organization to new heights."
"Your recruitment process is a nice change from the majority of others I have had an experience with.  Thank you for asking for only the necessary information, as opposed to my life history that others ask for, at this stage of the process.

You recruitment process is much better than almost any other that I have had contact with.  I did not see anything that I would change to make the candidate experience, at least at this point, any better."
Your recruiting team and overall process is horrible. 
Your recruiter reached out to me via LinkedIn.  I said I was interested and forwarded my resume yet never heard back.  It's ok if you decide to go a different direction but since your company contacted me a follow up email or contact seems reasonable.  
Your process was very straightforward
Your process is well thought out and easy to follow.
"Your process is very solid.  You have an excellent reputation and I would expect nothing less.  I have yet to hear back from you regarding the position I applied for, so the one comment I will make is that it is a best practice to respond to people who apply, even if they are not selected.  The more personal the reply, the better.  I know that it is not possible to give personal reply to everyone, but I hope that you would do your best.  It demonstrates respect for the time and energy that people put into applying as well as it shows respect for the fact that people are interested in contributing important life skills and talents to support your company.  Many thanks."
"Your job posting and application process is straight forward and simplified compared to other enterprise business job boards.  However, I have not received an e-mail of confirmation, request for an interview or rejection for this position, identified in your survey request.  

Sr. It Project Manager, It Enterprise Capabilities Strategy & Deployment.

As pharmaceuticals move forward in digital multi channel marketing, regulatory alignment and voice of the customer will be imperative to success, so I am more than happy to assist J&J with feedback on their recruitment process; simplification is key."
"Your HR recruiter emailed me for a time to talk, then never called... twice!
Most unprofessional company i have ever dealt with. "
Your HR department and recruiter should be more punctual for the interview appointment.
Your electronic application process is confusing and more prohibitive than other website I've encountered.
"Your credentials and qualifications for job titles posted do not align well. The vetting process needs to be improved. I have worked in international logistics for 22 years and was not offered any personal dialogue from J&J to discuss the expectations, only electronic interface stating I did not qualify.  Please put some humanity into your hiring process."
Your asking me to complete a survey yet I never heard back from anyone from my application. Does that not seem odd?
"Your application process, by far, is one of the most efficiently designed and well-thought out online application processes I've seen. I was extremely impressed by just that factor alone and thoaight ""This is a company that I should work with."""
Your application process was the easiest I have ever experienced.  Kudos to the set up. It was so nice and easy I almost thought I made a mistake. 
Your application process was a lot easier than most! Very much appreciated. I used to work for Quintiles on a JNJ contract and view the company and people very highly. I hope to work for JNJ. It would be my dream job for an extraordinary company! 
"Your application process is very user friendly and your job descriptions are very thorough.  I have been a lifelong brand loyalist to Johnson & Johnson's family of products, especially your iconic NEUTROGENA brand.  You application process certainly mirrors the high quality that I consistently receive from your great products.  As an extremely interested candidate for a brand marketing opportunity with NEUTROGENA, thank you for that!"
You've sent me this survey a couple times
"You're posting was easy to locate, uncomplicated to apply to and I received a response in a timely fashion. Keep doing what you're doing! I am eager to join your team and hope I get the opportunity to do so. "
"You won't be surprised to hear this, but make it move faster.....or at least provide dated, timely updates as to where decision-makers currently are in the overall  process (building candidate slate, scheduling/arranging interviews, interviewing, collecting interviewer feedback, making final selection)   "
"You will never hire people who don't have a connection, MBA or healthcare experience.  People weren't born with healthcare experience and MBA grads don't always have experience so it's very short sighed. Given the negative press and lawsuits I've seen, I would think you'd be open to new ways but your not so I won't be applying again. "
"You will need to read this important message.

DOUG GRAY WAS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR MY EXECUTION OR EXTERMINATION FROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

#DougGray @UUtah Childrapist racist xenophobe homophobe bisexual transgender bully https://goo.gl/2gucfN

Christians are the greatest bane on earth....   

I have good reason for this.... as a successful foreign medical graduate there was no tolerance in Christian Mormon dominated Utah USA and I was exterminated eliminated or kicked out whatever you may want to call it... this is soft terror... this is soft genocide...   

I do not care about any of that but the fact that I felt used... the fact that I was exploited will never ever go away...   

TRUTH: Christians exploit to convert... if they find nothing they at least make sure that they pull the plug on some essential aspect of a successful person so as to make sure that there is a person who will save and thus convert... making sure that Christ or the Lord is the only savior... 

What The Fuck... yes WTF...   

Read about Christian corruption at https://goo.gl/qs23Hf   

Also Read about my true happenings while in America https://goo.gl/P56QyV   

Great to make your contact....  

Many terrorists are going to be born and raised in the US and exported all over the world from now on !!!
 
May the GODS and GODESSESS bless you your family and all your extended family that have been wrongfully converted into the wrong religion....   

Take care
"
You should state which third party companies / recruitment services you use so I know they are not a scam.
You should really close the loop with applicants. I've applied to multiple roles at JNJ and have yet to hear from anyone at the company about them. It would really be beneficial if JNJ provided feedback to applicants if they aren't the right fit for the role. 
"You should probably respond to candidates if you reached out to them to schedule an interview.   In my case, an HR person contacted me regarding the position that I applied for and asked if I was aware that relocation was not offered before further conversations. I responded and said that I'm ok with that and would still like to be considered for the position.  I responded a second time to the HR person and nothing.  My takeaway is that she probably sent me an email to ""check the box"" to say she reached out to me and probably lied and said I wasn't interested.  I'm sure this HR practice doesn't fit in with Johnson & Johnson's core values or maybe it does.  "
You should follow-up with applicants on their status! I'm looking forward to learning more about the role and next steps. 
"You should be sending a followup e-mail asking candidates for their real time experiences related to your job and their current job, this can help you to identify better talent."
You should also provide an oppertunity to people from abroad. Might their experiences fulfill your requirment better than local fellow.
You rock. Thank you for the smooth and easy application process 
"You provided excellent information about the position and would only recommend having information for the facility location.  I'm from the area for this posting, but for those from outside the area, it would be great to have information and links for areas near the facility, city and surrounding areas (local attractions, restaurants, etc.)."
"You never get in touch with me so until this email arrive with the survey, I supposed the position is already filled."
"You need to give feedback as to why a person did not get an interview. You need to be specific so people don't waste their time reapplying if there's no interest, or there may be a misunderstanding from the resume. You need direct contact."
"You need to drill down on specifics of the requirement. The position is information technology focus but the role is lost in areas that covey that requirement. The roles speaks of working with stakeholders but that is too general to place in description. Stakeholders vary by need, timing, and other external factors and pressures,"
"You mean becides hiring me?  I liked the process, but there was some redundancy with entering information that is already on my resume.  Not a hastle, just a minor annoyance (but still far better than applting at most companies)."
You may want to look at the compatibility of the careers site with various browsers.   I encountered a number of instances when attempting to log in or change my password resulted in a perpetual loading screen.  
"You may want to add some free text space when asking about specific disease state knowledge.  

Nice, easy process to use."
You may not like my comment but you need new talent acquisition team
You have to call me 
"You don't hire me and want my feedback?   Fuck off and die.  I was eminently qualified for the position for which I applied, but you do not provide feedback on who you hired and why I WAS NOT HIRED.  You are fucking pieces of work.  Tank your stock, tank your pipeline and die."
"You declined my ""application"" yet later sent an email if I knew anyone interested in the role I had applied for. Insulting. "
"You could start by creating a database of your existing talent.  I have spent alot of time researching the role, but if I dont get this position there is no bank that potential talent is stored for future consideartion on other positions.

Second, there is no feedback from the so called recruiter. They are anything but and this is suppose to be J&J right? I submitted my resume and never even got an email from the guy assigned to recruiting for this position......so it made me feel completely in the dark and not really desirable as a candidate.  No information from anyone as to what the process is.

There is zero leadership development here - I have been asking for over 2 years on how I can learn more about the opportunities that  match my skill sets within the company, but noone actively recruits or farms the talent here,which is why I will be leaving the company as soon as I can."
You could introduce into the survey questions better suited to the role for which a person is a candidate
You could improve follow up process by indicating status of application on applicant's profile (active vs inactive).
"You could have your representatives reach out to external candidates that happen to be contractors currently to let them know they will not be moving forward with even a phone screen, especially since the job description is almost identical to what is in the resume, as well as working in the group currently."
You can update applicants on progress.  I received an acknowledgement email and I've heard nothing else.  My J&J referrer spent a lot of time drafting and submitting a thoughtful referral and has been checking the job vacancy but there seems to be no action being taken ..... I've had mire emails asking about my experience but I've had not an experience .... disappointing and expected a bit more 
You can post more vacancies for internships and co-ops. It would also be great for jobs fir individuals with less experience to prove they are capable of filling the positions 
You can perfect the process by hiring me. ;o)
You can make a preliminary round in order to make the recruiter's eligibility for the job. It will make each candidate to ensure their worth for the job.
You can improve the time to response to the appliers.
"you can hire me ,witch  would be a great morale buster ."
"You can have this survey soon after the application was completed to gain better insights as memories are fresh regarding the application process.

The application process itself is standard cookie cutter. So I have a neutral opinion. "
You can communicate in a timely fashion if a candidate is being considered for a job. I've been waiting quite a long time to hear a response. 
"You can call me for an interview.  I have not heard back.

"You asked me to fill out a survey on the recruitment process, but I never heard anything from you.  No response at all after I took the time to fill out the application.  I would have liked an opportunity to interview and speak with some recruiters."
"You are utilizing LinkedIn, which is a great start. I am always looking for more feedback On how well my KSAOs line up well with a position. If J&J provided feedback, even if it was a little more general to the applicants, I would be interested in seeing how I could improve or present my skills in a better light. I would also look into the Facebook job application as it is developing-I'm most interested in pursuing a career in HR. Please contact me at 973-908-7448 if you are in search of a professional who is passionate about developing HR initiatives wherever she is."
You are doing fantastic.
You are doing an excellent job. Keep up the good work. 
"You are doing a great job. Overall process was simple, and straight forward. Thanks for the consideration"
"You are asking me for my feedback, yet never had the courtesy to even respond to my application.... seems very one directional view of the company. "
"You are a liability to the JnJ brand. Ad a management professional, I have never come across a poorer, less professional HR Recruitment organization, you are the worst!!!"
You appear to have a good well thought out program. My biggest concern right now is actually getting your interview. 
Yes Absolutely! The JnJ recruitment process is like a black hole.You hear back 4-5 months later for an interview.
"Yes ... I know it's hard , but if you can send some analytics why the person is not selected , instead of generic mail .. it's better for the person to access his & her skills & give chance of self improvement "
Yes
Yes
YEah there HR needs to read the damn resumes better I do too qulfy for the damn job! JUST BECUSE ITS A DIFRENT INDUSTRY DOSNT MEAN I CANT HANDLE THE DAMN ASS JOB!

It would be great to have the ability to better connect directly to try to improve chances of in person interviews. "
Would lIke to know if the applied job wasn't a fit if there would be better fit and potentially  suggest other opportunities. 
Would like to have an update on the status of my application.
"Would like an email response back whether I was in consideration or not. And then, another email once job had been filled."
"Would it be possible to provides a ""dashboard"" of where applicants stand in the process?  Resume review, hiring manager review, initial interview, etc.

Also, I applied for a project manager role.  While an basic, short question is to be expected, the broad open ended questionin experience seemed a little clunky and better suited for a discussion."
Would it be possible to give the applicant a phone number or why to contact someone for a status on their application? Or some tracking method to see the application's current status?
Would have to receive a personal note not automated response. We are talking about an important role not a generic one
"Would have liked to hear from J&J sooner, if I wasn't going to be a candidate for the position. Feel that this process dragged on for nothing. If I wasn't even going to make the short list, at least notify me sooner."
would have been helpful to receive the case when it was communicated that i would receive it rather than me having to follow-up
Would give the opportunity to have a personal enterview and match the better job for each one. 
Would be very helpful if candidate can review or notified status of their application along with feedback for their own improvement. Thanks 
Would be nice to receive a survey after engaging in the process not before.  Certainly from and analytics perspective this will be a miss when accessing your application process.  Give me a call sometime and we can discuss further.
Would be nice to have a more modern online application system.
"Would be nice to get some feedback even if you aren't selected. While it's nice to get closure and know one way or the other, a form letter doesn't really give you an opportunity to work on whatever it is you need to make yourself a more desirable candidate. Not sure if I should vother applying for any other positions at your company or if it would just be a waste of time for everyone. "
Would be nice to get a response regarding application and recruitment status.
Would be helpful to hear back from J&J 
Would be helpful to get a response on whether or not your resume was reviewed so you don't feel like it was dropped into a black hole. 
Would appreciate update on application status and consideration for future opportunities - thank you!
Would appreciate to a quick response or a timeline for a response
Would appreciate better response /feedback mechanism.
Would appreciate a more personal touch.  Process is cold.
Working for the company should give a heavier weighted average toward the hiring process. 
wonder why you are sending me detailed analysis about my recruitment process when I cannot get past the application stage...
"With the volume of great candidate applications you receive these are my suggestions.
A Sales Coordinator or Field Sales support agent will require a positive voice. Speak to the Candidate and ask they repeat a series of sentence selections based on medical knowledge for clarity. Email a list of questions appropriate to the position to review and include ones a Physician, Sales Rep & Customer may ask.. Meet with the candidates before determining their benefits strictly based on paper. Ask for names of current employees that can provide character reference. Follow up is important to the Candidate. Community perception of a company and its values are important. "
"With the state of the economy, I am sure Johnson and Johnson receives many applications for its various openings.  I think those applicants that will not proceed further into the process would like to know as soon as possible so that they can move on and concentrate their efforts elsewhere. "
"With the hiring process as it is today, using filters and word searches, not sure much can be done to improve or change the recruitment process.  What lacks today is the personal interaction that is not always gleaned from a computer sorting resume's.  I recognize with the high number of applicants it is not always prudent or possible to have that personal interaction.  This appears to be a case of adapting to the times."
"With the advancement In technology, and the use of automation to filter out candidates I find that organizations may be missing out on those applicants that are well suited but not evident to a program or filter.   I understand that with the number of candidates that apply for any given role make meeting with every candidate not always feasible but in order to increase the chance of obtaining an excellent resource I still believe that having the hiring manager screen candidates cover letters, and meeting face to face with candidates is the best way to ensure a candidate with excellent capabilities is not overlooked."
"With respect to pharmaceutical sciences recruitment, there should be more interaction with schools/colleges of pharmacy across the country."
"With regards to the current role I applied for, I was frustrated with the process as I had received and email advising me that they had taken down the posting and were not moving forward with this role due to the company not hiring for it anymore. "
"With nine years of dental industry experience in marketing, I would have liked my application to be considered.  It seems like the process didn't lend a serious look at my experience."
"With all due respect, the recruitment process has been confusing. After I applied for the position I received an email indicating that I had been referred for the position and asking me to apply. I wasn't sure if I needed to re-apply and I received no response to this question. Next I received this survey but still have not been invited for an interview nor received a regrets notification. I'm not sure what the status of my application is at this point or if the position is still available."
"With a company of your size and multitude of applicants I realize this may be difficult to do.  However, it would be great to get communication from someone to let you know if you're in the mix of candidates to considered.  This is the company that I want to retire with so I will continue to look at any opportunities that surface with J & J.  "
"With 35 years within JnJ, the process has proven to be satisfactory without any deficiencies that need improvement"
Wish I had been selected ... 
Why would you send this email to people who weren't even offered a chance at an interview? Bold strategy. 
"Why send out a survey when no conversation took place?
Or is this the new way of saying people are not selected?"
Why don't you try following up on the specific role applied for and send a note to state the role has been filled?  These surveys are worthless.  
Why can't I update my phone number on my profile? It's correct in JJEDS but it's not correct in OurSource.
Why bother to post positions when you don't even give qualified candidates the courtesy of a phone screen. Pure age discrimination!
Why am I doing this stupid survey when no one called or emailed me nor did I get one of those cheesy emails saying they moved on with another candidate.  This is a joke right?  The recruitment sucks. 
"Whilst there was no reason provided for my candidature rejection, I would like to know if I didn't fit due to one or many reasons..Else I would be glad to work for one of the best industry fighting for a healthier world."
"While this response was timely, I have had other experiences with Johnson and Johnson recruitment in which I had a very delayed or no response. Please, respond to candidates as quickly as possible, whether it be with acceptance or rejection. "
"While the job portal and the job postings were clear, precise and easy to use I just feel that if you can also send confirmation emails to those candidates that you have rejected it would be really helpful. "
"While the external link application process through LinkedIn was good, the J&J career site is very time consuming and difficult to use. The search capability and ease of use can use some significant improvement. I would be happy to discuss the details by phone. 3174422590  Brian"
"While the application process was fairly straight forward there was no follow up. I was referred by an internal colleague yet no update on progress or indication that role was filled till i see this survey. 
Does this mean the role is filled? "
"While not recruited and instead simply applying to a job found on the career site, I appreciated the prompt feedback regarding the decision to go with other candidates.  Too often applications are submitted never to be heard from again. I have even more respect for J & J as a brand for extending this simple courtesy. Thank You."
"While not always possible, provide an indication as to when the position is expected to be filled."
"While J&J have good products and company model as well as being around for many years (which is one aspect I consider is stability), I am no longer applying with with your organization as it has been proven time and again they are not interested in my background considering I have extensive knowledge and experience not only in their industry but from multiple industries which brings best practices, but methods, a fresh viewpoint, a 360 viewpoint which includes a 5 star customer experience, extensive experience with multiple government regulations and government entities, and commercial business across the thresholds.  
To have applied multiple times for roles that are in line with my background and experience to the job description that has been provided and receiving no personal contact from HR, a hiring manager or even a personal discussion or interview from a strategic viewpoint as there may be other roles or capacity that can utilize my background is a bit ignorant.  However, to continually be rejected proves to me someone clearly does not understand my background in the least or is a plain lack of interest or intimidated by my background.  I am extremely secure about my background and myself and happy to share my knowledge but I will not waste my time on a company that is narrow minded and is unable to see my value to support their initiatives and can help them from a strategic, legal, financial, or vendor, relationship, and operational standpoint.  
Companies such as Kaiser Permanente and multiple pharma companies have hired me over the phone in consulting capacities including hiring me into permanent roles to address their challenges and resolve them with my subject matter expertise and to not even receive a call other than a rejection letter that has the inability to respond to is offensive; especially at a VP level.  
Does your company not have a voice of the customer?  If not, maybe you should be talking to your HR lead as candidates are also customers on the market and they also reflect your bottom line of why you are in business; to generate revenue.  

To not have someone at least contact me to find out my back story and only does word searches is NOT recruiting appropriately and is certainly losing out on exceptional candidates.  It is not only with me but colleagues in other industries that are seeking work at a Manager to C level that are running into the SAME situations.  Corporations wonder why they are not getting qualified candidates, I highly encourage you start overhauling HR and their processes as it is a real problem.
As a SME, it is to the advantage of any company to at minimum talk with me.  I am NOT a candidate fresh out of college with little experience but an individual with a double MBA from a doctoral university, certifications directly in my field of expertise and years of experience that ANY company can benefit from; especially when my abilities generate new revenue and income for them and save them millions (documented) of dollars through my strategic planning, implementation, training, methods and processes.

If J&J does not see the value in me another company will.  There are plenty of companies like Kaiser, McKesson, Merck, Stryker and others that have utilized my background and know the value I present and have had the benefit of utilizing me as a Consultant or FT employee.

The final rating is how I view J&J.  0 is the rating due to how I have been handled as a candidate and still receiving that 5 for the products the company produces which could have raised J&J to a 10 had I been treated appropriately.  It is one thing to not be qualified and have another candidate be a better match but to ""blow off"" a candidate as me is unacceptable and a loss of talent.  It is up to you now how you choose to respond to the feedback provided.  Justification can be documented all you want but that still does not mean there is NOT an existing issue.

"While initial contact is probably through a machine that matches the resume to the job description, I would benefit from some minor feedback as to why I was not concidered."
"While I was offered the position as the #1 candidate, I did not take it based on compensation and a feeling of disconnect between the position and the hiring manager.  Additionally, I was told by HR to provide ""a number"" that I wanted to ""come over at"".  When I shared a range, I was told that was outside the band.  End of discussion.  My opinion of Janssen and J&J has changed.  Overall, this has NOT been a good, professional experience and I am relieved I did not take the position."
"While I understand you probably get hundreds, if not thousands, of applications in a week, I would still like to have the name of a person. Using an online application software can be lose the human element of human resources."
While I understand the internal role of a recruitment team is to screen and reduce the number of candidates presented to the hiring team.  I would have appreciated even a small phone interview so that I could learn more about the opportunity and present my experiences as a fit.
"While I understand J&J cannot respond to every application sent (that there could be 400+ for a single application), I do wish that those who have all of the listed qualifications required received a little more than a form letter saying they are not moving forward.

For example, there are many of us who might seem overqualified or that our qualifications would make it seem like we are asking for more compensation than the role dictates or might leave once a better role comes alone, when that is not the case.  (Using myself as an example, one might think since I have 25+ years of experience, my salary requirements would be exceptionally high, but I am looking for roles with a $65k+ qualification.)

Please do not judge all applicants the same.  Those of us with experience are not job hoppers like the current trend to stay 2-3 years or even 5 years then leave.  We are looking for homes where we can retire at.  I had hoped that might have been J&J if the fit was right for both of us."
"While I realize that you must get a tremendous amount of interest in your open positions and it would be hard to reach out to everyone, I was particularly disappointed that I was not considered for your opening. I am very interested in working for your company and have only applied to positions that were a good fit with my background and experience yet I have not been contacted by a member of your team. "
"While I realize it is difficult to acknowledge all applicants due to the numbers involved, it would be good to update applicants periodically.  ie have an automated system send out notices when application process is closed, when the position has been filled etc"
"While I only applied for the position a little over a week ago, it would be beneficial and helpful to receive updates via email of what the next step in the decision making process are. Also, should the position become fulfilled or unavailable, it would be great to receive feedback and/or insight if other strong candidates are placed into a talent pool for future openings in relates positions."
"While I have submitted an application, I have not had any further engagement with Johnson & Johnson, however, my experience thus far has been excellent and I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to refinement of the process.  One of the biggest frustrations for today's job seekers is the difficulty encountered in understanding the progress of their application.  As I said, I am unsure as to how my current application will progress, but I would encourage all employers to feedback to applicants to the extent that they are able.  I do acknowledge that a company like Johnson & Johnson must receive an awful lot of applications which make this difficult, but, good news or 'bad' news, it is nice to know where you stand!  Thank you again for the opportunity to comment!  "
"While I did not go through a specific interview process, I appreciated receiving the email notice which indicated that the position was placed on hold. 

If the position becomes active, I would like to engage in a discussion with your team to explore it more thoroughly. 

Kindly,

"While I believe I am a good fit with the role, as well as many other roles applied in the past, its been slightly disappointing to not have received any specific feedback to indicate whether my profile was considered for the application, and what the review process was like. I understand it is difficult to get to every applicant, but perhaps ones with a close fit would be worthy of improvement feedback. Thank you!"
"While I am still very early in the process (I have applied for a position and received an automated confirmation email), I have been impressed so far.  The application system was rather intuitive and I received a application confirmation email rather quickly.  To this point in the process, I have no improvements that I can recommend."
"While I accept the modern electronic process for job application, the completely dehumanized process is frustrating and feels ineffective. Adding any level of personalization--roughly equivalent to the old Personnel Office--would be encouraging to applicants and could give J&J better I sight to candidates...Not everyone is a good test-taker and some are not good resume revelors. "
"While difficult, feedback to why the applicant wasn't accepted would be appreciated. Obviously, the numbers wouldn't make it possible, but every other aspect of the process was very positive. "

"When you apply to roles in other companies, you will often receive a confirmation email thanking you for your application. That provides a piece of mind, knowing everything was submitted successfully. If you are an internal candidate, it's easy to find the hiring manager and recruiter in the system, but even reaching out to them doesn't always yield a response.

This posting was taken down from my careeropportunities.net- I only noticed that after searching for it a few days after I applied for it. In My Job tab, it listed this job, saying I applied to it and showing the current status of the job as ""Active, Accepting Applications"", but that could not have been the case since the posting had been removed. I emailed the recruiter asking for the status and they quickly responded saying it will be re-posted in a few months with a revised description. If i didn't reach out to the recruiter, there would have been no communication about the status of this position and I would have thought I was not being considered as a candidate, but no one called or emailed me to let me know.

"When you already have an account, there should be a ""Sign In"" button on the pages that are accessible from the internet.  It isn't always clear whether I am signed in already or I am creating a new account."
"When the professional does not fit in a process, would be interesting to describe why."
When specifically referring to the position that involves a background in education it might be a good idea to allow applicants to have the opportunity to elaborate more on their experience.  This may help you more accurately field your pool of applicants.
"When setting phone screen interview, let the candidate know ahead of time if it is with a recruiter or the hiring DM."
"When sending these surveys out, it would be nice to see a posting number--I apply to a few jobs and they are typically the same ""family"" of jobs, ex; Facilities Manager.  To know if this was a Facilities manager in Cincinnati or Southern California would help me answer the survey specifically v. generally."

"When posting a position on Linkedin, Johnson & Johnson should add the contact associated with the role, whether its the hiring manager or human resources representative. This would allow the candidate to properly deliver the cover letter as well as gaining a better understanding of the company by viewing his/her profile."
"When J&J H.R. choose not to continue with an applicant process, he or she deserves to know the reasons why.  Contrary to the general believing, this would greatly increase the feeling that the process was a fair one.  This in turn, will greatly increase the standing of J&J as a great place to work; that your Credo is not a dead document but a living statement of your true values. 
Knowing the real reasons why you were not chosen, allows you to make self-adjustments and try to be a better candidate the next time.  For me, being part of J&J is one of my goals, and this is why I had been trying for several years now -and several positions, and I will continue until I reach that goal."
"When it comes to interviewing and hiring veterans, Johnson and Johnson seems to be seriously deficient. Between a career in military service and graduating from an MBA class in the top 1%, you'd think that an interview would be a foregone conclusion. Yet I can't even get a phone call, just the standard thanks but no thanks automated email response."
"When is position is filled or an applicant is deemed under/over qualified, it would be helpful if an automated system notified applicants that they are not longer being considered."

Some people wish to provide have only fond memories of J&J and only wish to continue that legacy.  

I don't know if I was selected but I will continue to apply.  Thanks! Ruth Barnett"
"When I received word I was being considered for one of the postings I replied to I was told I needed to submit a virtual interview. I found this to be very frustrating because I tried to record all 7 responses on my phone but every time I completed all my answers, I would submit and only 2 of the videos would successfully upload.   It took me a total of 5 attempts to get all 7 video responses uploaded and transferred in full.   I still haven't heard back from J&J as to whether or not I'm still being considered for the role I was contacted about and I'm wondering if it's because my submissions were received on a piece meal basis. I'm also wondering if the technical difficulties I experienced is what prompted the forwarding of this survey as well. 

My advice to you going forward, let the candidates know when doing the virtual interview, for best results, conduct on a desk or laptop computer. "
"When I received the email to take the survey, I was unsure if I would still be considered for the job position that I applied for. I think some clarification about my application and if it is still being considered, would be very helpful. "
"When I follow up with the JnJ recruiter about the status of a job, they could actually reply to me.  That would be nice.  Unfortunately JnJ's reputation has declined a lot in the last 5 years and I see it is not without merit given my experience with your recruitment process.  "
"When I applied for this position, it was at the Abbott Optical division.  Since then, the division was acquired by Johnson & Johnson (J&J).  Since I have not technically used the J&J recruitment process, I have no input at this time."
"When candidate apply for a position with the company, at least provide some update to the hiring process."
"When being referred by an internal candidate, the way the email confirmation comes in to me to complete next steps is not easy to read, the layout is too busy."
When applying it is nice to know what the application/ hiring process looks like and what can be expected. 
When applying for a positon that you were referred to by an internal employee it would be nice to be contacted personally by a recruiter
"When applicant logs in with unique ID/password, a job status indication tool on careers home page, notifying & granting  applicant visibility if action must be taken on their behalf or not for their job submission.  Additional notification alert via email or text when status changes so individual can login promptly in case to view status."
"When an individual is not deemed a fit for the position it would be beneficial to know why they did not match the position.  Was it education, lack of skill set, etc...."
"When a timeline is given to a candidate for a decision to be made, please adhere to said timeline. Also, a candidate should not have to make calls and emails to find out the result of such (final round) interviews - that should be done promptly by the hiring team."
"When a hiring manager indicates that they are ""moving quickly"", they should give the recruiter feedback to follow-up with candidates quickly. I waited more than one month to hear I wasn't selected but had long since assumed I wasn't and that no one had the courtesy to follow-up. The recruiter was wonderful and did everything in her power to communicate but information needed to be passed along to her."
"When a candidate is referred for a job by an employee of Johnson & Johnson, it would be perhaps be more respectful of a person's time to send a personal email should the candidacy not move forward; instead, I received a sterile form email, which was insulting given the way I was invited to apply for the job."
Whatever you deem important.
"What you are doing with keeping applicants informed or their application. This survey is the first step and hopefully you will continue with this communication process throughout the duration of this application.

"What would be nice is some indication that the resume was reviewed and also to provide some feedback as to where I am as a candidate in the process.  The submission process feels a bit like a black hole.  There is no one to follow up with and I have no way of knowing if I am in the running.  That is my only input to the application process.  Thank you for soliciting my opinion.  Many Kind Regards,  Constance B Ostler"
"What they can do is review my resume and application without prejudice.  Too many times I have submitted my application for opportunities that clearly matched my background, only for it to be automatically rejected by Johnson and Johnson's recruiter process."
"What recruitment process? 

I did not receive any type of notification or status email or call.  I not sure what was supposed to happen but based on this ""recruitment"" process, I am surprised that anyone gets hired. "
"What is the use of posting a job online when after applying for the position there is no feedback - including rejection email or explanation?

I understand that you get hundreds of applicants but one of the key jobs of HR is to communicate with the applicant and not leave him hanging in a vacuum. "
"What I value throughout the application process is to hear back from the company. Even if it's just an automated rejection letter, I would prefer that over not hearing anything at all. "
What i say that johnson & johnson can do to improve the recruitment process would be that after somebody has submitted their application contact them after 3 days for an interview and go from their. I would also say that johnson & johnson should make their applications easier to find and apply for.
"Well, the impersonal way these are carried out really leaves one wondering.  You never hear from anyone, but when you don't make the cut you get an email.  Nothing about why - I am old school and I would love to hear from a person as to why they didn't like me or what on my resume could have made it better for me.  Just some reason!  I didn't make the cut all I got was the email.

But, on a happier note - I did finally get an interview on a position at J&J that  I researched by myself.  I will let you know about that one!"
"Well, since you asked, you are trying to vet your candidates from a mere piece of paper (CE/Resume) You really should take a moment and see who it is you just sent packing down the street. That may take some getting out of a chair however...."
"well, no one was intrested up till now to even give me a call. 22 years working in health field, B2B and management for 7 years. "
"Well, like virtually all companies in the ""Age of the Internet,"" there is a degree of impersonality that in many cases can be--and should be--reduced.  Prompt response to employment inquiries would be a good start; many companies take far too long to express an interest or a disinterest in a candidate."
"Well, if anything, I would say a promptly respond of receive and review of application. Also, if a notification if not selected or the position is not longer available. "
"Well, I think it is a good process.  I really don't have any idea about it , I applied online and I received an email to participate in this survey."
"Well, I never heard back after submitting my application.....So a determination notice of any type would be welcomed."
"Well, I never heard anything from you until I got this survey, indicating that - most likely - I wasn't being considered for the job, despite excellent qualifications and experience.  But I am female and my resume does indicate that I am not a 20-something - if you get my drift.  Maybe workplace diversity needs to include older  females.  "
"Well, I haven't heard back yet on this position and I do wonder about the outcome.  it would be nice to get feedback even when the process has slowed down ....let applicants know what is going on."
"Well, I have not been contacted yet regarding this position yet and would like the opportunity."
"Well, I got a survey before ever receiving any sort of status update on my application. I would say improving your recruitment process order of events would offer a more streamlined, clear experience.

After I got this survey, I tried to login to my application account. Since I forgot my password (its been awhile), I had to try to reset my password and got sent to a broken page :(https://jnjc.taleo.net/careersection/2/http://jnjc.taleo.net/careersection/2/profile.ftl?lang=en&alt=1) I still dont know my status yet you want me to rate my experience? I really wish I could speak highly because I have heard good things about working at johnson and johnson but I have also heard some not so good things about the application process at johnson and johnson. I guess I got to experience it first hand...."
"Well, four weeks after originally posting for the position I still haven't heard anything either way.  While I'm finding this is a fairly normal pace for the hiring process these days, it's frustrating to not know anything about the application at this point.  Some sort of update, perhaps 2 weeks from initial application (even if just ""we're still collecting resumes"") would be great!"
"Well, for this role I did not heard any feedback, can you tell why???"
"Well, for starters, you can communicate with your applicants. I have applied for 2 positions in the last 2 months and not once did I get any update as to what I could expect, etc.  In fact, one position listed all the qualifications, which I satisfied. Only to find out in the interview process - in which I got a call from my HR contact saying I wasnt qualified.......really???? That couldn't have been communicated when I applied? Talk about a complete waste of time and energy.

Also, there is zero talent pool management here......noone gives a shit about my career or developing me - except me. I have contiuously asked for leadership development training and what I could/should be doing to be more visible......and have heard nothing. I feel completely stuck in this role.

Furthermore, when you apply for a position and are not fortunate enough to move on in the process your name disappears from the pool. Someone should be keeping a list of the people for future consideration of other jobs......yet that doesn't happen. Instead, what we see are company announcements for new hires of positions we never new were available. Again, for a company that prides itself on transparency, J&J fails at these very basic levels.

Honestly, I am currently looking to leave this company because of the lack of professional development of people they say they need. It's all lip service. Depuy Synthes does a horrible job managing its talent.......period. These surveys are another example......nothing will come of this feedback.....it's only to satisfy a box someone can check to say they wanted feedback."
Well this is the first communication that I've received since my submission confirmation. I haven't heard back on whether I was being considered or rejected for the role.
"Well it has been some time sense I applied and I believe got an email confirmation immediately after applying but haven't heard anything since then.  I will try emailing using the Talent Acquisition link included in this survey email but this might be an improvement that could be added to the process.  Good communication with the applicant would be great.  Thanks, Nathan"
"Well I haven't heard anything whether I am being considered or not.  I think the only thing I would add is to get notification of how the selection is going, regardless of the outcome.

Thanks
"
"Well I haven't been contacted yet from anyone in recruiting regarding my application, so having someone contact me would be a huge bonus :)"
Well I got this message and don't know if I am still being considered or not. Have not heard anything. 
"Well I applied for this position several weeks ago, and have not heard anything about the position since then.  Would be nice to know what ever happened to my resume & this job."
Well done
Well designed. Timeline for decision process would be helpful.
"Well aside from hiring me? :)

I think it would go along way to have someone let you know why you may have been passed up. I do understand you may have 100s of resumes to scan through on a regular basis. As a former employee who oversaw 25 people, it goes a really long way with an applicant to inform them why they may have been passed up. It doesn’t need to be anything lengthy, but any info helps that applicant moving forward. 

I would appreciate the opportunity to work for search a great company. Lets go Jets!
"
"Well - even though I know I have the qualifications for the position, I did not even rate a telephone interview.  Nothing.  I applied and after a couple of weeks I a rejection notice.  I'm even registered with several staffing agencies - not that it has done me any good.  If you're going to hire from within, why waste our valuable time trying to find a position that you've already planned to fill internally.  It's frustrating and I cannot get back the time I spent applying for the position with your company.

How to make the process better - not sure that you can....."
Welcome the opportunity to interview for this position.  Thank you.
"Website is very difficult to navigate and sign in as a user.

I have not received prompt and consistent replies to jobs that I was not selected for interview."
website is somewhat confusing to find the actual place where applications are filled out; making an account does not give you a job dashboard as in many other company sites
"Website is difficult to access from J&J website into careers

Process is not laid out clearly when recommended by a current employee. Particularly under the password where a specific code needs to be input.

I am still waiting to get an answer regarding my application for Senior Brand Manager role, despite this survey request. It doesn't make sense to not have any communication regarding my job application."
"We will see as the process continues.

We do not get a reason why we do not get to next stage. 
"Waste of time so far applying for anything. Responses are always the same (in the negative and to keep applying for future opportunities) and even in positions where I worked as a contractor at Johnson & Johnson I still did not get the job. Again, a waste of my time."

"Waiting for a response about online job postings is the most stressful part of the job process, so getting a survey about the posting long after applying for the job, but before hearing about the job is possibly not the most effective! "
"Wait until after notification to send this survey!!! I thought I was being contacted about the position I applied for, and to be honest I was very disappointed when I found out it was only a survey! "
Visibility! Once I received the initial email stating that  my application was successfully submitted through LinkedIn I never heard back from the company until today. Candidates like to know where they stand in the process. A quick update would have been a nice touch.
visibility why not a good fit to improve personal and technical skills for personal development

Verify that your systems pull accurate information from resumes. I have applied for some jobs at various companies and this frustrates me more that because of formatting information has to be corrected because it is incorrectly pulled from the resume.

Useful feedback to an applicant not receiving an offer is always helpful.
Use testimonials from employees in the same department as the post. Allow current employee's to post comments for the posting.
Use more recruiting approaches at various universities nationwide to promote awareness of careers offered by Johnson & Johnson
Use less rent-a-reps for sales support. Expand or build upon your integrity sales program to include Challenger sales. Have LTC market place specialist to work with PCP representatives. 
"Use auto fill more effectively since the job market is beyond competitive with hundreds applying for one position, streamlining the process would help."
Use artificial intelegence to distill out information from applicant's resume
"Upon phone screen, give candidates a bright line idea of when they can expect to know whether they are moving forward or not."
"Uploading multiple documents to your profile can be a bit confusing at times.  I wasn't sure if I needed to submit new documents for every job or just one for my general profile. 
The checklist of qualifications was very helpful and intuitive; it is easy to translate skills in the context of the job being applied for."
Upload documentation process flow not as fluid as it could be. Maybe it's the flow of process
Updating the status of application I believe would be useful to applicants to know where they are in the process.
Updates to applicants auto generated when positions are filled.
"Updates on the status of the recruitment process will be nice.  The process is lengthy so, on occasions you wonder if they are still considering you or the process was closed.   "
Updates on the status of the position we have applied for would be helpful
Updates on the progress of the application. 
Updates on the application status would be highly valuable. I only know if you've received the application. I have no idea whether it was even looked at or even a general timeframe for when it will be reviewed and the target date for when the posting will end.
Updates on he status of applications. Keep up the good work!
Updates on applications even wasn't selected. Treating applicants like professional individual will separate the your HR department from the rest.
Updates on application process. 
Updates on application process may be nice. 
"Updated on status of the application or position itself. 
Thank you."
updated info on the position in which someone applied
Update with the application status.

Update possible candidates through the process. 
update our-source so that emails are sent/received when new postings relevant career goals (career objectives and jobs are pre selected in the sysytem) are communicated
Update on timeline. 
"Update on progress of the role, if it has been filled and if applicant is being considered. Or Even inform of potential next steps to help

Update me on the status of my application
Update candidates with the latest on their applications.
Update candidates with hiring progress
Update candidates why they were not selected for a particular role.
Update candidates on where they stand in the recruitment process. I know that is asking a lot as I'm involved with the hiring process at my current place of employment. I would love to work for Johnson & Johnson. 
Update applicants regularly. 
"update applicants on status of their application and probably, give short description of non acceptance so that the applicant can learned and improved"
"Up to this point, its been fairly seamless and user-friendly.  I find the job description and qualifications along with the application process to be clearly defined.  "
"Until the arrival of this survey request, I have received no response or feedback from Johnson & Johnson other than an automated acknowledgment of my application.  My application, it seems, has fallen into a black hole.  If Johnson & Johnson truly wants to improve its recruitment process, it might consider responding to job applicants in a more meaningful manner.

unsure but frequent emails do help. 
Unsure at this time since all I have done is submit an application.
Unsure at the moment. This is my first time applying for an internal position. 
"unsure - as I have not worked there it is difficult for me to asses the internal vs external process. 

Your process is long enough to discourage frivolous applications, but not so long that you discourage serious applicants. "
Unknown at this time 
"Unfortunately, I did not receive any follow-up regarding my CV submission for this position. It would be helpful to receive communication from Talent Acquisition via e-mail to keep the applicant informed of where he or she is in the selection process. "
"Unfortunately, I did not end up applying for this position. I misread the job description, seeing it more as a digital marketing (web/email/video/social media advertising and tracking via analytics) role rather than the software development position it is. I appreciate the opportunity regardless, but I didn't want to continue to waste anyone's time. If the company is ever in need of a Digital Marketing Manager, I'd be very interested in applying.

"Unfortunately, I am extremely disappointed in my experience with this interview process, as I interviewed with the RBD as well as the VP of Sales and Marketing and have still yet to hear an outcome.  I was told I would hear something by 2 weeks ago.  I even followed up with 2 e-mails, and still nothing.  I understand if I was not chosen for the position, but I feel at least a turn down letter should be sent as proper interview etiquette."
Unfortunately I haven't heard anything in regards to my application. Except this survey request. I am looking forward to your decision. Thanks.
Unfortunately I am waiting to hear back for the position I applied so I am unable to comment on the improvement of the recruitment process yet... 
"Understanding that it is time consuming, it would be nice for the applicant to receive a response if not chosen to interview. "
"Understand and take in consideration the past working history with J&J.

May be a better explanation to the job responsibility with description or better examples.  Some of us have been working with J&J several years (15-20) and new technology has been generated to do thing different and better.  During our day to day we keep doing the best we can to let the manages know that we have the potential for grow.  That we still have the initiative to continue learning new thing and keep helping J&J in their goals.  We are part of J&J already.  

I understand that new generation is coming and we must let them been part of the changes.  But, same as they are now we were several years ago.   Not because, we are not part of a new generation mean we cannot accomplish a task.  To me understand, we are sometime in better position, because we have the experience of the past and the enthusiasm to do new things.

It is not our fault to not know several new programs and new technological tools.  This is because we were submersed in the process of keeping the company growing with the tools we have and giving our 100%.
"
"Um I never got an email saying I wasn't a good fit for the job (clearly I wasn't if this is the first I'm hearing from you) and I applied weeks ago, so why are you asking me about the process? Maybe be a little more timely and actually communicate with applicants who apply?  "
"Uh, give me a job!"
"Two thoughts:

1. A indicator of how many applications had been submitted for a position would help the less-qualified save themselves unnecessary trouble in applying for a position that they are unlikely to receive due to the number of applications already received.

2. Give careful, careful consideration to whether a qualification is required or is rather strongly preferred. Applicants are aware that some hiring companies will demand high qualifications but end up taking whomever they can get and thus are tempted to apply for jobs that they are technically under-qualified for but  feel they could perform to expectations. If a requirement is truly inflexible, it may be helpful to job seekers to notate that no exceptions will be made for that requirement.

These features could help save job seekers and hiring managers some time."
Turn around time on getting to me on next steps. 
"Turn around time can be faster, but overall I enjoyed the entire process."
"Trying to be objective on this survey however it seems a questionnaire like this should follow a result or correspondence about the status of the job application.  I hope to hear from your company and further explore the opportunity.

Try to tap large no of candidates
Try to shorten application time
Try to response the candidates as soon as possible.
Try to recruit people from more diverse background. We could be a good element. I have always dreamt about working for JJ and I don't get any call even when I match the position description.
Try to provide more technical support to your online process
"Try to possible improve the pace of the recruitment process. I applied to two positions through a referral and still haven't heard back, i believe it's been almost a month now. "
Try to implement a user friendly interfase.
Try to hear from the candidate. To visualize his personality and feel his energy. Not everything written can give you a better understanding of who is standing in front of you. 
Try to be fair in your evaluations of each resumes. I believe experience heavy candidates bring more real life attributes and overall quality to any position.
try to be accommodating to undergraduate as well as fairly experienced candidates
"Try giving a phone screen at the least to people like myself who aren't able to fit everything into their CV or Resume to learn more about our experience and knowledge rather than sending out automated e-mails based on ""key"" word matches stating ""sorry you will not be considered""

Try and reach out to every applicant regardless of whether they want to move forward with the applicant or not. Some people may really want this position and then never hear from Johnson and Johnson again kind of clueless as to why they did not hear back. 
"Trust in contractors that have the experience, requirements and knowledge of the tasks that the candidate will be performing, because they already belong to the department. Give them the opportunity for an interview. "

Treat the candidate with respect and value the submission.
Transparency of where open role is in progress and speed of closing the loop when the role is filled. I am a former 18-year employee of J&J and love the company. It would be valuable to know when I apply for a role and trigger my internal network where the role is in progress (a % complete) to know how hard to push networking.

I do not remember if I was denied from this position or not but would still like a chance at it. My one concern is that, if I'm not excepted for the position, why would I be reminded a month after I applied?

"
"To whom it may concern;
I feel that J&J does a wonderful job posting their open positions, their position needs, what is expected from a hopeful employee. I also found that if you look hard enough, with the help of social media, you can find out who the hiring manager is and reach out to the individual. I think that for a large company, the only thing that deters a possible wonderful employee is not getting that face to face fast enough. The first impression process is done through an on-line screening process (which obviously helps you weed out someone who is really looking for a career outside of their experience), I would encourage more one on one interaction. Thank you, David Shaak"
"To Whom It May Concern
Perhaps it would be more beneficial for J&J to acknowledge more directly applicants that bring significant experience and high qualifications.
I am a very successful Executive, with a long track record of accomplishments, uniquely qualified to make a significant contribution to any organization; yet, since the date of my application, I have not received even a courtesy phone call, nevertheless an opportunity to seriously discuss my qualifications or experience.
I am applying to this position, only because my current job does not allow me to relocate, so I can be closer to my family.
It is unfortunate that J&J does not make a bigger effort in selecting their candidates based on their respective knowledge, experience and skills.
I still hope to hear from someone in the near future.

"To this point, the only things that have occurred in the process thus far are: (i) the submission of my application; (ii) an email confirmation of receipt of the application; and (iii) this questionnaire.  While there are many more steps still unseen in the Johnson & Johnson recruitment process, the steps accomplished to date have been superbly executed.  I welcome the opportunity to experience and evaluate the entire path, including the job offer and being on-boarded."
"To this point, I consider the job application process very complete.

"To the extent possible, I would recommend following up with all candidates to provide their applicant status, even if there is no interest in proceeding by J&J.  I had applied for this position, and another similar position in November, and besides the automated application confirmation I did not receive communication from J&J until this survey request.  As a former leader of a high volume Recruitment department, I can certainly understand the challenges and resource constraints of contacting all candidates at all stages of the assessment process.  However, most of J&J's candidates are likely either current or future product consumers, and the HR and Recruiting teams can help maintain and elevate organizational reputation and branding by providing status communication to applicants.  Otherwise, I was impressed with the depth of content on the careers page and was very attracted to the credo and values based approach within the J&J organization.  Thanks very much for the opportunity to provide feedback."

The general feeling amongst the intenal team is that preferences are given to friends in the group and skill set is often not a consideration.

"Thus far Johnson & Johnson has done a wonderful and thorough job with the application portion. As I only applied last week, and I am early in the recruitment process, and I would love to provide more feedback once I complete the process in its entirety."
Thus far I've been very impressed. I also appreciate the fact that your company has taken the time to send this survey in the first place. 
"Thus far I have enjoyed the process. I appreciate the survey/follow-up. It shows a concern to do things the right way, and strive to improve. I look forward to speaking further with representatives from the firm in the future."

thought it was easy to navigate and complete.  no changes needed

"Though J&J has very remarkable reputation in the market, my only concern is that I have not received any feedback with any comments about my application which was submitted to J&J through online. Is this supposed to reply applicants with ""yes"" or ""no""? thanks

"
"Though I realize it would be challenging to execute, more communication on the timing/status of the process would be lovely. For example, it has been nearly 6 weeks since I applied for a position with your organization, and this survey is the first communication that I have received since the initial application confirmation. Some sort of touch base every couple of weeks if the process is on-going would certainly set you a part from the marketplace. "
Though i believe the current recruiting process is great some improvements could be made in terms of the timeliness of status updates.
"This week I was rejected for a APQP engineer position in miami fl. The reason,  I am not citizen. I have employment authorization document. I think it is discrimination for immigration reasons. I was very exited for this position but...J&J have to take care for legal immigrants workers! "

"This was my second time applying for a position.  I greatly appreciate the quick turn around in finding out that I was not selected.   However, I am not really confident that 'all' the skills I bring to the table are/were considered to conclude my ability to be successful in the role.  

I feel that ones experiences should be considered.

This was my first interview with JNJ and the recruiter and the process was very professional and friendly.

This was based on submitting a resume as that was as far as I got. Hope it helps!
"This was an internal application. The only disappointing aspect was that I did not receive personal contact to inform me of the decision to offer the position to another person. As an internal candidate, receiving an email that indicates my being turned down for the position after a lengthy application and interview effort does not seem very respectful."
This was a clear and efficient process. 
"This survey was sent to me, but I haven't heard from J&J except the automated email for receipt of my application.  I don't have any idea if I am being considered for anything or if they are not considering me. This is unique to my application with J&J. "
"This survey seems to be design for external candidates... even if Credo values if a very significant element of why I work with J&J, relevance of why I applied for this job is minimal because is already part of my current working context."
"This survey is unfortunately the only feedback so far in the recruitment process I've received... I know things take time, but other than the automated email, I've heard nothing so far."
This survey is the first response I received. Never had any other correspondence regarding the position I applied for.
This survey is administered too early in the recruitment process to provide meaningful information. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you more about the recruitment process after I am further along in the process. 
"This survey is a great start.  As a candidate, I prefer over communication from Talent Acquisition, rather than wondering if my application was reviewed, filtered or still under consideration."
This survey is a good idea. Let the candidate know how long the review process should be.
This site was very friendly and easy to appliy
This really depends on the outcome of the process. It's not a matter of whether I get the job or even an opportunity to interview. My improvement would be to commicate to applicants if they are not going to be considered. It's nice to close the loop.
This process was extremely rushed. Everything moved very quickly so I did not feel like I had time to consider my options.
This process is much better thatn the old one. This a major process improvement

This is the first contact so not sure of the potential process 
This is the first contact received since application.
This is the first communication I've received since I applied 
"This is perfect, continue with this work."
This is one of the smoothest job application processes I have been a part of. I cannot think of anything to improve the process. 
This is one of the few sites that request an aplication feedback. Also an automatic email of application status to applicants will be nice.
"This is one of the best processes I have seen.
As always we would like to have a faster resolution.
Great job!"
This is one of the best and easiest online processes I have been involved with.
"This is not an improvement suggestion, but I really appreciated being able to upload my resume and cover letter directly without having to spend a great dealing of time editing the content/format once it was transferred."
"This is my first time applying for a position at J & J.  
It is always nice to hear feedback as to the position that was applied for.

"This is my first selection process at Johnson & Johnson, but I consider respectful all feedbacks. Help us, candidates in new opportunities. "
This is my first communication after submitting my application for the position.  What are the next steps? 
This is my first application at J&J. I have not yet received further communication  on my candidature. Hence I am not in a position to provide response to this query.
This is difficult to answer based on my making an application online. I may have a more fully-formed opinion if I advance in the process.
"This is a very tricky question for me to answer as I am pursuing a job with your company.  I did, however, hope to hear from someone sooner to find out if my application had been reviewed and if I was even a possibility.  I grew hearing about Johnson & Johnson on a daily basis.  My neighbor if memory serves me correct was a pharmacist with your company in New Jersey.  She was brilliant and her name was Susan Zietels.  She loved her job and I remember admiring her.  

As for this recruitment process, I would love the opportunity to actually meet someone.  I am a people person, I enjoy conversation.  My personality, drive, and enthusiasm is what gets me the sales, not my resume or these quizzes.  I would love to have an opportunity to actually interview for a position.  I would be honored to work for John & Johnson."
"This is a very minor point, but when I received the email asking me to complete this survey, I thought I was hearing back about my application, so I got really excited and then was a little disappointed upon reading the message.  Maybe the email title could be modified to avoid confusion about the content of the message."
"This is a tricky question, but in my opinion I think there is so much talent available that is untapped. I believe the way technology has changed our communication patterns it has also changed the way we learn and adapt to new situations/industries; we learn faster and more independently. In short, an aggressive and fresh learner may be a prime target over a 20 year industry veteran, especially in a digital age. "
This current process is great. Not sure what to change. I was encouraged to bid on the position by a colleague. 
"This company is only collecting the resumes to increase their data base. They never call for an interview,I am applying for many years but I never got an interview call.Its a standard answer ,we can not move forward with your ,,,,
Please stop this and start hiring. Why are you hiring through agency as a temp and no perm job?"
this best company
Think the recruitment process was perfect.
"Think outside the box, search for the 'wow' factor and you will find someone unexpected suit for the job."
Think outside the box when someone such as myself with a different background applies.  Realize that they may have a different perspective and new ideas to contribute to the team!
Think its perfect!
Think it works well.
Things are just fine the way they are.
"They should Request my CV before making a decision to cut me from the list of candidates.  

I just completed a 2.5 year assignment at Jnj with the exact same responsibilities as they are looking fir with this opportunity and I was not considered."
"They should not rely on auto tracking system to choose candidate for interview. I did not have chance for interview. If I got the chance, I am confident that they will hire me since I met all requirements beside the huge qualification that I acquired "
they should help me be a member of your compney 
"They never call OR discuss the job requirements and candidates qualification. Also, it looks like this company is never interested in hiring experienced  candidates.Most of the time when my qualifications met they have a standard reply,"" Due to changing business needs,this position is not required"""
"They need to give more opportunities to Freshers,So that they will work more actively."
They need to contact the candidates. I applied and never heard anything until now.
"They need to be more confident with people and verify first the conditions of the applicant. 
Also not confirm a interview and few day later cancel it."
"They have a quick response time. That is good. Right now, I believe there is no much change I can suggest. Maybe bin a future. "
They did a great job in informing me that they were not moving forward with my application.  This is very respectful and not enough companies do that so thank you.   It would be nice if when you receive a very qualified candidate that you would have a system where you pass the application to others to see if there is an appropriate role in the company other than the position applied for and then a recruiter reaches out.  This makes sense because you want to attract good talent.  Thanks again.
"They deliberate do not consider application other then US .
I am the most suitable for the Director Resins , But my application was straight away rejected without given due consideration may be the person in HR may not know about the subject insight of the Job.
I feel sorry that they are poor in judging the right people."
"They could provide more than a simple - thanks for applying response when they are not interested. It takes a LONG time to put together an application, some more consideration for the applicants would be greatly appreciated. After being so coldly dismissed I doubt I will bother to apply again to J & J."
They could definitely call me and offer an interview:) They wouldn't regret it.
They can work on to reduces time form application to get hire. Thanks!
"They can start by offering more positions for the temporary services to fill, giving more people an opportunity to  broaden their skills, and to become more familiar with the company."
They can increase the range of qualification a candidate req
They can improve their recruitment process by hiring Lorenzo Dingcong. 
They can have more ads and informational sessions .
They can create an FAQ page on their applicant tracking software portal
They can actually respond beyond the automated email. The way the company responds to applicants is a big part of the public image that the company maintains. Not responding after a computerized note is rather disrespectful of the time the applicant took to determine if the position is suitable and if the company is worth working for.
They can actually email you to let you know if you're a fit for the role or send a note confirming that you are not.
They are in stright way in their recruitment process.
They are good
They are doing a great job so far
they all alright to me
They actually hire people like me.
These surveys opportunities are great. I would recommend that candidates be able to complete surveys ongoing during the selection process. 
These surveys are great and I hope they are helpful with management of the recruiting experience.
These surveys are a great tool to capture the applicant's experience and improve the process. THIS question should be on ALL surveys to capture any additional thoughts not covered in questions.
There's not an easy portal like some other companies to check in on the progression of the hiring process.  It would be nice to include that or know when the different stages are ending/beginning.
"There's no reason given for denying an application. My qualifications are certainly strong enough. I have worked with J&J before and had been promoted several times. So I assume there is some age discrimination when considering my candidacy, because I have not been able to even gain an interview.  "
There's just one last thing - hire me for this job! Thank you.
There were some repeated questions on the application form that can me integrated to one
There were layers of login process; it would be great if signing in wasn't too complicated
"There were a lot of questions, which is fine, but I noticed on other sites that before you began the application process, they provided an ""estimated amount of time"" that it would take to complete the process; I thought that was helpful in a very simple way."
"There were a few bugs in the digital application process that were a bit confusing, but overall it was a relatively painless process. "
There wasn't a way to differentiate between being currently enrolled and graduating from an MBA program vs having graduated already.
"There wasn't a clear location to place employee referral information. Once I applied to one position, I wasn't able to modify to add an employee referral reference."
"There was no process, no follow up from company. 
Simply an email stating that I wasn't a right fot for the position, although I have trauma and CMF experience and not to mention, a current employee. 
Didn't seem as though they were interested in really trying to find the right person for the job. "
There was no place to put employee recommendation in the application process.
There was no follow on my candidacy status. The onyl follow up from J&J has been this survey request. 
"There was no feedback on the submission. If my profile does not match the need, there should be a clear communication to that effect which will help me realign with J&J requirements in future.

Thanks
Sateesh Jamakhandi"
There was many technical difficulties with the application process. I had to submit my resume by email and I could only login to my account on Apple devices. 
"There was an issue with submitting my resume and I contacted the help desk for support via e-mail, but never heard back. I ended up clearing my cache and trying again later that day and was able to complete my application at that time. "
"There was a hiccup in uploading resume; I submitted my application, unaware of the issue until later, and as a result, I was unable to add it after submission.  Being able to contact a help desk or tech support would have been a welcome relief.  "
"There was a coding problem with the ""assessment"" within the application process for the Director PMO job application.  When I got to the last question and complete the survey, the link to close the assessment and go back to the application, was dead.  As a result, I believe you may not have received my application for the Director PMO roll too, in addition to this one.  If the link was dead for me, you many not have received it from anyone?  Please let me know if your talent acquisition team needs more infor to trouble shoot this issue.
Very best regards,

"There should be more feedback as to if the company believes the individual is qualified or not for the position. Contact from recruitment or HR personnel would be very useful. 
 "
There should be clear timeline on when a candidate will receive response and feedback on the application 
There should be additional weight/consideration given to existing contractors who have a proven track record in J&J processes and procedures.
"There should be a tracking ability to see where the candidate is in the process. The candidate could log in and see such status as: Application Accepted, Application Rejected (Reasons why), Phone Interview Scheduled, In-Person Interview Scheduled, Job Offer, etc. "
"There should be a prompt update on the application status.  If the qualifications do not match, there should be an alternative position offer in order to complete the application process. This will also create continuity and strengthen recruitment process."
"There should be a fair Interview with candidate to his nearest location. office see the ability, personality, health, age group etc in their interview session."
There seems to be pejudice as I have the experience and qualifications yet I am not being contacted.
There seems to be a void in the system. 
"There really wasn't much to the process.  I was advised that I was referred by an employee of J&J, I applied, I received an e-mail that my application was received, and the next e-mail I received was that I was no longer being considered.  The strangest thing was the e-mail that was sent to the employee that referred me - from the ""progression chart"" in that e-mail, it gave the impression that I was actually interviewed, which I was not, and I never received any feedback as to why I was  no longer considered (too much experience, no pharma experience, etc.)."
There isn't anything that comes to my mind that Johnson & Johnson needs to do to better their recruitment process. I think they have a great system!
There is often some technical issue that I seem to have when applying to J&J jobs. I'm not sure what causes this or whether it is a browser issue but its always somewhat of a challenge. I first noticed this years ago when applying and its the same exact experience.
"There is obvious age discrimination.  You have lost a great opportunity as I am a legend in a positive way and can get into anyone I want and also get them to do what I want.  No one else has the access, the reputation and the acceptance that I do.  Just ask the competitors..........  You lose when you discriminate."
There is nothing to change. The recruitment to precise and to the point. I feel Johnson & Johnson speaks for itself and behind every great product is a great company.
There is nothing that I felt should change to improve recruitment process.
"There is nothing I can think of at this time. I find the process to be easy to follow and concise.  I appreciate the confirmation email about receiving the application, as well as, the one updating me about whether or not I qualify for the position."
"There is no way to track the status of your application on your account. It would be a helpful feature. 
Make sure your ATR is not weeding out qualified candidates..."
"There is no feedback regarding why a candidacy was rejected, understandably. However, you are not providing any opportunity to speak with someone at J&J regarding a position for which I have been clearly qualified. My almost 20 years of successful and awarded experience at Johnson & Johnson would testify to that. I suspect there is an age bias within your review process.  "
"There is no feedback in regards an application what is not good for the individual development and understanding, specially for a J&J employee. The message received is standard and does not contain any feedback, quite generic.

The new messages standards have clearly improved, but the content of the messages does not provide valued information."
"there is no feedback from system that the application was received.  no status update on progress provided either.  Only way to find status is when you receive interview call or rejected email.
Not a good way to handle application bids.  "
There is no communication for internal candidates.  I have yet to hear about this job.
There is need to post jonson and jonson jobs on top online recruitment agency various countries.
There is long periods of time where there are no updates.  It would be great to have some check ins along the way with more timely decisions 
There is liitle communication (or no communication at all) when an application is not succesful.  
"There is an opportunity related to feedback speed, Especially for those who are applying to some position at the same way, should be interesting an formal process to track the progress of the selection process."
"There is an excellent process, but I want to work at the company as quickly as possible"
"There is always room for improvement, however I do not have additional information in order to provide further feedback on the current recruitment process being utilized by J&J."
There is always room for an improvement.
There is always a room for improvement and Johnson & Johnson is making every efforts to stay on the top...This survey is the proof of their efforts. Thanks 
"There is almost no feedback. I have applied for several roles, and have had no feedback at all from about half of these. In some cases the position status is not even updated over time. "
There is a need to improve the website. There seems to be an issue with passwords.  I have spoken with a friend who applied for a position with J&J and she expressed some difficulties signing in to the website.  I had a minor issues with the website initially when it came to signing in because of my password not being recognized.
"There is a glitch in the creation of login credentials.  It has been a while but from what I recall, the system asks for ""User ID"" and then tells you that your User ID is not a valid email address if you do not use your email address as a User ID.
The field should be labeled email address.

Once you figure this part out, the application process was relatively intuitive."
There have been several times where i had sent an email to the human resources person for the respective position and the email was not answered. I know that everone is busy but some kind of response would have been nice.
"There have been a large number of jobs that I have applied for at J&J.  I fit the profiles really well, have excellent background and high marks in quality work, yet every job I get passed over. I was told by a previous J&J that a lot of your jobs are not real at all or you already have someone internally in mind and have interest in external interviews. I will keep trying but if this is true please discontinue because its disheartening to people who actually want a shot at J&J and want to make it the best possible pharma on the market."
There has been no updates or follow up post interview.  
"There has been no feedback whatsoever and no exploration of my unique skills and experience in this role, probably unique within the organisation and I would expect at a minimum an exploration of my skill set. Presumably the position was already given before the advertisment.There is no transparency or feedback or even desire to encourage talent."
There has been no contact or information about my submission or the status of the position you are trying to fill.  I would encourage better flow of information back to the candidates.
There could be a status tracker of the application
There can be long periods of time where no contact is made. Perhaps periodic updates on status might be useful.
"There are two suggestions that I would make. The first is allowing the application to be reviewed in full before final submission. The second is to have a login on the jobs.jnj.com site that allows you to access your profile, including completed applications."
"There are situations that may not be covered. Example:

I completed one year of law school and also passed the CA bar exam. However, I do not have a doctorate. This means I do have a higher level of education beyond a Bacholors degree but there is no option to select such. 

As I stated, an example. The fact that I have this education shows I can think logically and have a skill set beyond that of a 4 year institution."
"There are many dedicated employees that wish to continue serving the company, even after displacement.  While it is understood that the company must make significant changes to stay on course, displaced employees with solid contribution records should be helped to find new positions--it is in both the company's and the worker's best interest."
"There are hundreds of Rutgers alumni who work at Johnson & Johnson, it would be great to connect with their profile in the application process. "
"There are a lot of talented sales reps that would be able to step into a territory and begin making a difference to the lives of patients. I always believe that it is the intangibles that make a rep successful. Unfortunately too much emphasis is put on experience and in this case, experience with an injectable. Due to your screening process, it seems as if candidates are not experienced in the injectable space, they are immediately looked over. I for example have 10 years of successful pharma experience and am confident, would outsell many candidates with injectable experience. If you put yourself in between the patient and doctor, you will never lose. That is my philosophy and by impacting the lives of patients, I have had a very successful career. Essentially what I am stating is to give people a chance who don't always fit your profile. "
"There appears to be two separate portals to submit job applications. I've applied through ""apply now"" on a job posting through jobs.jnj.com, and I've applied through the jnjc.taleo.net. I was unsure as to which portal would submit my application, so I applied through both. This was especially confusing as I did not see my completed submissions in the jnjc.taleo.net portal after applying through jobs.jnj.com. "
Their HR process its awesome to me.
"The whole process has been great.
"
The whole experience was great. Thank you for the opportunity. 
"The Website should be more friendly, I had difficulties to download my resume at the beginning of the process."
"The website is very slow. I received a response back within 24hrs on one role and 2 weeks on another. The quick one was a decline response and the other I am assuming I was a candidate for until the job was diminished. If I was s candidate I could have found another job in the time it took yo get a response. So maybe a ""we are taking a serious look at your resume"" email to keep me interested."
"The website is user friendly. The job descriptions are sometimes contains too many acronyms that are internal and are not familiar to the outsiders.
The job requirements are sometimes too broad and unrealistic. "
"The Website is excellent and facilitates submission of candidate's application in a very user-friendly manner.
"
The website is easy to navigate. Questions are simple and straight forward.  The recruitment process could have more direct live contact with potential employees to let them know where the company is in the process.  
the website interface is outdated and difficult to use.  I am surprised by this.
"The website for application does not seemed to have a ""back"" button at every step. Therefore, it does not allow someone to go ""back"" to the previous page as one may click on the wrong item etc accidentally. "
The way it is already works fine
"The video interview was extremely ""glitchy.""  The program crashed and froze several times.  I had to refresh the browser on five separate occasions."
The video interview process would be much more convenient if it allowed mobile capability. Issues with my PC microphone delayed my submittal by several hours.
"The video interview process was set up well, however, my connection was confirmed as ""Good"" but the recordings cut off my responses, regardless of timing and pauses."
"The video interview process should be improved because it kept freezing and I had to keep on trying which was very frustrating and put me off my stride. Would not want to go through that again. Not an encouraging sign and the frustration puts a question mark and dampens the original interest and enthusiasm for the job. On a scale of 1 - 10, I rate the video interview experience a 1"
"The value of recruiting reputation, Focus on top performers and Keep analyzing the improvements and developments. 
"
The turn around time from application to actually getting hired is entirely tooooo long. I had a phone interview from an outsourced recruiter only to be told that if they want to move further then I will be contacted by a JNJ HR recruiter for another phone screen then if the hiring manger wants to pursue my candidacy any further I will then have another phone screen and after which if the hiring manager wants to continue consideration I will be invited for a F2F interview.  By that time I should be hired by Christmas of 2018.
The timeliness of the process is a little slow
"The time taken to process application is long to a point, the applicant is not sure whether the application is being processed, rejected or not.

Timely feedback on the status to the applicant will greatly affect the perception."
The time from when an application is submitted there is really no contact or status updates regarding application status. It would be really useful to get and email advising if the candidates meet or do not meet the requirements for the position or some sort of notifications of application status. 
"The Taleo system used in the internal ""Career Opportunities"" site is somewhat antiquated. Would recommend a newer & more comprehensive search system."
The system was easy and straight forward.  
"The system should have the ability to include the resume in the same electronical application, not by a different source. This should accelerate the hiring process. Electronically, the applicant information should be accessed directly to the hiring manager and/or HR recruiter to determine applicant elegibility."
"The system is very good and easy to follow to apply. Great company reputation one of the best ones. 

Thanks
 "
The survey is good.  But it would be nice if the candidate also gets some kind of a notification letting them know if they still have a chance.
"The submission of online resumes could interface automatically with resumes submitted to other job boards (i.e. Indiana Career Connect, Indeed.com, etc.). Other than that suggestion, the application process is straight-forward and not overly cumbersome."
"The subject line of the survey email had me excited that I was being asked to interview, when I was actually being asked to take a survey.  Possibly change it to ""We'd like your feedback"".
Besides that the process works well and doesn't need improvement."
The steps have been very intuitive and clear throughout the process up to this point.  I feel that a more easily identifiable area on your website that allows you to sign in and track the progress of the application would be beneficial.
The status of recruitment process should be reached in the Johnson & Johnson HR website instead of HR representative contact by phone or email.
The staff career opportunities site is not aesthetically pleasing and felt as though it's from the 90s. Couldn't it be merged with the existing external recruitment portal?
The simpler the filling
The setup for the application page was a bit confusing and required a great deal of processing power from my computer that made it very slow. otherwise it was a good set of questions and I thought it had potential to be very efficient.
"The search was not very intuitive and also the server was down freezing my application for over 24 hours. I checked the web site for a call-in number for some advice and there was no cue to connect with anyone for recruitment.
Opportunity for improvement."
"The search function does not always provide all listings that meet the inputted criteria.  For example, searching for postings by location does not always provide all listings associated with that location."
"The search capabilities of the external site is much more distinct and provides more specificity than that of the internal site.  Thus, I will use the external site to conduct more specific search (i.e. 'remote' 'analytics' '50%' travel etc.) producing more applicable search returns.  Then, I would use the job title to look it up in the internal system and submit my application.  It would be helpful if we could specify the state /province /city as a location; field base, remote, work from home selection would be perfect. I tried with ' '  % wild cards,as in SQL, and did have some success. Thank you for taking time to review my comment.  hngo5@its.jnj.com"
"The Screen procedure of application. I applied for number job roles. But i receive the email stating that not consideration. 
I am having global experience with high technical stuff with Patent filled. My profile and experiences matches with job role perfectly then also it happens. For that i feel there should be procedure for technical evaluation. 
Most of the industry feel as my profile is overqualified. I do not think that the J and J will have that issues. 

Request you to look this aspect 
 "
"The rumour out there is that the jobs posted aren't really available.  From my own personal experience as a consultant, that seems to be true. Multiple recruiters trying to fill the same position. No response to applications, yet I get a request to complete this survey.  The last job I interviewed for I was such a good fit that I have yet to digest the reason given for not getting the job.  Several other positions have been eliminated ""due to changing business needs"".  Internal employees seem to be facing similar issues, so there's no hope for external applicants."
The role is posted on well regarded and highly visible job boards so it should invite a lot of interest. I assume that Johnson & Johnson has the resources necessary to attract top industry talent.
The role and skills needed for the job was well explained. Since there is always room for improvement. The questionnaire in the recruitment process can be shortened. 
The resume submission process is the easy part.  I suggest sending this survey after a candidate completes the interview process.
"The resume can never say everything about a person.  If you do not already, I suggest conducting phone screens.

"
"The responsibilities for the job were described well and the application process was also simple. Since this is my first experience for recruitment in United states, my understanding of the process is limited.
Thank you "
The response time was a little long with no feedback. It would  be nice to get feedback either on the recruiting site or via email of the status as it progresses.
"The response time should be improved. It was a tedious process to even find this opportunity. Waiting for weeks to hear about the position make you lose faith in the company. If there is a posting perhaps a time frame of when the position is looking to be filled by. Also it's very automated human interaction is also great for qualifying canidates. 

Thank you"
"The response time is very slow.  When I apply I do not hear anything for a long time, even if it is a rejection.  "
The requirements were clear and the wording made sense. Potentially something to improve the process would to be allowing the applicants to take a survey and see how their morals or beliefs align with the company's. I think that would provide both the applicant and you all with valuable insight.
"The reputation of Johnson & Johnson is one that follows the company through all touch points, including job recruitment.  Applicants that apply are exposed to the brand/reputation and the expectation is high, as a result of J&J's years of upholding high standards, image and products.  The high standards should be maintained through all touch points.  Specifically, if an applicant takes the time to apply to a job and submit a letter, he/she should be informed on an approximate timeframe for the total evaluation process (as in J&J will be notifying applicants who made the next round by XXX date); in addition, some type of transparency should exist around next steps (it often feels like applying to a job online is like shooting into a black hole); and, candidates should be notified once the role is filled.  Whether it be an opt-in function via email, or status notification, some type of follow up or final notice should be provided. "
The replies feel very computer generated making one feel as if they weren't really considered or their resume wasn't even looked at.  Otherwise I like that you can sign up for alerts on new job postings. 
The regions are not always listed per correct region/state.
The referral application link did not work. I have been in contact with recruiting and IT support several times in order to submit an application. 
The recruitmentment process for Johnson & Johnson has been a very positive experience. I don't think Johnson & Johnson could do anything better. I have an even greater admiration for the company. 
The recruitment process would be improved by email status updates on the progress of the review of my application.
"The recruitment process was very straight forward, and the online application was easy to complete.  "
"The recruitment process was very professional and clear to follow with the step-by-step guidance for the submission, yet the additional survey was a clever way to understand the candidates better. I do appreciate that the recruitment team from Johnson & Johnson to spend efforts to design a complete progression. Thank you!
"
The recruitment process was very good and I can't think of anything  else. 
"The recruitment process was very favorable, I appreciate email notifications when the application was received. If only I received more feedback after my application was processed. I am not sure where I stand in the application process and I applied to the position about a month ago. I know the hiring process can be lengthy so I do understand. "
the recruitment process was very efficient and timely
The recruitment process was very easy to follow and I look forward to hearing back from a recruiter in the near future.
"The recruitment process was seamless and very straight forward.  I found it very easy to input all fields necessary to complete the submission.  

The only improvement I would recommend is to hire me:)"
The recruitment process was more thorough than similar-sized companies.
The recruitment process was great. The only thing that I would like is to get the update status of the position that was applied for. 
The recruitment process was fine. No real issues come to mind.
"The recruitment process was fine 
I can not work 3rd shift that why I move away for this job. I like J&J and would like to work for this company.

The recruitment process was fairly easy.
"The recruitment process was effortless and easy to navigate on the  Johnson & Johnson website. The application process was easy to use and understand. 
At this time I don't believe any improvements should or can be made.
Thank you!
Christine Ricci Crilley"
The recruitment process was easy and intuitive. Every step along the way was a positive experience. There is nothing more that I could add. You have this well orchestrated.
The recruitment process was easy and intuitive.   
The recruitment process thus far has been extremely insightful in accessing hiw a candidate's skills and abilities aligns with the key components of the opportunity. 
The recruitment process thus far has been effective and enjoyable. Perhaps allowing candidates to sort by region/map when looking at job openings? Otherwise the process is great!
The recruitment process seem simple and clear to use.
"The recruitment process needs to be more transparent, it feels like you submit your resume into a black hole and never hear back. The candidates need to be communicated too with regards to either them being selected or not, either way."
The recruitment process needs to be improved to follow up with the right candidate whose qualifications fit with the requirements of the position. Thanks
The recruitment process needs no improvement. It is my believe that all is well.
"The recruitment process may be based on company's standard operating procedure (SOP), making the recruitment process faster will make good improvement."
"The recruitment process looks matured. The only suggestion that I have to improve applicant experience would be to add following metrics
1. Average processing time at Johnson and Johnson
2. Average processing time for this or similar roles at Johnson and Johnson

"
The recruitment process is working. The J&J (AMO) HR Talent Acquisition specialist has been doing a great job in communicating with me throughout the process.
The recruitment process is working properly; I wish I could get an interview so I could showcase how my experience could help Johnson and Jonson be better at what it does. 
The recruitment process is well thought and easy to navigate. 
The recruitment process is very professional.
The recruitment process is very good. I cannot think of a way to improve the recruitment process.
"The recruitment process is terrible.  As an individual who performs in the top 10% of my current organization, i am stunned that I have not even been called for a preliminary screening.   I have achieved 8 out of 10 or higher in my past 6 performance reviews but cannot penetrate the J&J recruitment process.   "
"The recruitment process is straight forward and easy to follow. 
Overall, it is a very good process. "
The recruitment process is somewhat frustrating.  For executive level hires (including counsel) a process that allows direct contact with recruiters would be helpful and less sterile than the process feels at present.
The recruitment process is similar to other companies in regard to the posting and application process.
"The recruitment process is really good, but if the candidates are provided with a feedback about their profile then it would be really better for the candidate to apply for the future opportunities with Johnson & Johnson."
The recruitment process is pretty clear and concise. 
The recruitment process is perfect & no change is required.
The recruitment process is intuitive. The follow-up correspondence is best when favorable and when moving forward in the process for employment. I look forward to a favorable response from HR towards moving towards hiring and on-boarding as an employee.
The recruitment process is good!
The recruitment process is flawless. I just hope that entry level positions are considered because I would love to work for this company in any role that would fit me.
"The recruitment process is fine.  My disappointment that I have for companies like Johnson & Johnson is when someone like me that has 24 years of Training and knowledge management background with proven success is discarded without a second look because I do not have a bachelors degree.  My skills and experience have taken me far in my career so I was surprised and hurt to receive an automated decline less than 24 hours after applying.  

I would have hoped that my resume would have at least qualified for an actual person to review it. "
The recruitment process is fairly seamless. It would be nice to hear from the HR dept weekly to see if you are still a consideration for the position for which you've applied. Sometimes you can go for 2 months without hearing anything.  
"The recruitment process is currently very smooth and transparent but i will also appreciate if as a candidate we can get to know the status of application as and when updated. Also, if we could not crack the opportunity then atleast let us know the shortcomings so that improvise as a person and create value later."
"The recruitment process is clean & clear.It's effective ,easy to apply ,and reply procedure is gentle even they are not accepting your application."
"The recruitment process in my opinion is awful.  Many times the site is not operable. I believe I have good skills sets and I never make it to an interview.  I have had phone screenings.  I've tried so hard for 5 years to begin my career with J&J.  I'm discouraged, but I keep trying.  The calls I did receive were from contracted recruiters, could not call back, missed appointments for phone screenings, and then their assignments were complete and they were no longer involved.  Seems like a lot of turnover in HR in Raynham site.  I attribute this as part of the problem.  Would love an opportunity with J&J, but I'm feeling more and more that this is too difficult.  I just want a chance at a face to face interview.   "
"The recruitment process has gone extremely well.  I have completed a phone screening last week and will be doing a face to face interview on Monday.  I want to be a part of the Johnson and Johnson family.  I have no doubt my background, passion and skillset is a perfect fit.  The opportunity to be part of your family would be an honor, one that I would not take lightly."
"The recruitment process has been seamless thus far - thank you! I think it is wonderful that you have a survey to better understand and improve the process from the perspective of the applicant. I have one, minor, comment about the first question in this survey, which is only meant to be helpful (I work in data management and design). Question number one is written as a leading question. For example, in order to have a more neutral question, question one could read: ""To what extent, if at all, did each of the below...""  "
"The recruitment process has been interactive and intuitive. Its easy to submit a job application, get information about current status and informative about next steps.

"
The recruitment process has been fine. I would only add a field for candidates to enter the name of the current Johnson & Johnson employee who referred them to the position they are applying for. Thank you!
The recruitment process has been as streamline as possible. 
The recruitment process for Johnson & Johnson is fine
The recruitment process for Johnson & Johnson is comparatively better than the already high expectations I had for this company.
The recruitment process for Johnson & Johnson is already seamless.  It continues to be user-friendly by staying current with available hiring/recruitment trends.  
"The recruitment process for J & J, in my opinion, is precise and thorough. Everything was outlined clearly to me. I did not come across any vagueness while completing my application. "
"The recruitment process flowed very well.  It provided ample opportunity to learn more about the company, position, people and culture.  All parties involved were very knowledgeable, helpful and professional."
The recruitment process does not need any improvements.
"The recruitment process as is is fine.  No improvements are required at this time.  

Thank you!"
"The recruitment officer left a message on my voicemail and never called back. She also did not answer any of the phone calls and messages I left, three (3) in total. Making me wonder why.

I suggest that recruiters be mindful of the people they are contacting. If perspective employees don't pick up on the first call, it would be nice if they would follow through with the process and at least respond to a call back, or two, or three."
The recruitment is streamlined very well so no suggestions at this time.
The recruiting time and process can be improved by creating responsive time to respond to the applications. This will create a positive and favorable image for the company. 
The recruiting process is well managed. Johnson & Johnson should continue the good work. 
"the recruiting is still in application step, why need do survey now?"
The recruiting department needs better communication.  I heard nothing from anyone about the position I applied for.   Very disappointing process.
The recruiters could keep better contact with internal candidates and keep them more up to date with the status of their application. 
"The recruiter working on this has not gotten back to me.  I have emailed him (Kevin Turnbach) 2 or 3 times and still no response.

In our first scheduled phone call, he never called me.  I had to send an email to him in order to ask for re-scheduling.  After we finally were able to discuss the position, he recommended that the hiring manager get in contact with me.  I still have not heard back on this.  I am not sure if he contacted the hiring manager and they are not responding."
The recruiter should call to discuss the timeline for the hiring process.
The recruiter should be more responsive to questions and more engaging in possible roles. There needs to be more transparency throughout the process and more feedback given.
The recruiter did not get back to me after the initial phone interview and they recommended me to the next step. I have enquired about the status and have not gotten any feedback. I have waited for few weeks now and still no communication. This reflects so badly on the company and I would not consider applying for opportunities at J&J.
"The recruiter and I both agreed that I would be a perfect fit for this position. Unfortunately, I would have had to move to the East Coast. I had to withdraw my spplication. This position should be offered remotely. J & J is missing out on great talent. "
The questions asked in the skype interview could be better/more relevant. 
"The questions asked in the application process were either a yes or no answer and in some instances will not provide a true indication of the applicant's potential. An example was the question ""Have you published in an high impact journals?"" My answer for this is no, however I am in the process of submitting a paper to a high impact journal. So the yes/no answers are restrictive in finding potential employees who may be on there way to publishing. "
"The questionnaire is a good idea, but maybe it would be better served when the process is over. Is the process over because feedback is key to any process. "
"The question above is meaniless without knowing in what context you are asking it.  I like the products, however, I never heard a word about my application so from that perspective I view your organization unfavorably. "
The prompt imitation of contact after being referred is impressive. The job listing clearly outlines requirements and expectations.
The prohibition against skipping grades is unfair and arbitrary.  It should be removed.
"The process, or at least as far as I got in it, was reasonable; when it was determined that I was not a fit for the role, I received an email.  That was a better than most companies do.  I have no issues with the process."
"The process, as it stands, is comprehensive and not difficult.  I found your posting through Indeed.com and applied on the J&J careers webpage.  I look forward to hearing from someone!"
"The process went well and no improvement is needed based on my experience. Even though I was not considered a fit for the position I was impressed that you did contact me to advise me of such. Most companies do not. Hope this helps.

Thank You"
The process went smoothly for me. 
The process was very streamlined and simple.  I had no issues.
The process was very straightforward. No improvements needed.
The process was very smooth.  It would be nice if there was a timeline when candidates would be contacted by a recruiter for the position.
The process was very simple and easy. No need to improve. 
"The process was very simple and easy to complete. It would be great to have timelines as to when the job posting is closing, when J&J would be contacting persons of interest, and also if the job has been filled. I haven't heard back since the application was accepted into the system/company. So, some follow up with applicants would be favourable. "
The process was very intuitive and streamlined. The job description was very precise and clear.  One of the best job application experiences I have ever had for this stage of the recruitment process. Thank you.    
The process was very intuitive and quick!
The process was very intuitive and I look forward to exploring Johnson and Johnson opportunities further.  Thank you.
"The process was very impersonal, I understand you may get several applicants, yet there was just a standard rejection with no specific reason called out, which leaves the applicant with nothing to work on improving.  I personally have worked in pharma for 2 decades and have even been a Clinical Science Liaison, this position was definitely below my abilities, yet I just got the standard rejection that you found another candidate that better fit the requirements - how about a reason why I didn't fit the requirements?  You can't improve what you don't know.
I would recommend some level of personal contact - even an email that offers a personal explanation as to why an applicant wasn't chosen."
the process was very impersonal and recruiters took months to reply to postings. This can be easily fixed with timely responses (preferably by people). 
"The process was very good, and the phone interview with the Talent Acquisition staff was also very good, professional, polite and informative."
The process was very clear. 
The process was user friendly on line. Great ! Thank you.
The process was streamlined and user friendly. 
"The process was straightforward.  Provides a Johnson & Johnson overview, a clear description of major responsibilities, and a list of qualifications.  What would be a suggestion is to include a salary range to provide applicants  with a pay scale and list some benefits."
The process was straightforward.
"The process was straightforward, in my opinion. As for the preliminary stages, the J&J process follows industry standards. I would/will have more to add once I speak with a member of the recruitment team.

Thank you."
The process was straightforward and seamless. Thank you for opportunity to provide input. 
"The process was straight-forward, intuitive and engaging.  "
The process was straight forward and easy to navigate.
The process was smooth. Hope to get an opportunity to work with the company 
The process was quick.
"the process was overall easy to follow and accurate with good instructions. However, the Yale form for completion of section one could use more clear instructions as to what is required. Also with Yale, if there are any limitations as to file types which can be uploaded, this should be indicated."
"The process was nice and easy, the user interface design is one of the best I'vd used for a job application. I wouldnt improve the process anymore, I believe its already one of the bests."
"The process was long , perhaps shortening the process."
"The process was helpful in that it provided a very good description of the required skill set for the position.  The one area i think could be improved upon is an added human touch to the process.  Particularly for a position like this. 
 
I have found that Private equity is very much a relationship business.  Having raised capital for private equity firms in the U.S  and  Europe, competed against and invested private equity capital in consumer and general industrial companies as well as serving as Vice Chairman of an industry association; getting into the better Funds and deals requires a personal touch.  

My hope and desire is not negatively critique your process but to enhance it.  I remain interested in the opportunity at J & J.  I believe someone with my background and experience could bring value to your existing program.

Wishing you all the best,

Michael "
The process was great. 
The process was great I wouldn't change a thing. 
The process was fine.  I wouldn't change anything.  My only concern is that I haven't heard back regarding my application!!! 
"The process was fairly simple and intuitive. I would only recommend that J&J communicate with each and every applicant, even if not selected to proceed in the selection process."
"The process was easy, quick and straight forward. Thank you."
"The process was easy and simple, I don't think you need to change anything"
The process was easy and intuitive.
The process was easy and instructions complete 
The process was accessible and easy to follow
The process was a good experience but I have not heard from anyone as to the status of my application.
"The process to apply for the position was very slow.... I reckon should be ""not simple"" but a little bit faster, each screen was showing only one question, probably it will be better if had more questions in the same screen. 
All other affects was great and clear . Thanks "
"The process thus has been user friendly. Easy to navigate online posting and enjoyed the conversation with interal staffing. My positive perception of the organization as a great place to work and build a career was further established in our dilaouge. 

When situations allow a more prompt process is always productive for the company and candidate.  "
"The process takes too long and many times I do not hear back from you if I was selected or not since the beginning of the process. As far as the role description, I think it will be better if you separate the ""required qualifications"" from ""optional qualifications"". Here is an example of an ""X"" role: 

""Required qualifications
•  Bachelor’s degree
•  At least five years’ experience in which managing client relationships was the primary responsibility
.
.
.


Optional Qualifications (Experience in at least two of the following):
- Leadership experience with teams of 10+ members
- Knowledge of FDA regulations
- Experience running enterprise software deployments
.
.
.

I hope this helps!!!

PS. As far as working with J&J is my top priority because of your culture and career progression. I hope I can someday work for your company someday!!
"
The process so far has been relatively easy. If I continue through the process than I can provide meaningful feedback.
"The process so far has been great.  The application online was quick.  I've had a phone screen with HR and I'm currently waiting for a call back regarding an additional phone screen with the technical team.  I look forward to hearing from J&J!

Thank you,
Joe Fonseca"
The process should keep the candidate more in the loop of the hiring/interview process. 
The process should be quickly.
"The process seems to be very intuitive so far.  I am only to the middle of the process (interview tomorrow).  

I've seen other companies not really close out the application process and keep the applicants holding on for hope for over a month.  If the application process tool were mine to develop.  I might have applicants sign into my website and visually show the start, middle and end.  This way there would be no confusion on the applicant side.  If an applicant would fall just short, (#2 pick) to a job fill I would proactively alert them for the next similar position.

The goal of HR is finding the most talented people around.  Talented people do not stay available for too long.  So a streamlined process or system to minimize wait times, confusion, and increase certainty is in every company's interest.  "
"The process seems quit sound, however with major multinationals it is difficult to make the interaction more Personable.  Perhaps some type of interactive portal for the prospective employee provide a short introduction / 90 second elevator pitch for adding value for the desired role."
The process seemed generic no matter what type or level of role being considered.  It would be nice to have a slightly more tailored process. 
The process of recruitment with Johnson & Johnson is consistent with other major organizations I have applied to for employment.  I don't have any additional suggestions to make.
"The process of recruitment is routine, but to get the best candidate, one should consider the education as well as experience as evaluation criteria. "
"The process of identifying and selecting an ideal candidate can be tedious and daunting task for recruiter and hiring management team, however, timely feedback or a simple acknowledgment that the vetting process is still ongoing, next steps or no longer in consideration notifications can go a long way to the employer branding and are much appreciated by the potential future employee."
The process of filling out the application is a bit tedious because most of this information is captured in a resume. There seems to be some redundancy here. 
The process of completing new hire paperwork is confusing.  Having the contact that is handling paperwork not available by phone is not efficient and frustrating. 
The process of applying was very simple and straight forward. Thank you.
The process is very smooth for such a large company. More transparency with where the application is in the process may benefit candidates but isn't necessary. 
"The process is very slow, also I applied for multiple positions for some I got rejected; but in that email there is no position description, I have no idea for which role/position I have been denied just a generic email was sent by J&J recruiting team. Rest of my applications I havent heard back on, it been 3 weeks, no yes or no which is very disheartening from a company like J&J "
The process is very reasonable.
The process is very professional.
The process is very good!
The process is too automated and you could miss the opportunity to consider candidates who could be excellent employees.
The process is smooth and detailed.
The process is quite smooth and is much better designed than other application processes with other big pharma companies.
The process is quite slow...it should be fast
The process is just starting for my feedback to be worth something. I don't really have a position on the subject at the moment. 
The process is great so far. 
The process is good as is. LinkedIn and Indeed are useful. Universities are great sources as well.
"The process is good and would only add that feedback should be faster.
Thank you."
The process is fine.
The process is fine
The Process is fairly good I personally don't think there is much to change 
The process is fair and representative. I do not think there is any reason to change
The process is fair and efficient.  Hopefully the process includes me being added as a new hire. 
The process is extremely efficient.
The process is excellent.
The process is easy and straightforward. 
The process is among the most simple of many that I have used. A potential timeline for applicants would be a nice feature.
The process is already very good!
"The process is adequate. Anything to speed up the process would be beneficial from the candidates perspective. Many companies are only requesting a resume and cover letter (for the most part) to apply. A streamlined process should result in a higher ratio of applicants.

Thanks,
Rich Asciutto"
"The process is a bit lengthy and I received another offer during the J&J recruiting process. Overall, the recruitment process was excellent. It was nice to have a recruiter dedicated to the position as a contact."
The process has to be one of the best in the industry. 
The process has been very user friendly.  I look forward to speaking with the recruitment team in the near future. 
The process has been very positive up to this point.   I hope to see periodic status updates as my candidacy progresses.
"The process has been very organize, I received a phone call to schedule a phone interview with Ms. Mireica Marrero. I had my phone interview on February 28, 2017 at 10:00 am. The interview was really smooth, friendly and I got an overview of the position I am applying for (Key Account Specialist). I had the opportunity to discuss all the expertise I can bring to J&J.  I hope to be part of the J&J family very soon. "
"The process has been very fast and clear so far. Every individual involved looked well prepared and organized for the interviews. First impression of the company is excellent! I like the fact that cultural fit was assessed. 

Thank you"
The process has been seamless heretofore. 
"The process has been seamless and very pleasant.  The application, on line, was not a burden to complete.  The follow up mechanisms have been timely. "
The process has been quite professional. No comment at this point.
The process has been fast and efficient thus far.
"The process has been easy to follow.  It would have been nice to receive this survey sooner so I could provide fresh feedback.
"
"The process has always seemed to be biased into pre-id resources to fill in the roles. Honestly, If I get in the process will be appreciative, but I've been in previous processes and hasn't seem to be transparent."
"The process for recruitment was very well placed together. Only wished J&J would have hired me for any of their open position.

Thank you,
Mr. Joseph Fish"
The process for applying was very easy. I would like the opportunity to talk with the recruiter about my background and experience in the industry.
"The process does not provide any feedback, which would be very helpful for future openings. My qualifications seemed to match well, if there is something else that I can do or some other trainings that would make me a better fit, I would like to know about them."
"The process can be improved by taking the time to speak with the applicat for the applicat too careful consideration and time to consider applying for each position, the keast HR could do is to have a 5 minute conversation with the appilicant.  Sometimes it would be best for tue hireing manager to see appilcants who highly qualify rather than a computer software or HR.  There are many more factors that cannot be expressed on a resume after all you don't hire a peice of paper there is a real person behind the words on a page. i've never got a call back on any application submitted yet I work as a contractor now at one JnJ OpCo."
"The process can be approved by interacting with LinkedIn more. Once you apply via this portal it should automatically upload to the Johnson and Johnson portal without requiring a log in. 

Also, I have been qualified for the positions I have applied for in the past and have not received an interview. This would suggest that internal or global candidates are considered over local candidates. 
I currently work remotely and would like to continue to do so. 

Respectfully submitted "
"The process appears to be working fine for me, thus far."
The process appeared to be appropriate.
The posting was taken down rather quickly and I'm uncertain if it is still open. I'm also still waiting to confirm if recruitment is currently taking place or if the posting has been filled.
The possibility of being considered.  To receive a notification if not accepted for the position.
"The position was put on hold, the recruiting process was not able to provide that level of information "
"The position was posted, but after I applied I believe the response was that it had been decided to terminate the position. I never got a clear explanation of what had actually happened. "
The position was posted and then cancelled. 
The position was found on Indeed.com.  Loved the application process.  I was highly impressed that I could just submit a resume and not have to reiterate career and education experience over and over again.  Best application process I have seen. 
The position description mentioned was apt. The job role for a technical position can be more specific.
"The position and requirements were clearly stated.
The application process was user friendly, thorough and concise.
Your recruitment process provided clear employment expectations in order to ensure a successful team fit.

Respectfully submitted,

"The phone interview process is valuable. It keeps both company and candidate from wasting their time. However, I don't think it is a good practice not to inform the candidate of their status. It has been over 3 weeks since the phone screen and I have no idea if I am still considered a candidate or not considered a candidate. 
As a candidate, I am actively looking for new career opportunities. At a minimum, some feedback as to company interest is imperative and is reflective of mutual respect. I have to say I don't feel very positive about Johnson & Johnson considering after 3 weeks there's been no feedback. Best regards. I hope this helps with your process."
"The page takes forever to load, and I had to attempt login multiple times through different browsers at different times per day till I finally got it to work."
"The pace of the process is very slow, and the communication on next steps &/or closure is also very slow."
The overall process so far has been excellent 
The overall application process is user-friendly. It would be good for candidates to receive confirmation on whether they have been selected for further consideration or not.
The original position I applied for (Forensic & Compliance Associate) was cancelled. Little to no follow up as to why or if it would repost. This was also a month after applying. 
"The option to create a candidate profile is of great value.  If application process would be improved if there was a way for candidates to receive an automated, second notification when the hiring manager viewed their respective application/credentials.  "
The opportunity to work close my family!
The opportunity of comunicate with candidates. With in the selection process to determine which candidate move forward.
"the oportunity for the people,to see talent, and quality effort"
The only way I can think to improve is if I landed the Sales Rep job I applied for.  
"The only thing that would have made it more clear would be to have clear definitions of terms like ""casual part-time' (aka = 19.5 hours/week). When reading the job description, it was unclear as to whether this was a half-time position, or if part-time meant something else, like 10 hours per week or 30 hours per week. The terminology might be crystal clear in-house, but open to interpretation for a jobseeker coming from outside the company."
"The only thing that I might suggest, which is minor, is that the talent acquisition team send applicants status updates on the positions that they have applied for. You inform applicants if the position has been filled or put on hold, but in cases where the position remains open for a long period of time, it would be appreciated if status updates were sent. "
The only thing that could be clarified is he exact territory map.
The only thing J&J can do better is hire me
"The only thing I would change in the process is in the announcement. It does not specify what type of Aircraft J&J flies. 
 Where I have an abundant amount of experience in Gulfstreams, if J&J is flying Falcons or some other type aircraft, I would probably not have applied.  "
"The only thing I wasn't a fan of was not having face to face interviews and using WebEx, I didn't feel comfortable over webcam. That being said I realize that with the progression of technology that interviewing over videoconference will become more and more prevalent, so I am happy to get some experience in that interview format. "
The only suggestion would be to make candidates aware of when you'll close the application process for a role. This would allow the candidate to know when they could anticipate hearing someone further either way.
"The only suggestion I would make is to eliminate repetition in the process. Resumes include work history and education, no need to ask questions regarding either."
The only suggestion I have: reply back to candidates after receiving their resume to provide confirmation of receipt as well as the status. I.e. I submitted my resume two weeks ago and haven't received confirmation or contact from anyone at J&J about the position. But I have received three emails about taking a survey. 
"The only suggestion I have right now is with the new ""Next Step"" page for internal applicants. I do not like the new search feature. You are not able to search by location or narrow down the search very much. The old search was nice because you could leave the search open and get many results, or you could narrow it down to a specific site and area of work."
"The only recommendation I have would be to possibly make the name of the recruiter available with the job posting. 
Thanks!"
The only part of the recruitment process that I have experienced was filling out the application. I do not feel I can make a fair assessment at this point.
"The only improvement thus far might include correspondence regarding where my candidacy is at in the process, what next steps may look like and a rough timeline. The on-line application interface was user friendly and went well. I look forward to hearing back regarding my candidacy and next steps.
"
"The only improvement that I would suggest, would merely be to try to respond in a more expeditious practice to the candidates that do apply for any position."
The only improvement that I would make is to send an e-mail out to perspective candidates to let them know where they stand in the employment process. This e-mail can be computer generated.
The only feedback I have would be to show the status of the application in the Taleo system other than that it is complete. 
The only feedback I could offer would be to perhaps keep the applicant informed as they are moved through the process. Maybe you do that to applicants that are chosen for interviews and I'm just not one of them :-) 
The only feedback I can give is that sending this survey without any news about my actual application is really confusing. I don't know if this means I'm not longer being considered for the posting or if it's unrelated.
The only advice would be to have the search function easier to use. The filters are not easy to use. 
The online recruitment process was straight forward and I received an instant email to confirm receipt of my application. It has been 2 weeks since the submission date so it would be good to have an update on the the process if possible although I appreciate the role is still active. 
"The online recruitment process so far, has been seamless, intuitive and smart.  "
The online recruitment process is a black hole.  I don't know what the decision criteria is but I have never once received anything but a canned email response indicating my background was a good fit for the role to which I applied.  I have worked in Life Sciences as a consultant for over 20 years so I find that very hard to believe.  Disappointment is too weak of a word to describe the recruitment and communication process for prospective employees.  It is downright pathetic.
The online process was very efficient and easy to use.  My only feedback is to let applicants know on the resume submission screen that they will have the opportunity to provide a cover letter later in the process.
The online process is consistent with other pharmaceutical sites.  I am excited about an expedited response to my submission.  That would make your process more improved than other companies.
The online job search on J&J's website is tedious and cumbersome to use.  It is difficult to search by region and difficult to figure out where to login to see your account.  Thank you.
The online job application should be more simple and shorter.
The online interview process was very impersonal.  It would be better to perform an initial phone screening.
"The online form, while not difficult if you follow it step by step, is a little confusing. The UX (user design) could be improved."
The online experience was very good. The only feedback I would give is that you do not know whether the job is still available and/or there was any interest in the applicants skills.  Thank you very much for your time. 
"The Online conventional application being filled by the candidate - Johnson and Johnson website is customary however it will add more value if  innovative methods to hire right person for the right jobs are integrated as well . For example the application process must include a short questionnaire of about 5-10 questions able to identify the basic qualities for the Job-- example -- Sales -- Creativity, Communications, Skill, interested in topline or bottom line...etc....."
The online careers search engine was very intuitive and easy to navigate as was the online application.  I appreciated the follow-up emails to confirm that my application submission was successful.  
The online application was incredibly easy!  I appreciated receiving a notification of receipt of application.  However its been 2 weeks since I applied and I have yet to hear the status of my application.  My suggestion would be to have another notification on the status of my application.  
"The online application violated Title 9 of The Philadelphia Code, entitled ""Regulation of Businesses, Trades and Professions,"" which prohibits employers from inquiring about salary history. It is illegal in Philadelphia to “inquire about a prospective employee’s wage history, require disclosure of wage history, or condition employment or consideration for an interview or employment on disclosure of wage history.” The J&J online application provides no way to apply without disclosing wage history. Please correct this."
The online application system was inaccessible when I first tried and had to contact employees for redirection. Perhaps testing on different browsers?
The online application system is very user-friendly.  I look forward to in-person interviews.  
"The online application should have had a warning before the application was submitted. As it stands, there was no possibility of reviewing the application."
"The online application process, though efficient in casting a broad net, is very impersonal and anonymous.  The option of including a personal narrative and even an image might be helpful in the screening of candidates. "
The online application process went very smoothly compared to others I recently completed. Thank you for taking the time to improve the application process.
"The online application process was very user friendly compared to most job application processes I have seen. Judging solely from the online portal and this follow up survey, I would say the process has been very streamline up to this point. "
The online application process was very intuitive. 
"The online application process was very easy, and I did not encounter any technical issues during the process.  I think it's a great that you are getting feedback from applicants!  "
"The online application process was painless and straightforward. However, it is difficult to determine the status of my application. The request to complete this survey is the closest thing to contact I have had with JnJ hiring (besides the automated email that my application was received). I would love to have a contact, so that I could offer clarification on any questions you have about my application.

Best,
Sam Bearden"
"the online application process was easy to navigate, the post application process was quick, I received a follow up from Talent Acquisition in a matter of days and the initial interviews were soon after.  The process is ongoing, so far I have been impressed."
"The online application process was a black hole and a terrible, albeit familiar, experience. For those with no inside company or recruiter connection, a qualified candidate who applies online will probably never get through the your system. What your system did do, after applying, however is send me a job posting for a position I have absolutely no qualifications. I expected more from a large corporation and I'm sure it will take years for you to change or even acknowledge there is a problem"
The online application process is lengthily. I has applied for this position several weeks ago.   I have experience and skills and never heard from a recruiter. 
"The online application process and job description was straight-forward.
Thank you for the opportunity.
"
"The one thing is to ensure that communications are sen tback regarding the status. I have submitted several items, which I never heard back on. I get that you don't always get the job, but wouldbe nive to have an email confirming that was the end result

"The one aspect to the application process that was not clear, was how to remove an old resume from your system.  My job history has changed, therefore, my resume has been updated, and I wanted to remove my old resume from your system."
"The on line job application is a good process, however it is too rigid as far as "" YES / NO"" questions rather than giving another option such as How well do you know the following application with level of knowledge. 
"
The older version of the system allowed easier management of applications from the account I had established.  The new version is easy to use but lacks that one asset that seemed user friendly.  
"The new software removes the ability to search for jobs in a specific State or City, which leaves searches to have to sort through jobs by division or country. This takes a great deal more time than in the previous version and wastes time. Please, add back the option to search by Stage and City.

The new software doesn't include pay grade. Pay grade is important to know since no one I'm aware of is working at J&J as a hobby or because they have nothing better to do with their life. Understanding what the pay grade is for a position you are apply for lets you know if it's worth apply to. You should at least know that it's your current pay grade or higher. Without this information, you could be applying to jobs that you would never take because they don't meet your financial needs. Not offering pay grade information wastes everyone's time if someone applies and finds out the pay doesn't meet their financial needs, they have wasted their time in apply/interviewing as we as those they interview with. Please add the pay grade back into the job listings."
The new site does not list the pay grade so I am not sure if this is lower than my current grade or a lateral move.
"The new our source site doesn't seem to sync on the timing of when you get the notification that the job has posted which must come from the talent card/Workday site.  

Also, the new site is hard to narrow down- way too many options come up.  The location doesn't seem to work.  Ex. United States everything in every other country still comes up."
The new feedback/application status system is a nice imporvement. 
"The new Careers website that was just rolled out in the last week or so is very difficult to use.  Gone are the filtering, sorting, and searching options which used to exist.  

When I select for location ""Use my current selection"" it shows me ""more than 200 results"".  That's unmanageable without further filtering on location (or distance from location), posted date, job type or category.  Having a keyword-only search is useless, since the same position at different companies might have different titles or other criteria to describe the same role.  

The site is also buggy.  If I select ""Use my current selection"" for location, I get a list of values (as I mention above, a LARGE list of values).  If I then enter a keyword, I get zero results. However, if I enter the keyword first, and then the location, I get results."
"The new ""My Next Step"" application is good. I have only seen where a country can be selected. In the past, the system would allow to drill down to a state. It's a new system and I'm sure that there has been alot of effort put into it. Overall, the system works great."
The manager can be respectful of the canadidate and show up on time to the scheduled interview.
The main point to an employee acquisition process is to treat the candidate with respect and always give him a feedback even that the feedback ought not been expected. Until this moment your procedure was excellent. 
The login to the website is very complicated. 
The list about self evaluation on necessary skills overlooks the real skills and worth of a job candidate. Someone at PhD level and for a scientist position certainly can learn a new method in just a few days. 
The LinkedIn one click apply would be the ultimate process as it's very easy and pulls all necessary information quickly. 
The key is to provide feedback to all applicants.   Do not keep applicants unaware of status.
"The Johnson & Johnson recruitment process was a simplified one, no improvements needed."
The Johnson & Johnson recruitment process was a pleasant and transparent process.  
The Johnson & Johnson recruitment process is fine the way it operates.
"The job search site could be easier to navigate, but overall, I thought it was good."
"The job posting was written in ""insider language,"" in that you needed to be already working in this division of Johnson & Johnson to fully understand it. For example, the acronym GCPA was used without explaining it. Also, phrases like, ""in alignment with,"" ""organizational impact,"" ""matrixed environment,"" ""change management initiatives"" and ""drive results"" read like business-ese. Use of commas and periods is inconsistent, and the use of semicolons as well as capitalization is nonstandard, making for a choppy read. The first four paragraphs, likely from a template prepared by a communications department, are clear. To improve the recruitment process, I would write the posting as if you were trying to attract talent from outside the organization who have seen several postings from various companies and used to, and potentially turned off by, generic corporate language. In plain language, what does your division do, and what are you looking for in the candidate?

I get the impression that Johnson & Johnson is not interested in recruiting externally but instead promotes from within. If that's not the case, please work on your postings and publicize your hiring."
"The job posting was simple, clear, and straight-forward.  Submitting my application was equally painless.  However, I would have liked to see a salary posted for the position, even if listed as a range or commensurate.  Overall, this was a very pleasant application process.  I have yet to get a response to my résumé but I am excited for the opportunity and eagerly awaiting further correspondence from the hiring team."
The job posting was not the same one on INDEED
"The job posting was detailed and informative, and the job application process was straight forward. However, I have not gone to the next step so I cannot give any suggestions as to what needs improvement."
"The job posting provided a clear description of the role, including the skills and competencies needed to be successful.
This question is kind of premature since i haven't heard from the recuiter about additinal details if there are about the position"
"The job posting has good details, the careers page was easy to maneuver, and the application process was quick and easy to follow so I do not think any changes is needed."
"The job position looked very interesting and seemed to align well with my skill set, unfortunately I did not receive the opportunity for an interview. 

I would still like to work with Johnson & Johnson in the future."
The job outline was clear and concise. Johnson & Johnson did excellent work creating an appealing job posting.
"The job description was very vague and when I interviewed for the role it was profoundly different from what the hiring manager told me.  Although there is always greater detail at the hiring level, there should be more attention given to job description templates to ensure they align with the role and responsibilites of the job. "
The job description provided an insightful view into the responsibilities of this role and clearly defined what would be required of the applicant. Only thing I would suggest is a more definitive timeline of when the applicant would hear by. Thank you for your consideration!
The job application was very well organized as I recall.
The job application process was very straight-forward and easy. 
the job application process is very robotic- I would like a more personal touch
"the JnJ recruitment process is very impersonal, I am qualified and have applied to several positions, but haven't had the privilege to speak to a recruiter ever.
"
The J&J process was one of the easiest that I have gone through.
The J&J job site career portal is a bit challenging as I was getting error messages in trying to upload my CV onto the site.
"The J&J careers website is the most intuitive and well-organized careers website that I have experienced so far. One thing that I would like to suggest is making easy access to an applicant's account/profile.  It is unclear or difficult for me to find a link to get to my profile/account with J&J on the careers website.  I can access to my account via a link that was sent to me when I applied for the position, but it will be nice to have such an option at the careers website. "
"The invite to apply was user friendly and pretty much and simple, therefore no suggestions at this time. I"
"The interviewers were very well prepared and asked good questions.

J&J facility I interviewed at had difficulty finding a meeting room for us to hold the interview so we moved around to a few places - after deciding to meet in manager's office we realized it did not have air conditioning return vent and could not serve comfortably for interview.



"
The interviewer/screener was not a manager or recruiter. Her complaints of her current role and business travel were unprofessional in a recruitment interview. 
"The interview process takes a long time, I had a phone interview over (10) weeks ago. I tried to reach out to the recruiter with no response the job is still posted"
"The internal posting memo should be updated to reflect the new link verbiage (i.e. My Career & Development &gt; My next step 
It currently reads:


To view/bid on the position, internal candidates (and displaced employees within 12 months of termination) can go to:
www.oursource.biz  &gt; My Actions &gt; My Career Opportunities &gt; Access My Career Opportunities &gt; Search by Requisition #: xx"
The interface isn't user friendly. Could be redesigned and simplified.
"The initial recruiter who contacted me, Chris, was extremely polite and helpful. He truly gave me a peek in to what was in store for me when I spoke with him over the phone. However, when I met with the hiring district manager, I did not feel that way. I drove over 3 hours for that interview and he was on the phone. He had me wait over a half hour in a hotel bar with no update whatsoever with how long it was going to be. While he did apologize, he did not seem sincere. Also, when I was unable to answer one of the questions to his satisfaction, that is when I feel the interview was pretty much over. He had nothing prepared for the interview and it was a complete waste of my time. Lastly, while I knew I would not be offered the position based on how the interview went, I never heard back from anyone and find that to be unacceptable."
The initial phone interview selection process occurred relatively quickly and was easy to schedule with the recruiter. Knowing whether i have been considered for the in person interview  has taken a bit longer. After three weeks I followed up with the talent recruiter and a decision had still not been made to progress or defer.
The InApp system is quick and easy!  I cannot think of a better way.  
The implementation of a progress tracker for submitted applications would aide in providing feedback on the status of an applicant's application.
"The human touch would be a welcomed improvement. How many qualified individuals are stopped at the gate by the ATS system when there is a 70-80% match? I understand the need for best match from a product specification perspective, but on the human side? All human interactions are risky, take the plunge. "
The Human resource department need to communicate to all applicants either they are qualified or not the position the applicants applied for.
The HR/Hiring Manager take a long time to respond to Job Postings. There is an undue and unjustified requirement for Pharma Experience (even for Infra related jobs)
The HR should get in touch to applicants wether we fit or not in the role. I have applied for this several times but did not get any feedback.
"The HR recruiter needs to slow down their pitch of questioning and try to learn some of the scientific language. At times I felt my communication on specific skills might not be understood properly by HR and may reflect poorly to the actual Hiring manager given that HR person was taking notes while trying to match word to word. For example  
Question : Do you know anything about protein purification  ?
Answer: Yes I have purified multiple proteins using combination of chromatography techniques like affinity, ion exchange and gel filtration. 
Question : Do you know about ""IEX"" or ""SEC"" ?
Answer: IEX is ion exchange and SEC is gel filtration !!!!"
The hiring process took way too long. I had already accepted another position by the time J&J made me an offer
The hiring process is very long.
"The Hiring process for Johnson & Johnson  is similar to other companies, I do not think any change is required. "
"The hiring process can take a while, it is important to let candidates know where they stand. Are we moving forward with the candidacy or not? 

It is always important to let candidates know where they stand. 

Thanks you and looking forward to hearing about my candidacy. "
"The hiring manager was very last minute and disorganized, I was asked to drive 2 hours each way to the interview for 45 minutes. I should have had a phone screen first before my time was wasted. I was not given accurate information on who would be present in the room for the interview and my competitor was one of the panelists. I think in fairness this should have been disclosed by the hiring manager proactively. I did not think this was an example of doing business the right way following the Credo."
"The hardest part of the job search process is to feel like your resume ""goes into a vacuum"" and you never heard ANY feedback.  Some companies are now automating an email when status changes (resume has been received, reviewed, and a thank you message when someone else was selected).  It is a small item to add but it separates out companies that you want to work for or apply to again."
"The global application could apply and be interviewed online during the recruitment progression. Please enhance global recruitment information,making more people be a member of the company and achieve their value."
"The form is sometimes just a copy of what's on the resume; if we're always filling out this form, then there's better stuff to put on a resume. The process should be streamlined to not be repetitive or ask for specific project/material knowledge rather than just filling out the same details you'll be attaching. "
The follow up process could be a little bit faster. 
"The first communication I received from Johnson & Johnson after acknowledging receipt of my application was this email survey-- which also was the first that I understood my application was viewed, considered, and rejected."
The feed from uploading the resume to the online application needs improvement.  Some data was misplaced or missing. Needed to copy and paste some items into the application to make it accurate and complete.
The fast application process through the Linkedin interface was much better than the one from the company website.
"The fact that you've reached out to a candidate for feedback is a step above what many organizations do.  Most of the time, I don't receive an acknowledgement of my application nor any feedback.  While I understand that companies get way too many applications, getting feedback is always good.  

Personally, it makes a difference and I will continue to look at job postings for J & J.  
Best Regards"
The fact that you build up a survey is already better than a lot of company
The fact a survey was send is unique and out of the box for applying to a job. Any communication on the status of the applicant process is positive. 
The experience is correct so far. 
"The expectation of a candidate is that we would at least get an initial screening test to prove what candidate is up to for internal referrals as internal referrals are a serious recommendation considering the skill set and experience of a candidate but the candidates are not able to pass the recruiter scan in JnJ and is disappointing to get  rejected stating the candidacy is no longer will be pursued. 

We know that the the recruitment process is no easy for any organization but JnJ recruiter scan results for internal referrals has to be improved."
The entire process was very efficient and without any confusing parts.
The entire process was extremely proficient. 
The entire process could be improved if candidates were able to determine where they stand in the process as it continues.  It would be helpful to know if my application will be forwarded on to the next step or not early on in the process.
The engagement with everyone was wonderful and I appreciated having open and meaningful discussions.  The process was great.
"The employment application software froze several times during the application process.  It could be a hardware issue (laptop), but it is something that should be looked into if you have received similar reports. "
The efficiency in the recruiting process can be improved.
the current recruitment process stands good.
"The current recruitment process is greatly improved compared to several years ago. In the past, applying for a position was akin to sending one's resume into a black box. With access to an HR representative (who can answer preliminary questions, and give feedback, etc..), the process is less stressful. Thank you!!"
The current recruitment process is good.
"The current recruitment process is clear, straightforward and user friendly."
The current process worked well for me thus far. No recommendations at this time.
The current process is systematic.
The current process is satisfactory.  You have got back to me within a limited timeframe. Which is the most important for a prospective employee looking forward keenly to work with you.
"The current process is quite good, efficient and prompt. Do not see any need for major  improvement in current process."
"The current process is great, and it is much better than what was implemented a few years back. The one note I'll make though. I wish it says somewhere during the application process that one cannot go back and edit/modify the applications materials. For example, if one had intended to start the application, save it and come back and attach a cover letter s/he would not be able to. This should be clearly stated at some point, perhaps prior to submitting the final version so no applicant makes the mistake of assuming s/he can come back and submit additional documents."
"The current process Is good, need may ne to improve the sélection process"
The current process covers most of the items which a candidate is looking for. 
The current process appears effective.
"The contact between applicant and HR is lacking.  Why are we not good for the role.  Help us to be better people!  Where did our resume fail us?  I have applied for many positions and I have never heard from anyone in HR as to why I didn't fit.  Was it my resume?  Help me make it better by telling me what deterred you to calling me for an interview.  If I fail the in person interview that is my fault.  Somewhere the system is lacking personality.  Just because we are temps, does not mean we are bad people.  Come On Folks!  Lets get back to being compassionate people!  Help us!"
The computer vetting process needs work.  I met many of the required and preferred qualifications.  I resubmitted my resume and recieved no responsend the position was still posted for several days after.  The position was unposted for about a week and as of this response it is posted again in the system and I know the position is closed with an offer to a candidate.  The process needs to be corrected and updated frequently.  
"The compensation was not as competitive as the market dictates (for a senior level seller).Therefore, I had to withdraw my candidacy from consideration, as it did fulfill my salary/compensation needs. "
"The company never got back to me weather I was still being considered for the role or not.  To this day, I do not know. "
"The company could be more transparent, giving a real feedback."
"The careers website should have an option to search according to experience (i.e. Entry level, associate, manager). "
The candidate would always appreciate feedback from initial contacting recruiter (either voice message or email) after onsite interview regardless of whether a good fit is matched or not within a reasonable time frame. This survey email is the only communication I received after my onsite interview. Thank you for taking the feedback. 
"the candidate website (logging in as returning candidate) and resubmitting or submitting for new position can & has been challenging. The system will either not let you in, block your password, not let the user ID work and then online help does not seem to respond to say if error has been fixed or not. 
Other than that, so far so good!"
The candidate shall be subjected to entire recruitment process
the box shirks each time I typed. No comment at this time.
The bot that you use to weed out applications initially weeded out mine . I have the perfect experience that you requiring for the position and luckily had the where with all to put myself back in the process . 
The biggest thing is get back with applicants to let them know what is going on in the process.
The best way Johnson & Johnson can improve the recruiting process is shorten the turn around time for responses to potential candidates.
"The best outcome of course would be for there to be a fit, between the needs of the hiring manager and the candidate! 
 
Short of that, I think providing some measure of feedback on the gap would be helpful to your more qualified candidates. For example, perhaps a different level of response/follow up would be warranted if you'd like to like to steer a good apple to the apple basket, when he/she inadvertantly applied to the orange basket.

Thanks for staying focused on the candidate experience!  

Best regards,
Chris

The automated program can overlook highly qualified candidates.
"The automated emails are wonderful.  Communication through every step of the process is much appreciated.

Thank you for your consideration"
"The automated emails are helpful so at least one knows if they are still being considered or if the position is closed etc.
"
The ATS needs to be replaced with actual human interaction
"the areas where candidates can be selected (or not) will be a great plus to indicate via emails to applicants, so they understand the reasons behind emails send ny the recruiters."
"The applying process was easy and uncomplicated, but I have not heard back anything from the recruiter since I submitted my application.
Overall, I am satisfied with the application process. 
Thank you. "
"The application web site was friendly to use, I do not have any observation.
I can not give any feedback about the recruitment process at this moment."
"The application was logical and the online application website was straightforward.  It is a very efficient process already.  If anything, perhaps more personal contact, through phone calls or email, prior to the on-site interview may be helpful."
"The application was fine except for that the system did not ask me to submit a resume or cover letter.  Therefore, the HR recruiter that called me had a very old resume of mine.  I sent him my current resume and the cover letter on the spot. This event disoriented both of us because he now had to quickly review and adapt given new information on me.

Lastly, my first interaction with the HR recruiter was tough. To improve the recruitment process, I would recommend building a relationship with the candidates and avoid asking personal questions on the first interaction such as ""how much do you currently make?"" 

Asking this question at this point is extremely unprofessional.  Instead of answering this direct question, I replied with ""a minimum of $160K is an appropriate salary for the related activities in the job description."" The JNJ HR recruiter kept asking me and I shared with him that it was extremely awkward but he kept asking, ""how much do you currently make?""  I then asked him if my application was in jeopardy if I didn't share this information at this point. He refused to answer my question.

He shared with me that he was going to write that I was ""unwilling to share my current salary"" to which I replied, ""please mark down that I am unwilling to share my current salary at this time and that in the future when we have advanced then I will share my salary.""  

I have no idea what he wrote down and I have not heard back from the company on this and other roles that I have applied for.  Thank you for asking and please improve your recruitment process."
The application was easy to complete.

"the application submission site (taleo) is severely lacking. It has a poor user experience as it is not responsive, formatting issues are caused every time it pulls information from a resume, the steps and information required are redundant to what is provided in a resume. Sorting through a database of new applicants using a keyword search is outdated and will lead to lower quality candidates getting in. "
"The application submission process can be made easier and more user friendly. The forms should be precise. 
Here also while typing I cannot see what I am writing after the first two lines. This also should be rectified. "
"The application says that J&J is an equal opportunity provider but I have not seen J&J even looking into applications of international students. The moment I apply for a position, no matter how perfectly the resume overlaps with the requirements, I get a reject within a day or two. Same has happened to a lot of my colleagues who have applied for different roles in different cities, but they got a reject the very first day, because of selecting the check mark which says that they are on a visa. While others (US Citizens) at least got a chance to interview. 

This is something which does not put us in a happy scenario. Why not say it in the application process itself that being a US citizen is a prerequisite. I would love to see how this problem is addressed and what actions are taken. "
"The application process, information about the company and culture is all helpful.  I received an email when I applied about a month ago, but haven't heard anything since.  I think from a candidate experience, it is helpful to check-in with the candidate every 2-3 weeks or so if they progress beyond the minimum qualifications to a recruiter and /or hiring manager review step. This could be as simple as a system generated email, but just some way to keep the candidate informed and gauge continued interest in the role.
I also think that this survey solicitation is a good step to gather real time feedback.  Thanks for reaching out! "
"The application process was very streamlined.  The Talent Acquisition Specialist, Brittany Cooney, was very professional and helpful. It was an outstanding experience. "
The application process was very straightforward. Thanks for the opportunity and consideration for this role.
"The application process was very straightforward, however, follow up as the process progresses has been lacking.  A simple note to let candidates know what is going on and if they are still in the runnng would be very welcome."
the application process was very pleasurable.
"The application process was very intuitive and simple. I have not yet interviewed for a role. I will be able to provide more feedback at that time.
Best, Kimberly"
The application process was very easy to follow and understand.  The only recommendation I would have would be a way to check in on the status of the application during the selection process.
The application process was very easy to complete for a desired position.   Feedback on a specific opportunity is always welcome.  I am learning during my transition from the military that few corporations provide feedback or updates on the position applied for.  That would be extremely helpful.
"The application process was user friendly, and the conversation with the recruiter was informative. Overall, a good experience."
"The application process was simple. 

I have not heard back from company regarding disposition of my application, though. I suppose there would be less likelihood of candidates completing the survey if they knew they had been turned down. I figure since I'm seeing the survey first I have not been selected to progress. "
"The application process was simple and straightforward and took a minimal amount of time to complete. I appreciate that a confirmation email was sent shortly after submitting the application. I understand that you receive thousands of applications. It would be helpful to know the general timeline and whether you notify all applicants of status, particularly in the event that you decide to move forward with other candidates."
The application process was nice and simple. The system used was very intuitive and provided a very good experience! I hope to hear back from you guys soon as i would really value the opportunity to work for a reputable worldwide organization. 
"The application process was intuitive and instructions were clear.  Uploads of my resume and cover letter were easily accomplished without any problems. An automated response confirming that my application was received was promptly provided. I have no specific nor general recommendations to improve the process. Compared to the application process of other organizations, your process was either much better or equal.

Thank you

"The application process was efficient and I look forward to hearing from you!

The application process was easy and on par with other biotech/pharma company career portals. No improvement is needed. 
"The application process signup is very easy.  The workflow for the application submission (resume upload and final result) could be smoother. Once the application is submitted, the user should be taken to MyJobpage to see that the upload completed successfully. My upload failed but I didn't know it until I received the email and clicked the link to update my profile. The MyJobpage makes it easy for the user to delete/add additional documents. It would be nice to have a status on the application so you know where in the process your application is.  Thank you for listening to my feedback."
"The application process should be easy, auto fill with resume. "
"The application process itself was easy.
The recruitment process could be improved by giving updates to applicants. It is important to know whether or not you are being considered for the position you applied for."
"The application process is straightforward, time-saving. Overall I liked it very much."
"The application process is straightforward and easy to follow. I am hoping for the next step, that I will be invited for an interview."
The application process is pretty straight forward via the online application. I can provide further feedback if I continue along as a candidate. 
"The application process is lengthy and at times frustrating.  It also seems obvious that whatever answers I provide, an application will approve me to move on or disqualify me immediately given how I answer.  Not friendly, not human."
"the application process is easy to navigate, however there is no real way of tracking your status, nor are internal referrals contacted. Lastly, there should be some form of a notification that that notify a candidate that they are not  being considered for the position. Applicants are left waiting with now final outcome results. "
"The application process is clear and easy to apply. The only this I would suggest is a way to provide the User some progress. I submitted my resume, now all I can do is wait. I have no idea if I am being considered for the position or not. Did I even make it past the initial review? Would be helpful to know the timeline. Does it take 6 days or 6 weeks for the process to complete?"
"The application process has been intuitive thus far, so I don't have any current suggestions for improvement.  "
The application process does not need any major improvement however in my opinion the application invitation should be widespread. I applied through LinkedIn however there are other major job portals also where I could find no mention of the opening. 
"The application process did not allow me to submit a cover letter, which would have provided a little more insight about my experience, values and accomplishments."
The application process did have numerous typos which could deter some people from applying. I thought that I might have been on a fake website at one point.
"The application portal and job search could be improved. 
- I wish I could ""save"" positions to apply to later. 
- Improvement of the filter feature. Being able to select a specific state or city and then use the search function from there.
- I was confused the difference between ""jnjc.taleo.net"", and jobs.jnj.com. They both seemed to have different search functions and features."
The application interface was clean and intuitive. My only suggestion would be to provide an approximate application processing timeline.
"The application experience with Johnson & Johnson was, unfortunately, quite disappointing.  I received an email from Ms. Lynn Clayton, a Sourcing Specialist in the Talent Acquisition department, on April 24th.  She asked me to provide dates and times that I would be available for a 30-minute call.  I responded the same day with several date/time options. I never heard from Lynn again.  I have emailed a couple of times over the course of the past month to check in on the process, and left one voicemail, and received no response at all.  I would still be interested in discussing the opportunities to join Johnson & Johnson's team, but Ms. Clayton's lack of responsiveness after her initial outreach to me demonstrated a lack of professionalism, and lack of respect for my time.  I hope this is an anomaly, rather than J&J's standard operating process when communicating with prospective candidates."
"The aplication proces was concise. After the intervie, a futher evaluation of assertiveness can be conducted. "
The amount of time it takes for a candidate to receive feedback if their application has been reviewed and accepted or not accepted.

"The 5 sections on the job description were very helpful, however,I suggest it may make the job posting more attractive to candidates if you also include a brief section with an overview of benefits that accompany this position; i.e. medical, dental, 401(k), base salary with bonus, company car vs. car allowance. "
"The ""Talego"" (not sure of the name) has improved through the years, is not as painful as before. Is more intuitive and you can go over the application process faster."
The  process for applying was very easy and straight forward whereas many companies systems make an applicant repeat information over and over again or have to continue to copy and paste information multiple times. Thank you for making it very user friendly!
The  human  factor  would  be  nice. I  am  fustarted by the automated system  and the  coldness of the process. It would  be  a welcome  change  for  some  one  to  call  me  to  discuss  the  role. 
"That depends if I am in the recruitment process or not. I understand the need for answers that the company requires . But if I am to understand correctly , there has been no interest in my candidacy save this vague survey . Now where do we go from here ? Only then could I give an honest appraisal of your ""process""

"thanks, speed up the recruitment process. In my cases I applied for this position weeks ago, I didn't have any interview yet. Since I applied, This is the first communication (asking feedback), Even, I didn't receive a message saying when to expect to have the first meeting with a recruitment representative or at least let me know if the position is still open and I will be considered.
Thanks
"
"Thanks for the time reviewing my application. One thing I suggest to be better considered is that you as well as other companies should consider talents based on what they can do not where they come from or having Canadian experience because a good experience and strong personality can be applied everywhere. 

hopefully, you will consider minorities and people with international experience more often because some people were dedicated, caring, organized, successful, keen to do the best for the company and their teams, and they can do the same again and again where and whenever they are."
"Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback.  I would love to meet someone from the company to learn more about how HR supports the business strategy. I am very good at what I do. The location of your company and its reputation is what prompted me to apply.  If other opportunities do surface, I'd welcome the opportunity to meet with someone and learn more.  "
Thanks for the best sources...
"Thanks for asking.  I think the process would improve if there was a clear way to follow up on the status of my candidacy as well as the timeframe for filling the position.  Most importantly for an applicant such as myself I would be grateful if you could provide a rating of my application or any kind of feedback should I not be selected for the opportunity.  It may be too much to ask but I would find it helpful to know what the hiring process is.

"Thanks for asking - I feel that there are many other positions at J&J that may be a fit for me (other than the one I applied for). I am not always aware of these positions, I would like my resume to be considered for other positions if not this one. I have high regard for J&J and would like to work in the medical device/medical monitoring industry. I would even consider an entry level position. "
Thanks
"Thank you!  Just the fact that you are sending/reading this confirms my desire to work with you in the future. Hopefully, this will work out for both of us. "
Thank you!
"Thank you for your inquiry.  I have not been contacted since my initial interest on 14MAR17.  Accordingly, I do not have any direct comments at this time.

Sincerely,

"Thank you for this opportunity. I'm sure with an influx of online applications it is difficult to truly provide feedback to each applicant. However, it would be beneficial to know why certain resumes and career skills have not been selected. 

Sincerely,

"Thank you for this opportunity to provide a feedback.
I applied to Johnson & Johnson several times feeling that my qualifications absolutely fit the descriptions of the positions I was applying for. However, I was never invited to an interview. Could there be a chance that something is missing in the recruitment process? "
"Thank you for the opportunity to submit my application and resume. I did not receive a follow email or call from a recruiter. I did not go through the interview process because I did not have experience on a system but I know that if given the chance I know that I would be a great asset to the company.

"Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback.  So far, this process has been easy to follow and understand.  At this point, I do not have a suggestion for improvement.  Again, many thanks."
Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback.  I have not had any experience with the recruitment process beyond sending and application and receiving this survey.  So I'm afraid I don't have much insight to contribute.  Kind Regards.
"Thank you for the opportunity to provide  feedback. 
 Gathering data from this community will provide a basis for an improved experience

My application was submitted at least 1 month ago, and outside of the automated acknowledgment of receipt, this is the first communication I have received.  

My interest remains strong.  My skill set is undoubtedly a match to the position.  However, I have no barometer whether I am  being considered as a viable candidate.  Communication of this nature would be greatly appreciated.  Without that level of dialogue-- the applicant remains in the dark. Much thought , time and consideration is made in application submission.  An organization of your caliber can certainly implement a SOP for updating applicants of the status.

Regards,

Stephanie L. Burks

"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Johnson & Johnson application/recruitment process, which was mercifully simple.  I have two suggestions for your consideration:

Perhaps it may help to speed up and make the process simpler if once a candidate has taken the time to register on the website, details related to past employment with Johnson & Johnson, personal information such as mailing address, past income, etc. could be transferred automatically to any new application filed, with an option to edit previously submitted responses on a single screen.

Also, when asked to identify my highest level of education, there is no option to right in one that may be missing from the list. For example, I have a Masters in Public Administration in Health Services Management, but it is not among those listed and I could not write it in under ""Other"".

I hope these suggestions will be helpful in the your review of the process going forward.

Kind regards,
Aqeelah Akbar"
Thank you for taking time to collect feedback.  I have not heard from a recruiter.  I recommend calling candidates for a phone screen.
"Thank you for taking me in consideration for this survey.

All the process to applied for the postion was very informative and complete, but maybe I thought that it would take some reasonable time to evalute all candidates befores sending back an email informing that I was not a possible candidate for the position.

I'm really thinking in doing a move for professional growth, and if in a near future I see an interesting position in J&J I will apply withount any doubt.

Kind regards"
Thank you for soliciting feedback from applicants! I appreciate it.
Thank you for reviewing my application. 
Thank you for providing feedback on the application status. Many companies feel like a black hole.
"Thank you for providing an opportunity to share my experience.

I have not heard from anybody at J&J besides this survey.  I find the lack of feedback and lack of clarity to be very frustrating.  

The application process was fine, intuitive, and I'm very excited for this particular role.  

I hope to have an opportunity to share my experience and enthusiasm with the hiring team.

Thank you"
Thank you for making it simple and painless!
"Thank you for inviting me to respond to this survey. 

My recommendation would be to have swifter company feedback as to my candidacy for the position applied and/or for a conversation with Talent Acquisition. 

Best regards, Pamela"
"Thank you for giving me this opportunity to give you feedback on your recruiting process. I have a good impression of Johnson & Johnson.  From what I have been able to gather, employees of J & J feel supported by the corporation and like working there by and large.  That is important to me in looking for employment, though in this particular opening, I am more motivated by the technical challenge and opportunity. The following feedback is critical but I don't think J & J is unusual in its approach to recruiting. I think the internet has created serious problems for recruiters and I respect the fact that J & J is trying to improve its process. 

Generally speaking, my impression of Johnson & Johnson's recruitment process is that of the classic resume ""black hole"".  I don't know where I am in the process, whether I am still under consideration or whether I should try applying again in the future. As a job seeker, the problem for me is that there is very little feedback, so it is difficult to adjust my job search to focus on areas of maximum mutual interest.  Recently, I received the best rejection letter ever. It said effectively: ""we chose someone else, but we value your experience and skills and want you to keep applying to positions here"".  Now, if there were some evidence in this letter that it is not an elaborate form letter but that my resume was actually read and something of value was found there or during the interview, that would be encouraging.

Here are some ideas.  Create a database of pre-screened candidates that have expressed an interest in working at J & J.  When a hiring manager has an opening, they can look at this database and have reasonable confidence that the candidates have already been vetted.  Perhaps one could have a battery of structured interviews that assess the general skill level of the candidate on particular topics.  In addition, there could be some set of certificates a'la Coursera or Udacity that could act as specialized skill assessments.   This would be like a LinkedIn customized for J & J.  The difference would be that a set of assessments would be associated with each job description as determined by the hiring managers. The intent is that assessments are done once but are applicable to more than one opening.  By setting the application bar a bit higher, it could reduce application spam.

This is a tough problem. It might be hard to validate this approach and get it accepted across the corporation. Good luck to you.  I hope you succeed."
Thank you for give me an opportunity with a great company and high quiality.
Thank you

Job aggregation sites don't seem to be doing a good job at that, listing positions only as within a certain metropolitan area. I was quite surprised to even learn that a J&J subsidiary was nearby. "
"Talk to your existing team.

Employee feedback should be a crucial component of your recruitment process. Discuss your needs with your current staff; they may have insight into the role that a manager will miss. Plus, employee referrals are one of the best ways to attract top talent. A recent article from ERE.net makes a powerful case for employee referrals. Here are some highlights:

Referrals are the #1 source in hiring volume
Referrals are also the #1 source for new hire quality
6 percent of all hires at top performing firms are referrals
Referrals are hired at a rate of 1-out-of-3 applications for top-performing firms"
Talk to the people! Any and all communication was done by computer. You can not tell if any individual is a good fit without speaking to them. 
Talk to the candidates
"Talk to people, give them chance to meet and present, meeting in person also give good sense of the person, in old days companies used to ask hand written applications and there are people who analyze it and give summary about the person, now online systems took over, but honestly they are not that effective, same questions can be answered in many ways and all can be right, depending on the event and situations. when we work in real world/live online business world, we see lot of people have no idea what to do, reasons they are very academic, strong in doing yes/no type test, biggest test in hiring process is not of candidates but of hiring manager, how good he is reading resume. if at their level they can't figure out the person from the resume, no online system will give them anything, my apologies but it is like that. Thank you"
Talk to people that Janssen considers potential. There has to be a way to be more personal
Talk to candidates - don't rely on resume along - screening by key words is very far from conclusive. Nothing can replace a personal chat. Thank you!
Taleo is a bit outdated platform
Taleo application portal is a bit cumbersome.  LinkedIn profile should be sufficient along with a resume
Talent management group are really slow. Looks like these days it is a waste to apply via career portals as no response is being sent to the candidates. At the end the offers are extended to people with less experience and candidates are notified very late
Talent Acquisition team should do a better job towards screening applications and resume.
Talent acquisition program which J&J using was very good. I would suggest conducting job fairs along with this program for new talents will improve the recruitment process.
Talent Acquisition personnel was very pleasant to interact with.
"Talent acquisition officer was extremely helpful helping me understand the hiring process and the credo of Johnson & Johnson, which made me understand why this company can be so successful for over a century and I believe this company is the company I have been looking to work for! Everything is extremely clear and I have nothing to contribute in improving the recruitment process but gratitude. Thank you!"
Taking too long to reply 
Takes too long. Needs to move quicker. I accepted another comparable position from another large organization that started the process after I did with Janssen.
"Takes too long.
Speed it up."
Takes too long to process the application.
Takes too long to hear from the company after submiting application 
Take time to review resumes and respond back. I heard nothing although had qualifications for the position. 
Take time to contact candidate for interview.
Take time to call.
"Take the time to speak to your candidates. Forced videos, and or skill assessment tests prove very little. A candidate must be as they are at work and have the opportunity to speak live in a more realistic setting."
take the time to get to know candidates experience and skills beyond looking at position titles on a resume - you're missing out on some great talent!
"Take the job postings down from the internal site once you know you have a potential candidate.  I applied for this position because the posting was still listed in the internal site and the hiring manager had already made up her mind so I did not have a chance to interview.  

"
"Take some time to truly learn of my background, and experiences to fit the role."
take short way to select the right candidates
Take on line  evaluation test before recruitment 
take more time to find out about possible employees than what shows on paper
take more interviews
take me i want work for you guy ! :) 
Take into greater consideration the desire and initiative of the candidate
Take into consideration those that may not have sales experience but have great people skills. People buy from people they like.
take in consideration of recent graduates or expected graduates
Take a good look at my resume and give me a call (908-451-8325).
Take a different approach to select candidates. As an example spend 10 mins interviewing via Skype to understand if a person fits the position. I was rejected by an automatic message but I trully believe that I could be an asset to the company. I also trully belive if I had a chance for a one on one interview I would've been offered a position I fit for the most. 
Take a chance on those that may not have direct experience in the field. 
System seems okay. Using the browser's back button doesn't create havoc with the system so that is good. I would suggest that making sure the talent search system is compatible with all or most internet browsers.
"Survey won't help, one to one interaction in necessary."
Supply feedback as to whether candidate is a good fit for the position or should keep looking for other opportunities.
"Suggested enhancement for your on-line application interface:  Include a section ""applicants with your skills and interest also considered these other available positions"". If you've ever purchased anything on Amazon.com, they offer a similar type of prompt at the bottom that shows ""Buyers like you also considered these products"".

J&J is a big organization; it would be helpful for applicants to see other positions your are recruiting for in similar areas (example: Digital).  Applicants could then add those jobs to their Job Cart and apply with one single step making the customer/applicant experience more satisfying!
Thanks for the opportunity to provide my feedback to you.

"substantiate feedback, especially when negative"

"stop using clunky online application process. It may work for 99% of people, but if you are looking for the top 1% this is not the way"
Stop sending me surveys! Spend more time reviewing resumes and interviewing candidates.
Stop sending automated surveys when you never contact or consider me...
"Stop sending automated email responses when an applicant is denied an interview. Applicants like feedback other than an email to the effect of ""while your background is impressive, we have chosen to pursue other candidates at this time.""  Why was a candidate not chosen?  Was the resume reviewed by a person or filtered by a computer?

Thanks"
"stop looking for candidates in the same career path, there are good candidates in other industries to"
Stop it's apparent age discrimination.  
Stop hiring sociopaths or characters with sociopatic abilities. It's a shame that there no respect for diversity with documented numbers it's a shame that management doesn't have more than 4 grades in their bachelor. It's a shame you as a campany disrespect women with advanced degrees. Improve! 
"Stop having applicants apply online - every person I know who is applying for jobs complaints of the ""black hole"" called the internet where applications go ""to die"".  If you want to truly be different and show you genuinely care about your recruitment process, dare to be different, and change your process to a non-automated, more personal style of applying to jobs.

JnJ is a great company and that is why I applied, but I have to tell you that I will never again apply to JnJ - nor to any other company who allows a computer and on understaffed HR to sort through a volume of hundreds if not thousands of applications in order to determine the best applicants for a job.  This process devalues people's sense of worth, and JnJ is better than that.

Still waiting to hear if my skill set matches the position.  Any information as to where I am in the process would be helpful.  
Still waiting to hear from recruiter. 
"Still waiting to hear back on the roles I submitted for, but overall the process has been smooth."
Still waiting for the response after 20 days of my first phone interview. This wait time can be reduced or there can be a followup communication with candidate on application status. Thank you
Still I don't have much more experience so I cant give my opinion
Still early in my process but the company is very large so the actual ability to know that there is movement forward or not on an application would be greatly appreciated.
"stick with your job opening / screening and on-boarding the selected applicant. It's very frustrating for you to get people to apply, do the selection, then announce later that the job role is discontinued. Very unprofessional for a company that has the brand of J&J."
"Staying connected with the candidates - for example if you are saying that you will inform the candidates later about your decision, candidates will be waiting for your response. If you think that it will take some time before you can start responding to the candidates it would be great to communicate that to them. "

"Specify the location of the position. Also, possibly put the product that is produced by the position. "
Specify the email address or name of the individual within Human Resources to reach out to regarding to the position.  With this information the applicant can network to meet that individual.
Specify if role can be field based and status of selection has not been communicated. 
"Speaking from experience as a recruiter, J & J recruitment process is excellent."
Speak with the applicant. 
Speak with prospective canidates who may not have the required experience but make up for it with enthusiasm. 
"Speak with applicants. I don't believe I didn't fit the bill for the role, but was never contacted by HR either way."
"Sooner feedback, please, regarding where I am in the consideration process (e.g., in consideration, no longer being considered). Thank you!"
Sometimes takes too much time to receive the information related to the status of an application.
"Sometimes it is nice to be able to upload your resume and not have to then fill in all of the info. As a design professional, the look that we are trying to portray isn't there when there are a lot of forms to fill out."
Sometimes an applicant may apply for one job but a recruiter may know of a better fit position. The role of recruiters over the years seems to have moved away from doing this sort of placement. I've found companies who look at an applicants resume and think about not just the current position applied for result in a far better hiring process for both the applicant and the company. It's rare to see this sort of practice these days.
"Sometime after I initially applied I had an updated resume that I wanted to submit but I was not able to, I had to take a hard copy to the security office."
Someone qualified should screen candidates and follow-up with the qualified candidates. 
"Somehow indicate if the job has a 'preferred candidate' employees appreciate knowing ahead of time.  If preferred candidate is used, employees can look for real opportunities and avoid time-consuming preparation for a potential interview that is not going to happen.  This change would add value to the recruiting process and increase Credo value scores around job opportunity. Transparency is the key.  Preferred candidacy was the process at a previous employer and it worked well.

Second recommendation; when you reach out to the recruiter they should respond (I know they can't respond to everyone, but if they get an email they could at least acknowledge it.

Thank you for your consideration and asking for my feedback."
Some transparency of when next steps can be expected.
"Some sort of courtesy response (no thank you), before getting this survey."
Some set follow-up emails after the application submission may be valuable.
Some responsibilities for management jobs are open to interpretation. Would be helpful to include some specific examples for clarity to ensure applicants fit your needs. 
"Some postings are posted for only a few hours and others months.  Many times viewing the postings and then following the position fill, there are major gaps in what was posted as to qualifications and the skill set of those hired.  This raises many questions as to validity of Equal Opportunity, diversity amd inclusion."
"Some positions that require a Bachelors do not give the candidate the opportunity to note they are in the final process of acquiring the Degree or certification. For instance, candidates that fulfill all prereq's with the exception of the Degree/certification should have the opportunity to note that they are in the the process of completing the final semester of coursework to acquire the degree. Considering the amount of time associated with the hiring process, an applicant could vary likely obtain their degree by the time the interview process ever occurs. Also, based my experience and conversations with admin employees who hold Bachelors degrees, many admin are pigeon-holed into Admin roles simply because J&J's use of admin is severely limited to ""traditional"" admin functions that mimic those needed prior to technological progress. Unfortunately, this does not afford individuals with skills acquired from career experience prior to their employment with J&J to fully demonstrate/apply their skillset."
Some position requirements are conflicting within the same title. May lead to potential applicants ignoring positions they are actually qualified for just because they assume all postings under a given title are verbatim in terms of requirements.
Some parts of the website are difficult to navigate.  It would also be good to have a status update on your application on a periodic basis.
"Some of the selection process questionnaires could be more interactive. This would serve as a good platform to filter the right candidates to the next level, hence a short selection time."
"Some of the questions in the application are either too vagued  or it doesn't give you the opportunity to further explain why/how it was answered a certain way.  A comment box to further clarify would be very helpful.

I also think some quick points and further clarification on why the hiring team has chosen not to pursue someone as a candidate for a position would be very helpful to the person who applied. I think it's great that the email you receive encourages the same person to keep looking at other current job postings but it would be helpful to know what type of things you can improve upon for future applications. 

Thank you. "
"Some of the information gathering was redundant. I linked to my LinkedIn profile, but also needed to upload a resume. Not a big deal, just a little extra work is all."
"Some of the file upload functions were buggy using Chrome to upload resume and cover letter documents. I tried browsing local files, drop box, then Google drive. I think drive finally worked. That was the only part of the process that wasn't seamless. Thanks for the opportunity for feedback. "
"Some of the bubble answer questions fall in the gray, and there are no comment areas to explain a gray area position.  "
"Some of my colleagues and i have experienced that the external candidates like myself, who apply for the jobs posted on the company job portal hardly get considered. I have heard that these postings are usually filled by internal j&j employees. If this is true, then why are these jobs posted on public facing career site instead of internal company intranet? Just feels a bit disapointing that you apply for so many postings that seem like a good fit, but you never get contacted. Thanks for reading this and thanks for  the survey opportunity."
"Some kind of follow up notification as to whether your application is under review, still of interest to the company, or simply not interested at this time is always helpful to someone who is applying for a job - simple communication overtures go a long way.  Applying for a job is a very personal and professional experience as you're putting everything you feel is important about yourself into a package an sending it off to a stranger. Not receiving acknowledgment or feedback makes an applicant feel undervalued.  As someone who applied for a UX position at J&J and has won design awards for designing customer journey maps for HR departments I feel very strongly about this and believe a person should feel valued at every step of the process.  Hope this is helpful :)"
Some deserving candidates are rejected without being interviewed. Education and experiance should be preferred in selection process. 
"Some correspondence besides a ""thanks but no thanks"" email would be appropriate.  I value Johnson and Johnson as one of my top two choices for employment.  I have former coworkers that recommended that I apply for the position, and would value any constructive feedback as to my application.
Thanks,

"Sjoerd,

Pro: I have high regard for the products that J&J develops and I have heard many positive things about the company culture and working environment at J&J - which has interested me in apply for various roles within your company. 

Con: I have applied at J&J at least 6 times, and have never, ever received an invitation for an interview or even a phone screen. I suspect this is because I don't have 'medical device' experience. I have a wealth of education and experience in Electrical, Mechanical and Materials Engineering and I know that my skills would be an asset to J&J if given the chance. 

At the very least, wouldn't it be worth a quick phone screen for you to determine if I would be a good fit at J&J?  I look forward to hearing from you.

"Sjoerd,

I applied for the openings online but I never heard from a recruiter or from a hiring manager about my applications. And this was the 2nd time that I was asked for filling out the survey.

What is the point of this type of survey? 

Repectfully,

A very disappointed job candidate, Joanna Wang
"
"Sir or Madame,

I believe that an application status tracking tool is something that candidates enjoy while being engaged in the process.

Thank you for asking for our opinion, as well as for your time and consideration.

Single page application process consolidated view  
"Since, I am very early in the process I would not be able to provide any meaningful advice or comments. The process thus far was great and intuitive."
"Since this is the first time I was looking into the job opportunity at Johnson &  Johnson, the ease of submitting the application for the open position looks very impressive & less time taking.
However, it is also my believe that the career site should have an option to register for the career opportunity in Johnson & Johnson instead of going via the Talent community page. 
Other than that, i have no issues & it looks fantastic."
Since this is a part time position maybe include days and hours. 
"Since taking an interview for the position on 16 February, and receiving an email asking for follow-up information on 21 February, I have not heard another thing. I currently do not know the status of my application."
"Since I was a recommendation I didn't see the actual position and title until 3 months after I interviewed. During that time I was never informed the position was a lower position than my current position and somehow my current salary, role and history of my process were not communicated well to the person making me an offer.  Lead to an offer that made no sense and then an HR person questioning me why I applied as if I had been an active job seeker which I was not and made clear through the process. "
"Since I have yet to hear back after submitting my application, I would say one way to improve would be to maintain open lines of communication with the applicants. 

J&J is a leader in its respective field yet not too many positions are advertised. Perhaps, the brand can be improved by having more outside stakeholders come in to discuss and bring in fresh perspectives."
"Since I have only just recently applied, I only have the application process to comment on.  From this perspective, I have no suggestions for improvement.  It was easy and straightforward."
"Since I have not got any communication yet, will be looking forward to that as following that will be able to comment."
"Since I believe my background was perfect for the last job I applied for, and then not get an interview, that was a shock. Just saying."
Since I applied I have not been given any feedback on what my status is. Maybe giving back feedback faster to let us know what our stand with the company is. 
"Since I applied for this position a month ago, it seems a bit long to go without any follow up. Perhaps responding sooner to applications would help hold applicants' interest. Also, the acknowledgement email I received after applying should include my full application and a copy of the job description. If I apply for a position I keep the application acknowledgement in an email folder. That extra info in the acknowledgement would help me remember the details of the position I was interested in. thanks"
"Since I am very early on in the recruitment process, I can only comment on the online application process.  That process was very intuitive, fast, and easy."
"Since I am participating for the first time, I cannot provide a real good feedback. However, it's the first time that I saw a company ask for a feedback before ended up the recruitment process. 
Nevertheless, considering the current global situation on digital media aspects, every step using technology or and easy way to apply using LinkedIn or even send out a resume and cover letter shows the difference within all companies. "
"Simulation assignments during the second phase of the application process. ID is an emerging field with people from all walks of life, with that being said I think a test to assess how potential ID's approach a need or human performance gap within the organization could give better insights to the skills, knowledge, and experiences of a candidate. Strictly basing a decision from a resume and or cv does acurately give a good idea of a canidates' goodness off fit. As previously stated ID is an emerging field as much of the positions and roles are still being defined as the field expands."
Simply keep it the way it is
Simplify; remove extensive application process and account logins; don't discount qualified candidates prior to a brief phone interview at minimum.  Keep the positive J&J energy to candidates same as product clients.  Make the candidate care experience as great as the company reputation.

"Showing how the position would fit in the in long term strategy of continuous improvement.   To see terminology such as long-range plan or enterprise wide implementation, that's send a strong message of commitment.   

Asking the candidates behavior based questions that fit the company's core values could expedite the application process.  The application process should  engage the applicant quickly to assess if the position is right for both parties.   In statistical analysis this would be defined as filtering the noise in the process.  I hope you use the feedback as a gift and not as a critique. It's not intended as being critical. -LJ.

The generic e-mail response is discouraging and is driving away excellent candidates from your company.  If the volume of applicants responding to job announcements is a problem for your organization, then the current HR business model is not working optimally.  I'd then suggest that your company considers a different/revised business model in which the company stages job announcements, but surely meet its needs and equally take care of the group of applicants who applied in Ernest. This allow your company a more personalized and optimized HR search and a better response from applicants, who will also experience an opportunity to improve on their applications is feedback is given to them.  J&J should also be a leader is HR and recruitment and it should set itself apart from the genetic ""me too"" practice by all other companies.

Seeing I got a rejection notice very shortly after applying without reason even though my qualifications meet the job description I am concerned about how information is being presented at the end of the application process. I think that the yes/no answers during the questioning period of the application can be misleading without context. There is no review before submission in the application. Also there isn't free text or it isn't apparent in the application process for any notes.

I have far more qualification than what the job is looking for. It would be great to for potential candidates get a better communication with status of recruitment, or even if hiring managers have seen the resume. If, in case, a candidate isn't selected, J&J should actually consider being forefront if rejection was purly by the Electronic Application Screening system, by the recruiter him/er shelf, or hiring manager actually saw the resume.

How about make recruiters' name or email accessible in the job posting?
 
"
"Relentless interviewing of candidates who are qualified, but no offers provided paints a very bad picture for the company.  All that occurs is that a mass of people get upset for not getting hired, the company does not retain anyone of value and the reputation of the company goes down for wasting people's time."

"Regarding whether the description was clear, I can't really say. I'm not in the position. In fact, I haven't been contacted about whether I'll even get an interview. I think it was clear. I have also been applying for a lot of jobs right now and no particular job description stands out.
What can you do to improve? This is the first email I have received from your company since March 25. To improve the recruiting process, I would speed up the process or, at least, let people know in the initial contact how long they can expect to wait to hear. I understand why you might not want to give them the name of a person to contact, but having a timeframe might help."
"Regarding this position, it is very early in the process.  For others, feedback after interviews would be welcome.  I have received this in the past from your team in the past but it is not always the case.    Thank you."
"Regarding the online application process, please improve the link between creating the profile and then locating/submitting the application for the desired job.  After several unsuccessful attempts to submit the application, I located the position on the Indeed.com website, accessed the position from Indeed.com and then submitted the application."
"Regarding R&D positions, I suggest you ask about any significant publications or patents that are relevant to the position, since these may be overlooked in submitted CVs (I have 30 issued US patents, 3 of which are in high-level disinfection and the majority of the remainder pertain to medical device cleaning and disinfection).
Also, ask what the applicant reads for pleasure (I read scientific articles for pleasure).
In other words, include key questions you would ask in an interview in the on-line application process. This will facilitate the transition to an Artificial Intelligence-based process in the future."
Refrain from sending out surveys until you have actually initiated the interview process with the candidate. This survey seems premature.

Recruitment Process is okay
Recruitment Process is great at Johnson & Johnson. It could be more fast paced. But over all it's good.
Recruitment process is good but the CV of deserving and qualified candidate should be kept for future position which would be advertised and consider the CV for the same. Manytimes deserving candidate are missed out due to not applying while the opening is there.
Recruitment process is fine.
Recruitment process is fine. 
Recruitment process in general lists qualifications that you tend to meet almost 80% of the time but still there is bias in the selection process.  Would be nice to be able to understand how recruiters go about cancelling out candidates.
Recruitment process can be improved by providing requirement updates to the registered applicants by monthly or quarterly.
"Recruitment in the ""cyber age"" can maximize and streamline the process for both the candidate and the company, but there is no replacing direct connection.

One possibility would be to have a direct link with the candidate through LinkedIn - InApply - immediate connection to skill sets and experience, and if there is a match then redirect to initial/primary recruiter so that a telephone screening can be done sooner.  Nothing electronic can replace a conversation.  I often wonder if top talent is overlooked when the process becomes so impersonal.  I interview and hire in my current position.  The sooner that I can speak with someone the more I maximize my knowledge and intuition on the individual and can gage their level of interest.  I wish to not miss candidates that can contribute not just skills, but emotional intelligence, mature interpersonal skills, and bring that 'something' special to the position - I can only assess this through connection.  

In short - perhaps primary screening to establish connections with candidates that may fit now or in the future.  I think it can quickly fill a basket of truly viable candidates that feel valued from the outset whether they get the position or not. The lost art of connection is never lost on the individuals who experience it.  They will remember the company that values them in these small but important ways.

Recruiting process must move fast as candidates will be looking out actively and do not want to miss other opportunities and making decisions.
Recruiting process is broken. 
Recruiters take a long time to respond to your application. Excellent process and excellent company to work for (from retired family member and current friend). Would welcome the opportunity to become a part of its team! 
"Recruiters and talent specialists need to be able to read through a full resume presentation quickly and easily WITHOUT requiring the candidate to spend significant time loading his work experience into your templates.

For instance, my last two roles were not Finance-centric, but I offer over ten years' experience in Finance and a top-tier graduate degree. I was willing to take a step or two back to engage with J&J knowing that, over time, I'd likely find something within the global organization that was more of a complete match.

"
Recruiter was clear and provided information in a timely manner. Always responded quickly to questions.

"Recruite employees from out of state universities. When I was applying one of my friend told me that am wasting my time because I wpull never be recruited because am not attending an IVY league school and am out of state. But I decided to apply anyways because I think working for jnj will make my life meaningful. 

Besides that the application process was pretty straight forward. "
Recruit me
Recruit adults who are making a career change or maybe going back to school to get their degrees 
Recommendation for earlier feedback in the application process.
"Recommend that J&J provide job status (if position still open; when will applicant be notified (negatively or positively) by email. Also, recommend stating a closing date of position in announcement.  Thank you for the opportunity to provide input."
"Recently the internal portal was upgraded.  Although cosmetically, and user functionally improved, some useful functionality disappeared.  It was very helpful in the previous portal to search by State.  However, that functionality disappeared.  Some jobs have multiple location postings, however the title only says one.  It would be helpful to bring this functionality back."
Receiving updates about the recruitment process. Thanks!
Received this survey but have not heard about candidacy.
Really nothing that I can see at this point.  
"Really not much. Compared to applying to other companies, it was quite quick and pain free. Maybe offer status updates, but overall quite intuitive."
Realize just how dynamic and perfect I would have been for the senior HR role supporting the Supply Chain - something I did with great success at Canadian Tire.
Real consideration for well qualified candidates as opposed to the current system 
react faster with the process of identifying candidates
"Reaching out to the candidate more often, for example I don't know if I'm going to be considered for this position or not. I really love the company values and I think the employees are very satisfied to work there."
"Reaching out to prospective candidates would be greatly appreciated! At this time, I have not had any feedback at all; it would be nice to know whether or not I was being considered for this opportunity. This survey is the only thing I have received!"
Reach to applicants with an email or phone call for follow up when applications/resumes are submitted to let them know who they can contact. Whether that contact is made via phone or email would be helpful. 
"Reach out with a personal call.  I have not participated in interview process with Johnson & Johnson yet, but I have with other companies and incorporating matrix team members more into the process may help candidates understand and evaluate how work gets done more effectively."
Reach out to your candidates.  I have no idea if I'm still being considered for this role or not.
Reach out to the candidate and let them know if they're being considered for the role.
Reach Out to the applicants or start communication before sending a survey about how the application process is going on. 
Reach out to the applicant as to whether they are being considered or not for the position. 
Reach out to potential hires more 
reach out to potential candidates with ongoing communication regarding their application
"Reach out to more post-graduate students looking for employment, clearer job descriptions"
"Reach out to me. Or give instructions on to whom, or when to follow up."
"Reach out to internal candidates interested in transitioning whether role is cancelled, not selected for interview, or other situation.  

I have had my current role for 4 years next month.  I am somewhat stuck in my current role in spite of accolades including leading Best Consumer Project North America for both 2015 and 2016 and roughly 20 Encore Awards.  The site I am at is undergoing significant attrition and there are a corresponding lack of opportunities.

This opportunity was of interest in that it seemed to be an expanding group that could use my technical and quality engineering background.  Also it is in a preferable geographic location.

This type of information can help recruiters in filling requisitions while also retaining talent."
Reach out to college graduates for a training program.
Reach out to candidates to speak live to gain a better perspective of the candidate capabilities.
Reach out to candidates faster and create a channel of communication. 
Reach out to candidates especially since I am a prior JNJ employee. 
Reach out to candidates
Reach out to applicants if more jobs apply to their experience 
Reach out more to give individuals a chance. I believe that you are missing out on great opportunities to help the company succeed. 
Reach out more periodically if possible. It can feel a bit like an abyss when applying for a job. Maybe give better timing on the process as well. 
"Reach out and invite me in for an interview to discuss the position, and how I can best make changes, improvements to add value to the firm, the team, the role."
"Reach back out to the candidates when they are not selected for an interview so that they better understand where things are in the process - I think that the role is being filled (based on word of mouth), but I never received a call from HR to let me know that I would not be getting an interview."
"Rather then process jj can improve the company by adding diversity liktlebi represent. Jj misded tral grorth. Expansion and innovation by choosing the same type of candidates, an experienced engineer from the energy sector would bring so much technology that cross over opportunities would emerge again and again.  I had high hopes to bring my entrepreneurial practicecs and winnimg leadership energies that beat the markets and expected grest success. While you have a set of reasons you have really missed the wow factor on me.

All the best!

"Rather than sending automated emails, provide some feedback/update to candidates.  Staff who have interviewed to candidates in human form should not just snub emails later."
Rapid and reasonable feedback on assessment result to candidates
"Quite often, some of the questions regarding very specific skill sets are a deterrent. I have found a number of jobs which suit my skill sets except maybe for one or two specific techniques which are asked during the application process. My experience allows me to master related skills quickly and competently and perhaps sometimes my application falls through the cracks."
"Quit frankly, I question your entire recruitment process.  

In my instance, I'm a candidate who possesses 96% of the requirements you seek for the position for which I applied.  My one missing skill is experience in medical devices/regulatory practices.  However, you would find by a read of my resume that my employment background is in high-grade communications systems for satellites and that field has even more stringent requirements for fail-safe design and regulatory practices.  At the risk of appearing egotistical, learning this missing skill is trivial and requires little effort for all but the most challenged individuals.

From the automated responses received, I suspect that I never made it through the automated key word filter.  I also note that the position is still listed on the J&J employment website two weeks after my automated rejection email so you have yet to find the candidate you seek. I’m left with the conclusion that either my resume was not read by a human, not comprehended or J&J is searching for a needle in a haystack. 

Now I’m asked to spend time to fill out a questionnaire to make this process better even though I received NO meaningful feedback to increase my chances of making it through your process.   While I’m appreciative of the gall displayed by this request, I’m left with the conclusion your entire selection process doesn’t work so it’s meaningless to try to improve it.  I suggest a total revamp and wish you the best of luck.

Quit asking for feedback from your recruitment process! You only send out standard form letter responses and I have not had any real feedback as to why my nearly 20 years of pharma experience doesn't translate into getting any face to face interviews.

Quick and timely interview process. 
Qualitative reason for rejection of appilcation
Qualified candidates must at least have the opportunity for an interview.
"Put the ""human"" back in human resources.  The application and recruitment process is very unpersonable.  The confirmation email took over a day to be delivered and there has been no further communication about the role since my application (until I received a survey request).  I don't even know if the role has been filled, cancelled, or is still actively recruiting.  This creates a very poor first impression to potential candidates.  "
Put more effort in to interviewing candidates rather than basing most decisions on resume alone. 
"Pursue with candidate(s) with appropriate experience & knowledge regardless of the salary requirement.  If salary requirement is used to eliminate the qualified candidates, company will be losing the opportunity of acquiring good candidates.  It is perfectly okay to hire a candidate with more qualifications than the position requires thus company will be benefited. "
"Pursue ""retired"" Pharmaceutical Representatives that want to work part time to supplement the financial pressures of attempting to live off social security. "
"Purely from the standpoint of being a highly qualified job candidate with plenty of options, it would have been more convenient if your post on ZipRecruiter had been set up for their ""one-click apply"" link. Beyond that, the application process was very simple and easily navigated."
Providing timely feedback most important aspect of the recruiting process.
Providing the status of the process.
Providing options for interview time/date would be very beneficial during the recruitment process.
"Providing more sequential updates on where the hiring manage is in the hiring process would be beneficial:
I.e.: 
Manager is currently gathering applications.
Manager is scheduling 1st interviews
Manager is scheduling follow-up interviews
Manager has made top selection
....

This type of update would help an applicant understand when they are no longer in consideration, and could move on with other opportunities."
"Providing more descriptive feedback to candidates whether positive or negative, this will ensure that good candidates will still continue to consider J&J for future roles even if there is no fit for this immediate opportunity."
Providing feedback when you are not selected
Providing feedback or notify the next steps or that the process has ended.
providing equal opportunity to all the qualified candidate especially for the internationally-trained professionals.
"PROVIDING EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO ALL CANDIDATES.  

IN CANADA, MOSTLY INTERNAL REFERRED CANDIDATES ARE GIVEN PREFERENCE COMPARED TO CANDIDATES ABILITY, CAPABILITY, QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE . "
Providing better feedback process specially with online video interviews
Providing an improved website for faster submission. 
Providing additional information about job success factors available to the candidate at the time of application (maybe in the form of a separate document accessible to download) would give a better sense of the position and engage ideal applicants for the job. 
Providing a timeline about where my application is
"Providing a response to the job opening request in some form or fashion.  I received a note saying it was received but nothing more until this note about the process which i find quite odd that this would proceed a more formal note about the job opportunity such as its been filled, we'd like to set up a call, not the right fit, etc.  Receiving this note and request just seems out of order to me.

"Provide a real and professional feedback regarding the status of job application to the applicants. We do not know what is the status of the job application. Has it been declined? Yes, no? If yes, it is totally fine, (and legal!). However, for professional and ethical reasons, it is important to at least let the candidates/applicants know the status of the job application. Has it been closed? Just a survey email back to the applicants asking to provide feedback for a ""recent job application"" that we really do not know the status? Absolutely does not make any sense. And, for sure it is definitely not a best RH practices.

Thank for understanding.
And please Johnson & Johnson, this ""recruitment"" process is for sure not professional. Please, review your recruiting and ""talent acquisition"" process, practices, and system. Talent acquisition as well as recruitment is for sure not what this system/platform is trying to do.

Best Regards,
Anderson"

Progress/status of current position 
"Progress updates both positive and negative. I've had no updates or selection timeline provided. 
I can only hope that this survey is not an indication that the selection process has been concluded, as it would be an unusual decision for the only applicant contact to be a company serving survey."
Profiecinal replay to the targeted candidate to future opportunities with CV evaluation and the positions matching his skills in J&J from J&J side view 
"Professionally I have found some companies with great application Web sites making it easy to apply. J&J has in my mind a horrid Web application aspect which made me not even look at the company. I have met quite a few contract people from the company who have been on contract for years with no benefits and listened to I there who would not apply to the company for this reason. I applied to this job and hope this is not the only reason to have this survey as a thank you from the company. I have discussed with recruiters who send me contract jobs in the Princeton and PA area and have mentioned even with fast paced changes the companies should pay benefits while doing the job of a full time employee. People in certain fields are in demand and will not bother with these measures and will stay away from looking at companies that hire through agencies possibly due to the cost of insurance with health benefits which have gone up. J&J can improve the recruitment process by having a top reputation for treating their employees even those on contract. While recruitment from on line applicants make the process more user friendly (pay a good Web agency) and have open houses throughout the country. Provide relaunch programs for women who are entering back into the workforce after child care and parents care, etc. There are more sugestions, however, the women entering back full time  is close to my heart and very positive public relations as a re launch program or internship with no age bracket."
Professional stuff
Processing time is very long.
Process was very simple.  Don't see anything that needs to be improved.  
Process was very clear. 
Process was simple. Although I'm disappointed that I haven't received a call to move forward with your interview process. 
Process was simple 
"Process was relatively smooth. The only suggestion I have is to allow to put down more than one address since in my case I live in one state (CT). But am looking to move back to another state (NJ). Maybe you could include an option to list present address with option as to why I applied for position in NJ when I live in CT. I don't want to be ruled out because of present home address.


Thank you"
"Process was ok with me, as I am requesting a position that I am currently working with.
I would have expected an  HR representative  in the technical job interview panel.
"
Process was not difficult to maneuver through. There weren't any noticeable improvements to be made.
Process was efficient and understandable. 
"Process was clear enough, easy"
"Process needs to be open and fair to talent.  90% of the time, the candidates are nominated prior to the posting. This is not fair for the candidates applying from different sectors and Functions.  
"
Process is very robust as it is
"Process is taking too long, currently over 6 weeks passed by since my application without any feedback."
Process is lengthy but straightforward.
Process is good. I am still very interested as this was my area of study and I'm exceptional in sales.
Process is good as is
process is good
Process is good
Process is flawless.
Process is favorably.
Process is easy.  Only if you could have completed the application for me would the process be improved (slightly):)
"Probably the best suggestion would be to consider calling the candidate and having a quick phone interview. My rationale for this is the following: In today's industry there are many professionals working as consultants. As a result, the professional has different experiences and projects, not necessarily working in the same company for years and that's something that with a simple phone interview can be explained. "
"Probably provide a estimation of expected response time from the talent acquisition team on whether or not having been considered for the applied job.
Otherwise the application process was highly favorable."
Probably not feasible but faster turnaround time always helps!!!
Probably a better response time and feedback to the candidate
Proactively provide updates to candidates letting them know if they if they are still being considered for the positions they applied for. 
Proactively check on applicants.
Proactively check in with the previous applicants and while doing so set your candidates expectations with job success factors.  
"Prioritize response time and be specific about timelines for candidates to know the status of their application. I don't think you have a careers blog? you should explore this - best practice is Accenture's.I know you have tons of rejection mails to send, but make an effort not to be generic and be specific in feedback as to why the candidate will not be progression very well - state governments do a good job with this."
"Pretty smooth process,no specific improvement recommended at this time. "
"Pretty nice process, in that JNJ let applicants know the status quickly."
Pretty flawless.
pretty easy and straight forward to apply.
Precise and clear requirements are very important to the candidate; this will benefit both company and potential applicants. 
practically zero feedback on status of my application .    have i been rejected?  overall very poor experience.    this actually is the first i can recall any interaction with jnj
Potentially have someone you can reach out via email to regarding open positions if you have some baseline questions as you try to determine if it is the right position. For example there were several positions posted in CGI but there was no contact information to contact someone so that I could ensure that I was applying to the best fit position.
potentially assign a recruiter as a point of contact. 
"Postings should be more visible, perhaps make it easier to access and see the available positions."
"Posting was for Livermore Ca, but then said Los Angeles at the end of the application process."
"Posting search is very bad, filter is only by contry.  estate should be added inorder to look for position in a state or region(not only a country)"
Posting process was smooth.
Posting jobs with veterans placement organizations would provide access to well trained persons looking for employment.
"Post openings on all career sites, ensuring that the company standout (advertisement). "
Post more job openings on LinkedIn
Post a short video describing the steps (process) of hiring
"Possibly, promoting some more pharmacists as Medication Safety Experts since the greatest part of your company's medication product information, pharmacodynamics, & possible interaction questions are typically ask by patients to us. As all studies have shown, a patient that is compliant and adherent on their medication regimen has a greater chance of having a primary or a secondary condition based hospitalization.  "
Possibly shorten the amount of time it takes to apply.  It is tedious and takes a lot of time.
Possibly reaching out to potential candidates directly via a phone call would be a nice incentive
Possibly provide contact information to follow up once applied.
"Possibly notify applicants of application status oncenteno successfully received.   Meaning in progress, viewed by recruiter, etc.  Otherwise very seamless and efficient process."
Possibly network with a range of professional organizations that focus on clinical research that include individuals who have a reputation of building strong working relationships with clinical sites and their research staff. The job description that I reviewed and applied for fits a number of my professional goals and objectives. 
Possibly more questions on successes outside of work to balance work/life to decrease burn out.
"Possibly more community activity, being more present to show that there are opportunities with such a large company. "
Possibly mentioning the number of employees they are looking to hire for the specific position. 
Possibly make it more human.
Possibly include option to upload a video interview. 
Possibly have a video interview to help analyze personality. 
Possibly have a Johnson & Johnson exclusive job fair.  Possibly present all open positions at one of your venues. 
"Possibly follow up with those who have applied online, either with a yay or nay for next steps

It's been about 3 weeks I believe and haven't yet seen anything from your staff

Thank you for providing the interesting survey"
Possibly communicate a little more. I'm still unsure wether or not I am still being considered.
Possibly begin the initial phone interviews within 2 weeks of job posting.
Possibly add a statement that Johnson and Johnson will provide a follow up response in x number of weeks.
Possibly a response when submitting a application with a time line for the process.
Possible recommend other roles and positions that may be a good or better fit for the candidate 
Possibility to include reference after to submit to the process.
Position's usually does not tell if you are willing to except candidates on work  visa or not. That visa information if made clear would be helpful.
"Position of Director, Patient Insights

As of yet I am still waiting to hear back from a person one way or the other. I have received the automated ""we received you application"" mail, and nothing since.

I strongly believe it to be good and professional behavior to let applicants know of the progress. If a decision has not been made, an interim email letting me know would be nice. If I am not in the running (anymore), it would be nice to hear about that. If there are questions about my resume, qualifications or experience, I am more than happy to answer them. That is why you received an application in the first place.

I know the posting has been removed, so obviously enough ""good"" applications have been received. I also realize recruiters are probably dealing with dozens if not hundred of submission a day, but seeing your application disappear in a black hole is not becoming any company, let a lone a world-class one like J&J.

Food for thought. Happy and open to discuss this, or my application, further at your convenience.

Por el momento el proceso está claro y completo. Tal vez dar un status seguido del proceso del reclutamiento. 
Poor communication/feedback.  Too slow to proceed or conclude.  Have gotten no further communication on either of the positions to which I applied in over 3 weeks.
"Please, hire me or at least can I get an interview. That's my request to the company that I know since my childhood. "
"Please, call more candidates like me, for a face to face interview. Give me the opportunity."
Please update candidates on application status.
Please try to provide a response back to the candidate on wihether they are a prospect or not for the role they apply for. If you do this already then I apologize however I have not had this occur on roles I have applied for.
"Please the lines of communication more transparent and open.  Expectations about hearing back were set, and not adhered to.  Very difficult to juggle a competing offer when this was the job I want the most.  I've followed up with the hiring manager and the talent acquisition lead, and heard nothing in return. Both parties have invested highly in this process, but the unprofessionall conduct on the Janssen end has been extremely disappointing."
Please tell your intern decision asap
Please take a long look at my pharmaceutical and specialty experience.  I would love to be contacted for an interview.  I am very interested in this position and can move to Atlanta as soon as possible. Thank you!

Please review my credentials in more detail as I have the experience and the commitment to be a great employee to the J and J team and I feel I have not been given the chance.

Don't discriminate because of there race or age be truthful/blind and hire what is best for J&J and the person who has spent time applying to a great company.
"Please give more feedback on the status of the application. I have had several applications that sit for months with zero feedback. I want to know if I am still being considered for the position, and if so where in the hiring process the position is. If I am not in the running, I would like to know as well so that I can continue to move forward finding positions instead of sitting and waiting for one that I am not even being considered for."
Please give me an opportunity!  
Please give me an opportunity to be interviewed. Also offer job sharing or having 2 people cover a territory. This will allow some people to reenter the market after an absence ie. maternity leave or find unique individuals that will boos at territories sales by having a differing skill set to drive the sales.
Please give me an interview opportunity

Please follow up with phone calls. I'm frequently inundated with persons purporting to be J&J recruiters and all they want to discuss is ridiculously low salaries that are nothing like the remuneration J&J is known for. These contacts are not in response to my inquiry.
"Please explore the possibility of interviewing a candidate that may no have 100% of the required skill-sets, otherwise you completely eliminate the possibility of finding a true talent. Sometimes it can be perceived that if one selects ""No"" to any of the job spec questions,  your Resume will automatically not be reviewed. "
please explain why my application was rejected

Please do provide a feedback if a candidate is not selected. I did not hear anything back.
Please do not send out these surveys 24 hours after the applicant applies. Applicant waiting for info from the company not for a survey.  Better to to do one survey once candidacy has concluded -- either in an offer or a rejection.

"Please consider international students, there are lot of talent, I believe for the given job description at least I should get an interview call, but due to being an international student I did not get it"
Please communicate on the status and feedback in a timely manner
Please call me for an interview. :O)
Please Call me 267-230-6637 and I will tell you in details.
"Please bear in mind that I am giving this feedback in context of the fact that I was not shortlisted for the interview. I have two points to make:

1. I guess for senior roles, where it is possibly not hard to guess that the candidate (in this case, me), might perceive herself/himself a ""close fit"", it is helpful to give some feedback to deal with the candidate's expectations.  Better still, a chance to discuss/interview the candidate, would be great. I can imagine that you must receive hundreds of applications, but equally, 90-95% of them must not be an obvious fit, where the candidate in the heart of heart also knows the same, and thus you don't have to do this with everyone.

2. I am an experienced individual, and was applying for a role that was possibly a shade behind my seniority, but nonetheless one that I would have truly enjoyed doing whilst also learning what it means to work in JnJ; in other words, had I been selected it would have been a job I would have done very well, whilst preparing to take on more senior responsibilities later on. Since I was not selected or even shortlisted, I got the sense, reinforced also by an email I got, that my seniority might have been a negative factor. It said that we don't know if we can keep you motivated. I found that a bit hard to digest in today's context, where diversity is such a big word. I am sure JnJ does not have such a policy."
Please always send feedback to applicants.
Please allow candidate to enter name of J&J-referral person during application process. 
"Please add back paygrades to the roles posted. Under the new process, this information is no longer visible and roles desciption at time could be not clear enough for which level the company is recriuting. otherwise, the new process is much faster, so no complaints!"
place more emphasis on individual qualifications than computer based prescreening selection tools. I personally have many years of experience in level 1 trauma hospital dealing with physicians and clients. I also have many years experience of managing a company outside of healthcare. I have the education as well however the sample questions in your prescreening computerized program do not accurately reflect my qualifications and I may be overlooked. There may be many potentially qualified candidates that will not be even contacted by a recruiter due to this process. I strongly urge to look at have recruiters look at actual resumes and reach out to perspective candidates. 
Phone surveys is always an option to ask questions to see if the potential candidate is a perfect fit. 
Phone screening to find out credential of candidates 
Phone call would be best!
Phone call interviews
Phone call from the recruiter to discuss the role and qualifications
personnal contact to clarify some points. Thanks
"Personally, I have found that even for roles that I appear to be very well-qualified for, I don't even receive an initial screening call.  While I know that you receive many applications for each position, I am still surprised that I have only rarely made it through the initial application process.  "
"Personally, 

I believe the recruitment process should be more personable for potential candidates. However, I understand that's might be difficult depending on the amount of weekly applications. 

I can't say anything more than that, unless I was fully informed about the overall process of how J&J recruits candidates. "
Personally reach out to candidates
Personally and formally reach out to prospective candidates. 
Personalize the process by familiarizing yourself with the applicant 
Personalize it more. These days everything is electronic and it's a lot of waiting around 
"Personality fit questionnaire, I believe today's workforce is about team collaborations and having ""team"" chemistry. I believe getting an insight on a candidate's personality might provide more information on their success to the company."
"Personal touch.  I know that you may receive thousands of applications on a weekly basis, however, I have in the past like the experiences where I would get a phone call with some type of feedback allowing for five to ten minutes of conversation.  I enjoy hearing the ""Thank you for your interest in our company.""

"Personal interviews. Primary selection is done based on a resume without knowing the person, the way the person think, etc."
"Personal interviews

Personal interaction with candidates.
Personal follow up on each application submitted via phone call to personalize the experience and offer feedback as to why a person was denied or accepted as a potential team member. 
Personal contact.
"Personal contact with applicants would be appreciated, but understandably be difficult given the size of the company and its pool of applicants.

Regular updates on the progression of the recruitment process would provide assurance that the applicant is at least still being considered."
Personal Contact
"Person-to-person feedback on selection process.
Provide information on whether the person doesn't have the qualifications required or is it that the interview process was not satisfactory."
Permit change of location among staff to make the job more fun.
Periodic updates or changes in status as the process moves along.  
Periodic update on the role; weekly or biweekly.
"Periodic update of the hiring status. I understand it would be time consuming for your staff to update all the applicants. An automatic message can be sent out to the applicants so they know at least, if interview has started, if the role is filled, etc. Job applications very often felt like a black hole. Feedback would be appreciated. "
periodic status updates
"Periodic notifications to candidates on application status, or update status online so that it is accurate and current, would be appreciated.  "
"Perhaps, provide promptly feedback to the candidate if he/she meets the criteria to move to the next level"
"Perhaps, open the floor for communication for perspective employees. "
"Perhaps, highlight who the position reports to on the job description? And, perhaps, highlight or emphasize any or possible growth and development. "
Perhaps state the application closing period so people whobapply can expect when to hear back.
Perhaps speed up the response process
Perhaps showing why the participant did not proceed in the recruitment process.
"Perhaps show the status of your application on a given day so you can determine if you are being considered, etc"
Perhaps send updates/responses at regular time intervals on the progress of one's application
Perhaps send the survey after an interview or after additional interaction with Johnson & Johnson.  This will allow a candidate to provide feedback and perspective on a wider range of the recruitment process as opposed to just the application process.
"Perhaps revert back to me with more feedback on why I did not get selected for an interview and what you thought was missing in my application. 
Even if I was not selected for an interview, I do appreciate some feedback. "
Perhaps responding a little quicker?  I applied for this position over a month ago and only recently got the email saying I was not being considered.  A follow up email after applying to confirm you received my application would be great also.
"Perhaps reply quicker to a candidate's application and set an interview with them,in person, to see if they are the right fit for the J&J."
"Perhaps reduce the time between the ""video interview"" and notification that I would come in for a interview."
Perhaps providing information if the role has been filled. Thank you.
"Perhaps provide more timely feedback on candidate status.  Other than that, process is quite good."
"Perhaps provide more detailed information to he applicants such as:
1) How many people have applied to the same position?
2) Use AI to determine if your experience and education is a match or not and give that feedback to the applicants.  For example - ""Your experience is a 90% match to he position.""
3) More detailed feedback as far as when the target hire date might be."
Perhaps provide a name and address to designate cover letters to. 
Perhaps provide a chance for experienced candidates for an interview! 
"Perhaps open house events for potential Senior Management candidates to speak to current associates?  I understand the ""open house"" concept would likely require some degree of candidate vetting and invitations."
Perhaps one simple thing is to revisit previous high quality candidates and try to reach out to them. They may be the stars the firm is looking for afterall.
"Perhaps not be so quick to rule out candidates.. I was rejected before even having a chance to speak to anyone.

Thanks!"
"Perhaps more timely follow up notifications to candidates who have applied for positions. Responses are always good, because it reflects how important communication is in the eyes of the company. "
Perhaps more follow up with The candidate regarding where they are in the hiring process
Perhaps more feedback.. I applied just over a month ago and have had no feedback other than the verification email that the application was finished.  Perhaps a once monthly email to applicants letting them know if they are in the remaining prospects or not.  Waiting for months for a rejection letter isn't productive and doesn't give good candidates a feel for where they stand.  Thanks.
Perhaps more direct interaction with recruiters and have the recruiters reach out by phone to candidates.
Perhaps make it simpler by using the LinkedIn resume import and not force applicant to fill out experience and education manually.
Perhaps let a candidate know if the position has been filled when it does.
Perhaps J&J can inform the candidate of where their application is throughout the process.
Perhaps giving more feed back to candidates 
"Perhaps get back to folks in shorter time-frames on next steps.  Also, let folks know when they should hear back on whether they are going to be considered for a job.  i.e., the job posting closes on April 7th, you should hear back by April 17th.  Good Luck.. "
Perhaps follow up with potential applicants via phone to discuss alternate opportunities if the position applied for becomes unavailable or if a more appropriate fit can be found.
Perhaps follow up on status of postings candidates apply for so they know where they stand in the process. I applied several weeks ago and not sure if the position is still available. Thanks!
"Perhaps feedback on how to improve as potential candidate for future, if applicant requests."
Perhaps faster response as well as an improved paradigm of the potential value of candidates from other sectors with transferable skills. 
Perhaps consider real-time status updates.
"Perhaps consider asking for a bit less time involvement from perspective applicants.  Many companies require 10-20 min to fill out all their forms, only to get an automated response in return.  Perhaps model after head hunters that only require an email with resume?  Otherwise very well done, and a good model for other companies...but that is just status-quo for J&J."
"Perhaps conduct a phone interview with the candidates that have potential and clarify the positions specific requirements and let the candidate provide verbal input regarding their work skills, content expertise (s) and worklife balance and ability to work on a cohesive team. Karen Cossaboon, MHS,CHES,PMI"
"Perhaps communicate the next step more quickly, if possible. In my case, I applied on April 23, so it's been more than 3 weeks and I don't know if I'm still in consideration or not. I hope I'm still in the mix as I would love to learn more about the position and J & J. 

"
Perhaps come to campus for information sessions more frequently.
"Perhaps change the responsive design of the site so that the questions are able to be seen on screen, rather than having to scroll down to see it. Beyond that minor design aspect, the process was smooth and intuitive."
Perhaps better communication like a follow up phone call or email.
"Perhaps better and more frequent communication about positions that have been applied for.  For example, I applied a number of weeks ago and have not received any notification until this survey was sent today.  I have no knowledge if the position I have applied for has been filled, no longer available, or if I'm a potential candidate."
Perhaps be a bit quicker in selection and communication. 
Perhaps an estimate as to when I may get a response regarding the specific job application.
Perhaps a Talent Acquisition Specialist could contact me by phone? 
Perhaps a quicker response to applicants whether it be good news or even bad news.
Perhaps a personal phone call to let the applicants the status of their applications.
Perhaps a personal follow for feedback.
Perhaps a live phone call versus an emailed questionnaire.  More timely follow up to understand status; especially after being told you are 'being strongly considered'.  
Perhaps a list of must haves in the requirements section.  And a list of nice to have but not mandatory.
Perfect for now.
"People like me who have domain specific skills will be focusing on Pharma/Biotech companies. If there is an app for career that would really help us to keep track of Job posting at J&J.

There is a big time lag between applying and getting a response. If that can be shorten that will help, sometime we dont even remember the job description when HR calls us."
People are anxious for new positions and want the process to complete quicker.
Pay me more!

Participate at more local job fairs
"Part of the recruiting process should include replying to an applicant who has completed and summited an application/resume. Updates, including when application was received, what to expect next, estimated time of the recruitment process and notification if the position is no longer available or the applicant is no longer being considered would improve your process. Thank you for this opportunity to participate in your survey."
P&G does a great job with screening potential employees by making sure there purpose values and principles fit with the company's by a series of question in the application process. 
"Overall, the recruitment process has been satisfactory. I appreciated receiving automated emails to confirm receipt of my application. The job description was clear and well described.

The only improvement I suggest would be to inform applicants of your timeline for short listing and selecting for the opportunity so the next steps are well understood.

Otherwise, great job! I look forward to hearing from you further about this opportunity.

"Overall, the process is fairly easy and straight forward. It is nice that some information is copied over when applying to multiple positions within the company. Communication through email also works well. "
"Overall, the Johnson & Johnson talent acquisition process is intuitive in its functionality and easily accessible across platforms. 

One recommendation I would make is to implement an automated ""status"" message (i.e., every 2 - 3 weeks). Specifically, for those positions currently being recruited, but maintaining a substantially longer lead time in terms of next steps / selections. 

This added layer of engagement, keeping candidates apprised of the positions they have expressed interest in, is a nice way to further the values and professionalism Johnson & Johnson is committed to and embodies. 

Thank you.

"
"Overall, I thought it was a positive hiring process. Maybe have a section that explicitly asks if the candidate meets specific minimum requirements (i.e. do you have 2 years of CAD experience?). I like this because then I know if I'm a good fit or not. "
"Overall, I have been impressed with the process to date. I am especially impressed that Johnson & Johnson takes care to follow up with candidates on how they might improve the recruitment process. 

While I received notification that I was not being considered for one position that I applied for, I did not receive notification for the second position that I applied for. I would like to understand where I stand in the application process for this position. In terms of improving the recruitment process, I would consider this to be overall communication regarding where individuals stand in the process. 

Thank you. "
"Overall, I felt the process was very smooth.  

I appreciated receiving updates regarding the application process and timeline, regardless of my success.

Comparatively other companies typically are ~4 weeks in my experience. Overall thought the process went very well. "

Outstanding process. Thank you
"Outside of hiring me, not much more except maybe provide the job description to the applicant as a resource. I found after I applied, it took several weeks prior to a phone interview and subsequent face to face. By the time of the phone screen the job posting was removed and I was unable to review the fine details for possible questions. I'll be honest and felt I could've been better prepared. "
"Outside of getting this survey to (optionally) complete, I would have liked to have received some other type of feedback/input with respect to the application process .  It has been some time now and I am unsure as to whether the position is still open or not.  I am still very interested and am instilling hope that either way in the very near future that I hear something to that end, soon."
"Out of the many hundreds of opportunities I have applied for I have never even gotten a phone call interview out of this process. I have 15 years medical experience and many exactly along the lines of the positions that are open.
Now I just apply without any expectations."
"Out of the box approach, if you look for a fresh view... you have to look outside :)"
Out a system in place on the application area to weed out applicants that do not meet the criteria for the job. 
"Other than this survey I have not yet been contacted for either a phone or a face-to-face interview.  So, at this time, I can't offer any suggestions to improve the process.  I hope there is interest, as I would very much like to be a part J &J.

Thank You"
Other than this survey I have not heard anything from J&J. Would be nice to have some sort of update. 
"Other than this requested survey, I have had no interaction on this position at all.  I am a very qualified candidate and was quite excited about the role - but haven't heard from anyone at J&J which is disappointing."
"Other than the online application process, I haven't gone through the full life cycle of recruitment, so it is difficult to offer additional feedback. If not already occurring, I would encourage recruiters to socialize resumes not selected to move forward with other internal recruiters for other roles that are a potential fit. "
"Other than providing me a status update regarding my application, I can't think of any improvements to your recruitment process. "
"Other than possibly having a timeline of when the position is planned to be filled, nothing"
Other than calling me for an interview???  
Other than an acknowledgment of the application I have had no contact with anyone from J and J.
Other than acknowledging the receipt of my application I did not receive any additional correspondence from J&J.
Other companies send an automatically generated email to candidates when a position is closed.  Good opportunity for J&J to implement.
Option to confirm if the resume or application was seen; option to verify if the position was closed.
"Opportunity for a phone discussion with a hiring manager or knowledgeable HR rep. Overall, the application was straightforward."
Opportunities!!!
Opportiniti more visible.
Oportunidad de evaluar al candidato en sus conocimientos sobre las funciones a realizarse en el lugar asignado. Buen dominio ala momento de ejecutar las tareas asignadas en la industria .
Open up some alternatives or options for recruitment and be part of the company.
Open interviews can bring more qualifiers into the job and also easy to sort 
"Only thing I would say, as with most companies, is I'd like to get a quicker response if the company wants to move forward with my application or not."
"Only the time process to hear back and start the interview process, also the start date.  Looking forward to starting a career with JnJ. "
"Only send surveys if the candidate is selected for an interview.  We apply for many positions and it can be a lengthy time before finding out the status.  Yet, there are so many surveys sent."
Only problem was that I forgot my password and it took about 10 minutes to receive it.  A long time when you're trying to submit an application.
Only post jobs that are truly open and available to the general public.
"Only improvement I suggest is ""Create an FAQ page on your careers site"", it helps to cut down on the number of applicant questions you may receive during the hiring process – and that helps you save time and process employment applications more quickly.
For Ex: 
Do you have both part-time and full-time positions available?
How often should I update it?
How long will it take before I can expect a call to schedule an interview?
How many stages are typically involved in your interviewing process?
Will I receive a confirmation once I submit my application?

Also, add a link to the applicant tracking system, where it says the Status of applicant."
"Only I would like to hear the processing or any feedback earlier by email after we applied for the position. 

"
Only comment is that there is no follow up positive or negative whicc states status of being still under evaluaton or not to.
Only at first stage so to early to form an opinion.
Online reviews state the application to onboarding process may take up to several months.  Maybe finding creative solutions to minimize that time if those reviews are indeed true. 
Online process is good. Awaiting feedback at present. Would be good to have a timescale of when I would expect to hear. 
"Online application process works well. Not having progressed beyond that stage, it's too soon to comment on subsequent steps."
One way to improve would be a quick response time. Also to consider conducting a phone screening to filter qualified candidates from the rest.
"One way I believe that the recruitment process can be improved is by engaging the candidate.  This can be done by communicating with the candidate with an update on the status of their application.  Giving the candidate a clear timeline on the decision making process is another good way to engage the candidate.  I've applied to a few positions with JNJ and I never hear back from anyone. Additionally, consider providing feedback to candidates on why they were not selected. Approach the conversation in a way that keeps the door open for on on-going relationship

Another way to improve the recruitment process is to enable the candidate to update their resume.  Sometimes we feel like we have drafted the perfect resume or cover letter and we submit it.  After submitting it we look it over and realize a flaw or mistake."
One tool I have seen in the past that was very nice to the applicant was an email stating the application was received and the applicant would not be interviewed further for the current role.  Upon receiving that email an applicant would feel compelled to re-visit your careers page and search for other positions that might be a better fit.
One to one responses to applicants would be appreciated. 
One to one contact with recruiter 
"One thing I sure hope to know, as a candidate that the company will let me know my application status regardless of your decision.  Thank you.  "
"One suggestion to improve the recruitment process could be to allow more person to person interview opportunities. This would be beneficial to those who have specific skillsets or multiple skills that would benefit Johnson & Johnson in a positive way. People who have a strong work ethic and the ability to learn quickly would be preferred.

Another strategy could involve giving out a standardized IQ test in addition to the application process, based on the materials or information needed to succeed in the workplace. This could vary based on those job requirements."
"One or two weeks after the application is submitted,  some status notification to the applicant would be nice."
One of the things Johnson & Johnson can do to improve the recruitment process is have more open house recruiting for health care professionals.
One of the better online application websites I've experienced.
One of the best recruitment process I have applied for.
"One improvement that I would recommend to the Acquisition team is to also interview the candidate(s) who were selected to take this survey that compiles data on the application process for the company by extending the process of an one-on-one pre-interview to get to know more about that candidate(s) goals, motivation and drive to do the job in which they are applying so you can get a feel if that person fits the personalities and team environment to be successful within that department rather than solely reviewing the resume.

I'm being totally bias as I have been interested in utilizing my sales skill sets in making a difference within the medical sales industry and looking to contribute to the revenue growth of an well known and respected company such as Johnson & Johnson. I would welcome the opportunity to prove it. Thanks for the consideration.

Best,

Debra Rhone "
One improvement may be response time to applications.
One gets the feeling that HR and a computer completely control who is considered for a position and not the hiring managers. It is cold and uninviting.
One factor to improve the recruitment process would be more timely feedback.
One area of opportunity is response timing.  I find that the response time for reverting evaluation of qualifications for a role (primarily if Company is uninterested in extending an opportunity for screening/interview) tends to be longer than other companies.
"Once, I was informed that J&J is not willing to hire with OPT-STEM work visa.
You can be a little more diverse ;), 
I believe that diversity could and did bring disruptive research/business, not from family and friends business who does not confront the idea of the peers.
Best and Thanks.

Once you interview a candidate you should let them know right away if you are going to offer them a position instead of making them wait 2 weeks.  
Once you apply for a role there's no feedback on why or why not you were selected to interview.   In essence no one closes the loop on your bid.
"Once the application is complete, it would be very helpful to receive an email with an estimated timeline on when the outcome of the application for the first screening will be communicated."
"Once the application has been submitted, provide periodic updates to explain what is happening even if it is as simple as saying J&J is still collecting resumes for the role.  I have not heard anything regarding my submission other than the receipt email."
"Once I responded to what my current salary/income was I never contacted again.  That seemed odd.  It's not what I was requiring and I feel like I was wrongly eliminated from the process at that point.  Shortsighted and over assuming.  If this was the case, I would recommend your talent acquisition team look at more appropriate criteria."
"Once I applied, I did not hear any feedback as to my application.  I am not sure if the position is still open or has been filled.

It is professional to let the candidate know if he/she is being considered.  Thank you.

Mark"
"Once I applied for the role, I had no response whatsoever that my application had been received, reviewed and or rejected.
I think if there was some communication after the application goes through - this would be great for the candidates."
"Once candidates apply to a job listings they should be informed of the outcome of their applications. If the job has been filled then send an email stating so. Applying at JnJ is like a black box...you can apply all you want the best you will get it an auto response stating your application has been received but nothing after, ever."
"Once application is submitted, there is a long lead time to hear on next decision.  "
"Once an offer is made the electronic forms of documentation are very difficult. I had Taleo login issues and the Yale system isn't very helpful in explaining that you have to go back to the first section to ""submit"" the check."
"Once an application is submitted, there is no way to amend the document, perhaps the database need to be adjusted that return applicant can modify their document or statement after submission. For some reason my resume was not attached during my application to a job. This was pointed out to me by a recuriter and when i went back to add my resume for that job posting it wouldn't let me do it with the account I had. So I had to create another account with a different email to provide the info."
"Once an application is submitted, send updates every 2 weeks, even if they're automated. Am I still in the running? Have you selected another candidate? Receiving a rejection letter months after applying is unsettling and makes J & J seem like they don't regard their candidates highly.

"On March 9th, I applied for the IT Lead, Product Supply PLO OneMD position. A month had gone by and I haven't heard back. In places such as Albuquerque, NM in which the talent pool is not very deep, I would recommend getting back to prospective candidates in a timely manner. I would have loved to be considered for the position, and I think that I have the experience, skills and qualifications to perform it well. Unfortunately, I got no response. "
"On line submission for job postings, is a very difficult process, I should be considered a top applicant for this position, and I was not contacted."
"Often times you apply for a role and never hear anything i.e. feedback on skills or qualification therefore you never know why you may not have gotten the role. It would be great, if feedback was provided and/or even a response to whether someone else was chosen."

It would help to be able to know if an internal candidate has been identified or if there were a particular hindrance.

Those selected by the computer should be evaluated by the human recruiter and chosen for the first phone call.  The phone call should reiterate the job description along with what they are seeking.  During the phone call, the HR Recruiter can focus in on the potential employee's personality and behaviors.

"Number 1 suggestion, without a doubt: provide a status update field to provide candidates with information on the status of their submitted application(s).

Notifying people even if they don't get an interview and thanking them for applying. 
Notifying if the person Resume has met the credentials of the job.  
Notifying candidates when and why they are not considered for a position.  Most of the times this notification is not received and the candidate has to assume he/she was not considered due to the lack of communication from J&J recruiters.
Notifying applicants when they are not selected for an interview. 
Notifying about the hiring process progress via email. 
Notify your applicants even if they did not get an interview. I applied and haven't heard back from anyone until I received these 2 emails for a survey on a department I've never even dealt with.
Notify the applicants (automated) if they are still being considered for the position before surveying them 
Notify the applicant when they don't meet the requirements. 
Notify status to applicants within a reasonable time.
Notify request status

"Notify of status of the position; Application seen & reviewed, application pending (not reviewed), or reviewed and not selected"

Notify applicants of their status within a reasonable amount of time (2 weeks or less).
Notify applicants either way. I get so excited every time I fill out an application for you guys thinking this time could be my big break. I'd like to know either way so I can not worry about it as much. I'll take any position to get In the door please. My current work environment is a scary situation because Lowes keeps laying people off and my friend Ted works for your company and says it would be a great opportunity. I don't mean to wastes your time on your survey I just really could use the opportunity I won't let you down. Thanks for your time. 
Notify applicants as to when they will hear back either yes or no. I felt the process left me guessing at the end. 
Notify applicant on the status of their application on a weekly basis or provide an estimated timeframe on when the applicant would be notified i.e. your application is still being processed or under review... 
"Notify a candidate, even if the Candidate is removed from consideration.  I have not heard anything regarding the status of my application since submitting.   Thank you for the opportunity to provide some feedback.  "
Notified the candidate when wasn't be elected for the position.
Notification via email once the a decision has been made would be wonderful. 
Notification process and communication was horrible.  The job posting had been modified several times to fit an already identified internal candidates profile.  I thought one of the factors in a role was to remain in the current role for 18 months before considering to move on.  Candidate given the position was only in role for 4 months.  I never received a follow up email communication or anything from J&J or the hiring manager and I am in the same building as the hiring manager--see them on a daily basis.  Very disappointing.

"Not, sure at this time still going through the process of being considered."
"Not, It's a normal process for seeking a better candidate."
Not yet.
Not sure. Perhaps engage with candidates in an informal setting and learn from them. I have been trying to get a J&J for the longest time with no success.  
Not sure. I enjoyed the process
"Not sure.  I ended up withdrawing my application.  However, should i have continued, it would have been important to understand the outcome - a communication that indicated about next steps or that I wasn't going to be considered, etc.  "
"Not sure, I thought the process worked well."
"Not sure yet, I have not received any response since I submitted my application. "
"Not sure why, maybe legal reasons, but I had to answer the same generic question for each role I applied to."
"Not sure why I am asked to do this survey, since I received a message that you were not interested in my experience & skills.  My only interaction was filling out the application, so I am not sure how valuable my input will be.  Thank you."
Not sure the first screen of job position candidate was done by electronic scan or human beings? If the application was carefully evaluated?
"Not sure of the J & J screening process for applicants' CV but after applying for several positions with +20 years of experience in pharmaceutical industry, I have not yet received a call for an interview."
Not sure I was ever dispositioned. A better understanding of the overall process. 
Not sure I found the process quite simple.
Not sure how the screening process works but I wasn't even called for an interview. Makes me wonder what made my application fail the initial review. 
Not sure as only at the beginning of the process. I would encourage feedback following post offer
"Not sure about this because I do not know how is gonna be the entire process. However,  some pratical test and  interview may be the best way to recruit someone. "
"Not sure - employment opportunity was posted on multiple sites, job description and candidate capabilities are informative and detailed, and application process was concise and simple.  "
"Not sending out surveys BEFORE rejecting a candidate's application. 
"
Not send emails to applicants having them perceive they are possibly being chosen to move forward with a hiring process when really its masked under the guise of just filling out a survey
Not received any information with regards to my applications. 
"Not really sure at this point.  Right now all that's happened is that J&J acknowledged receipt of my application and sent me this survey.  It's too early in the process for me to come up with any improvements to it.  Best of luck, though."
Not really any problem. Just a little odd that I would receive a survey about J&J before I heard back on whether or not I got the job. 
Not put my application into the black hole of resumes. 
"Not only do I dislike the hiring process, I have acquired a list of recruiters who feel the same.  If you have worked for the Company two decades ago, a recruiter cannot present you as a candidate.  I could give two dozen people I have worked very closely with at Johnson & Johnson over the past several years, outside of my former experience of am employee, and that does not mean anything.  I can give you ten names of individuals at J&J who highly regard me as a valuable asset.  That does not mean anything.  You really have to get off your superiority wagon.  I am going to start reaching out to these J&J employees who hold high positions in the Company and ask them what the problem is.  I have already done that with one employee who was nigh in the Finance organization and they could not see how I was not even looked at for a phone interview.  It is a total disgrace that a Company I worked for and valued has an HR department full of an elite group of narcissists and a really ""waste-of-time"" application process.  Such a pitty!"
"Not necessarily regarding this position, but communicating more with applicants would improve the process. Even if deciding not to continue with an applicants application, some communication should be sent saying they are no longer being considered instead of leaving them in limbo."
Not much.  It was pretty easy and not time consuming to post for job.
"Not much, overall you have a well designed career website."
"Not much, everybody has kept their word and be very timely reflecting strong integrity. Furthermore, proactively seeking information from me to plan ahead greatly aided communication process. Overall, very pleased with recruitment process thus far."
Not much to add.   I never heard from anyone and did not interview for the positiin
Not much
Not having requirters calling me and e mailing me from INDIA to work for your company.
"not having been on the job market for almost 35 years, I found the application process eye opening and perhaps annoying. But; I believe that to be a product of my not having to use the process before. 
the J&J site is not the most frustrating site I have been on. I would rank it one of the top 3 as far as ease of use.

I would suggest (like) feedback when not being considered for a position. I know this is a lot to ask as I am sure you process more applications than I can imagine in a day...but you did ask.

No changes required. They are the best. 
"No changes needed, just a faster process in moving the candidate forward.  "
no body has reached out to me and communicated about where my interview process has been? All i know is that i applied and next thing i hear is a survey.
No any inprument 
No answer 
No additional comments. The application process and job description was very clear and easy. Thank you for the opportunity to apply and I look forward to the interview process! 
Nil 
New to the Process so far so good.
Never received any feedback.  Could not tell you.  
"Never received an update on the position I applied for.  No ""thank you for considering us"" email. Not friendly. Would never consider to apply again. "
"Never received a phone call or email after my application submission  notify me of where I was at the process.  To date I have only received an email asking me to take a survey.

"
"Never received a call or correspondence regarding my job application. I have since been hired by another organization, though I appreciate the opportunity to give feedback as I was a bit surprised by the lack of professional courtesy.

"Never received a call neither an opportunity for an interview, even when I'm more than qualified for the position "
Never herd from a recruiter 
Never heard from anyone regarding my application 
Never heard from anyone directly.   Only generic emails.  Seems extremely cold and impersonal.  
Never heard from anyone as to the status of interest.
"never heard back, although qualified for the role"
Never heard back regarding application status.
Never heard back from my application. Disappointing that I did not get an email or call one way or another... 
"Never heard anything since I applied, some form of communication would be helpful.  I hear this is a common theme with J & J.  I also received a notice that I had been referred, but I have no idea what that meant."
Never hear from recruiter even though my qualifications match position precisely. 
Never had any clue about what the status of my application process was. 
Never got interview or rejection letter
Never even got a phone screening.
"Never ending technology changes can be learned, but the positive attitude to learn, contribute and help others comes from within. So focus more on candidate’s potential/attitude, rather than their technical experience/expertise."
never been contacted by a recruiter
"Needs to review all resumes that externally applied
"
Needs more of a human touch and personal interaction.  I am a very strong candidate yet did not get an interview.  I cannot help but think my resume was rejected by an automated process vs an actual person reviewing my credentials.  I know I would have been a great fit for the job.
Need updates of applied position
Need to update the progress details to applicant
"Need to take the Clinically experienced people. 
It will be good for the company any time and will develop further in a big way. "
need to promote more on R&D sector for future and also the group must be give a preference on freshers to keep company value as unique  
need to notify the candidate if selected or not by email.
Need to more interactive communication with each applicant.  
Need to know if my application is going to move furthur or not.
Need to have better followup with the candidate and keeping them informed of the timelines and decision.
"Need to get timely feedback. When we complete these applications it takes weeks to months to receive feedback on status of application. If there is an interest to interview the potential applicant, let them know within one week of applying. I'm sure as big a company as J&J is, you have resources in place to make this happen."
Need to evaluate the CV on high priority.
Need to contact the applicant to review his/her experience
Need Timely inform the candidate for his/her status as possible. 
Need Periodic updates with the application process as it moves forward.
need feedback on status
"Need experience holder,who can take challenges and can fulfill company requirement."
need better to have communication with HR
"Need a non-canned answer as to why the application was rejected.  In my case the answer was a generic ""identified a group of candidates that more closely meets the needs of the business"".  No as I meet all those needs as defined in job requisistion, it would be better to know that I might be overqualified for the position (as the requirement is 4 years and I have 18), or there is something missing that you can't fit on a 2 page resume.

"My two cents on this. The same approach to an intuitive application process should be included in the next step - the initial selection process based on the application.  The computer key words discrimination approach allow for a faster selection mode - very useful and needed (maybe) when you have hundreds of applications - but it may lose the ""intuitive"" criteria inherit in more or less degree to all human beings. It's my understanding that the company is loosing extremely valuable opportunities in available resources just in that first step. Nothing like the human eye and ""guts"" for it. Those of us that have been in the business for a while  - probably you - know what we are talking about."
"My thoughts would be to have the application process be a little easier to find. As I struggle to login to my user profile to hear back, etc"
"My suggestion you can try to test the applicant if he or she passed the exam you can hire them, so its not difficult for as to find a job that fits on every profession. "
"My review mainly relates to my interaction with Abbott as the transition to Johnson & Johnson happened in the middle/end of the application process. However, I only have a positive view of Johnson & Johnson at this time. Thank you."
My request is to Jonson and Jonson team that u should tell to applicant why they are not applicable for desired post.what kind of things they should add in the resume.
"My recommendation to Recruitment Dpt in general is that when releasing a new tool (like my Next Step) ensure that the information that the system provides on application status is up to date. In several ocassions I received emails notifications that are not aligned with the application status on the system. In my point of view the system will be helpful if the information included is up to date, if not will be creating confusion among the users.  Thanks, MAritza Ramos"
"My recent interview may have been conducted outside the normal recruitment process, being the first interview and other candidates not yet identified.  Would have been better if other interviews could have taken place near the time of mine.  I expect it will take some time to locate comparable candidates with similar experience, delaying the selection process. Also, because of this delay, the agenda for these subsequent interviews may change, influencing hiring decisions.  

   "
My overall experience during the recruitment process was very good so far. No further comments! 
My opinion of the recruitment process is the process is very effective. I think the response time could be improved whether it is to move to the next step or declining an applicant. 
My opinion is they need more visibility in our community. They have a great reputation and brand presence certainly a company anyone would be proud to state they had them as their employer.  Having them featured more prominently in the community would help them with their recruitment.  Thank you for asking!  Chris Hall
My only suggestion would be to include the credo more prominently in the initial applicant contact/job opportunity details. It differentiates Johnson & Johnson from other employers. 
"My only suggestion would be to have a little more flexibility with some of the requirements for the position.  With more than 19 years of pharmaceutical, medical device and OTC experience I felt that I was a good candidate for the position of Sr Manager, Operations Engineering but since I do not have green belt cert I was rejected.  I have taken green belt classes and utilize 6s principles but was not considered because of the lack of certification.  Regardless of that I would still recommend J&J as a company to work."
"My only suggestion is that the email soliciting this survey feedback was a bit of a dissapointment.    I thought I was being invited to interview, but alas, it was just this survey."
My only recommendation would be a quicker turnaround once a decision is made but that may not apply here as the role was supposedly cancelled per the email I received. 
My only recommendation is decreasing the response time. 
My only experience with J&J recruiting is through the portal.  The portal worked well and was easy to navigate.
My only comment on the recruit process is to keep up the good work. The application process was very smooth and intuitive. This is very attractive to job seekers because it gets directly to the nuts and bolts of applying without making the process long and cumbersome. 
"My one minor comment would be that this survey came pretty early in the application process for me.  I am still waiting to hear back about my application so receiving an email with the subject ""we'd like to hear from you"" got me excited about the recruiting process.  I might consider sending out the survey after applicants have heard back or altering the subject to make the feedback nature of the email clear from the beginning.  Thank you!"
"My name is Robert Liska, I have 18 years of surgical/medical sales experience in Operating Room sales, and really interested to work for J&J. I have applied for position the Ethicon Sales Representative  Bariatric Thoracic (Bt) (Northern Nj.)  Ethicon Us Llc (4873170316).  My wife is a nurse 22 years at Robert Wood Johnson Hospital and my brother Walter Liska works at J&J Morris Plains, NJ for 13+ years and would like to refer me, however he is a IT programmer contractor.

My gentle suggestion is to consider additionally the qualifications & experiences in the related field which are not listed in the job description. 
"My first request:  More communication with each step of the process:  (a) Application received; (b) Application forwarded to hiring manager; (c) Initial screenings complete; and (d) Initial candidates identified (this one would need to include a disclaimer that even if you're not selected as an initial candidate, your candidacy is still active).  At any point along the way - immediate notification if your candidacy is not going to advance (rather than waiting until the end).  My second request:  If something is listed as ""preferred"" in the posting, it should not be used as a screening question during the on-line application.  For example - this specific job stated 3yrs CNS experience preferred and 2yrs CNS injectable experience preferred.  Yet these were both included as Yes/No questions during the online screening process.  I understand the answers to these questions are used to weed out candidates.  Since the attributes were preferred, not required, they should not be used to weed out candidates who may not have that level of experience - OR - the job posting should state they are required attributes.  Thank you."
"My first experience has been very good. At the moment, I have no suggestions ;-)

Cheers!"
"My exposure to Johnson& Johnson was limited only to the online application process.  J&J's process is on a par with other large organizations. If you would like to bring me in for an interview where we may further discuss how I may help your organization, I will be happy to offer more in depth recommendations on how the recruitment process may be improved.  Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Mark Tender

My experience with the recruitment process has only been positive. The recruiter reached out to me in a timely manner and made it easy to schedule and initial interview. My information was then quickly passed to the hiring manager and I heard from her within a couple of days. It has been a smooth process throughout.
"My experience with Johnson & Johnson recruitment was a straight forward and easy to follow process, without much hassle. To me the whole process was smooth and pleasant one. Thank you."
"My experience with J&J recruiting process has been very brief and I usually do not formulate opinions this early in any process.

Erich"
My experience was great. very easy and smooth.
My experience thus far in the recruitment process has been very positive. 
My experience thus far has been excellent. I do not have any suggestions for improvement. 
"My experience seeking out internal opportunities and professional development within Johnson and Johnson over the last 6 years has been terrible. After multiple attempts to reach out to internal recruiters to get more information regarding available roles, I've received 0 responses and no acknowledgment of my interest to develop and grow within the company.  The process for seeking out available roles needs to be much more intuitive and internal recruiters need to be much better with responding to interested candidates. "
"My experience at this point has been good, so no comment at the moment."
"My experience and success in the healthcare, sales space is outstanding and my background is unique. J & J couldn't have seriously looked at my CV. However, I do understand with the large numbers of applicants it would be near impossible and superior candidates will and have slipped through the cracks."
"My experience and qualification fully inline with job description. I believe I was not call for interview due to fact that I,m emigrant and women. "
"My application was submitted over a month and a half ago and I was notified that I was not selected via automated email over a month ago, so I don't remember much detail regarding the recruitment process itself.  However, as the timeline I describe above suggests, the timeliness of status updates and survey requests would be a good place to look for opportunities to improve."
My application was declined but it was rather quick. Was this position already predetermined?
"My application is still in the initial stages: however, the application portal should allow to manually create a profile instead of just pulling out details from social profiles already created."
"My application for employment has been placed however I have not received any feedback regarding position.  

Improve communication with candidates if position is still opened or closed

"
move things along faster
Move the process along quickly.
Move faster. 
most personal process 
"Most job seekers hang on to hope because they get an auto-response that offers no time-frame for a potential job interview. That said, aknowledging a job application and offering a response time-frame is a polite thing to do."
Most companies don't do this and I cannot understand why: candidates deserve to know when they are not selected. J&J should be able to provide with an automated email letting candidates know whether or not they are moving on to the next phase. 
More/faster Followup
"More, better and faster personal contact with candidates."
More visibility to the decision making process.
More updates through out the candidate process. Like a time-line that marks small milestones I.e. Application received -&gt; application being reviewed -&gt; etc.
More updates on where they are with the job. If you do not get an interview it would be nice to know instead of waiting weeks to find out.
More updates on the stays of the process 
More updates on status of application. 
More updates about the status of the application and where the applicant is in the process
More transparent in application evaluation and provide timely feedback
"More transparency is required, personal feedback even if the candidate has not been selected (with clear reason why he/she is not a good fit for the position) - automated replies are not an option for candidates..."
More transparency into the status of the application. Also market comparison of position's title to other organizations in the area. 
More transparency during the hiring process.
More transparency and communication.  Create a website with easy codes to let people know where they are in the process.  Not happening now.
"More timely/thorough responses to applicants.  I have applied for 3 positions, and only received feedback (an initial phone screen and phone interview with the hiring Manager).  Otherwise, I have received no response(s) to my applications."
More timely responses.
More timely response to job application received.
More timely response to application submission.
More timely response to applicants about the status of their application.
more timely response on job status.
More timely response in status. I applied 5 weeks ago and haven't heard anything back. But I am happy to complete this survey.
More timely response 
"More timely responces 
I have applied for several jobs and have not heard whether I will get an interview or not
Not much updates as to where my application is in the process
Limited to no feedback as to why I was not selected for the position"
"More timely follow-up.  Been through two rounds and 7 interviews.  Been 10 business days since completing round 2.  Have not heard anything despite contact with hiring director. For the amount of time invested in competing, the professional courtesy of a status update would be quite welcomed.  "

More timely follow up
More timely feedback.

"More person to person .

Thanks "
More permanent  opportunities 
More periodic communication beyond an automated response that my application was received would be appreciated.
More outreach to career fairs and online recruitment sessions. 
More opportunities to express intrest in position opening and to actively reach out for phone interview.
More open communication about selection process and application status would be helpful. It would be ideal to have an online system that allows candidates to monitor their status as HR and managers make their way through the applications. 
More online status updates weekly!
More on campus recruiting for schools that may not be target schools. 
More on campus recruiting efforts would definitely raise awareness and knowledge about the recruitment process.
More of a response from the company regarding next steps rather than just a feeling of dropping a resume into an electronic abyss. 
"More notifications. Tell candidates that at their applications have been received, that they have/ haven't been chosen for an interview, that they have/ haven't been chosen for the position. This survey request is the first communication I have had related to this position. I am assuming that is because the position has been filled, and this is part of a post-mortem. That may be incorrect, but that is the perception this communications style gives. "
More notifications along the way on what stage you are at.
More mode of channels for advertising the job vacancies. It's best to use the social media to promote the vancancies.
"More mobile options, like LinkedIn's one-click apply."
More military outreach outside the normal career fairs. A lot of highly skilled qualified professionals didn't graduate from a military academy and would do wonders for your company. 
More Linkedin Exposure /Posting 
More job opportunities for locations such as Puerto Rico.
More interviews than only take decisions of recruitment only based on Curruculum vitae .
more interactions with potential candidates.
more interaction.
More insight on the timeline

"more information and opportunity on linkedin, indeed and monster
1 click apply or easy apply permit"

More human touch than automation
More human interaction in the earliest stages.
More human contact and less electronic communications 
More friendly representatives at career fairs for The Ohio State University 
more frequently update 
More frequent updates would be great
More frequent updates post-interview.
More frequent updates on the status of my job application
More frequent updates on hiring process.
"More frequent updates from hiring/recruiting managers, allowing people to stay up-to-date with the status of their active submissions"
More frequent communications on the review process
"More frequent communications on status, for instance, if resume is actively being reviewed, not selected, awaiting review, etc."
More frequent communication.  Example: I was asked to fill out this survey but have not heard if I am under consideration for the Engineering Manager position.
More frequent communication throughout the process. 
More frequent communication regarding application status 
More frequent application updates
more follow-up on internal candidates
More follow-up emails to let the candidate know if he/she is in consideration
More follow up by recruiters.  many phone calls and messages go unanswered.

"more feedback, plus shocked I did not at least get phone interview
"
More feedback to the appliances 
"More feedback on the status of the application. Even if the applicant doesn't get the job, it's nice to know. "
More feedback on the expected timing of make the final selection for the new position.  I still have not heard if I did not get the job 
"More feedback on positions applied (more than a yes, no, or ignoring the applicant {experience from other organizations, not J&J}). At one point the website seemed to be grey'd out so I couldn't put in an application. The help desk was very helpful in resolving it with me. Very professional. This reflected positively on my experience. "
"More feedback on application. For new graduates, this would be beneficial. A simple we went with more qualified applicants seems like a we don't know why we did not pursue you further."
More feedback for candidates is always a good thing. Be that a position is no longer available or information on what factors one could work towards improving so that they might become a better candidate should a future position become available.
More feedback after submitting for a position. 
More face to face interviews would help the process. Variety is always needed and the best way to show that is a face to face interview. 
More face to face contact
More engagement from recruiters
More efforts should be made to advertise-to/inform/educate the public about career opportunities like this.
More diversity will be great.
"More direct exposure to HR for established terminal level degree professional (MD, DMD, DVM and selected PhD) ."
"More direct contact, if phone call not possible, then regular email updates as to status will help canddiates who may be pursuing other positions as well. Thanks."
More detailed description of duties
More detail regarding position (territory size or number of teammates) would be nice to see for someone like myself who is interested in seeing how I would fit into the role outside of a job description.
More detail in the rol objectives.
More context and information on the status. 
"More contact with candidates. I am a very strong candidate for this role & similar roles that I have applied to in the past. Yet, I have never been contacted, even once, for the 40+ roles applied for."
More contact / notification of application process.
"More consistent feedback on status of role. Include specific job responsibilities of role beyond generic outline, include approx. percentage of responsibilities."
"More communicative during applications process.  I applied online, had a friend refer me, and did not receive a response until I was told I was not the right fit for the role in an automated email.

More honest and specific feedback as to why someone did not make it to the interview process.  Such feedback can help a candidate to improve their resume or application approach."
More communications with applicants throughout the process
"More communication.  I submitted my application, then got this survey a few days later.  Have I been rejected?  Am I advancing in the process?  I have no idea."
More communication.
More communication with the recruitment team
More communication with candidates. Time for when candidate will hear back about an opportunity post interview. 
More communication with applicants 
More communication via phone and or email regarding status.
More communication throughout the process.
More communication regarding the application process and expectations.
"More communication or notifications with regards to my application and the stage it is currently under. For example, I applied to Senior Associate Scientist, Oncology Discovery (4310170308) and I have only observed ""Resume received"" and ""Completed"" for the application status. The application has been ""Completed"" for over a month but no ""regrets"" letter received. "
more communication on timelines or estimates of timelines as for weeks you hear no communication updates and unsure of the status of the job itself or there are delays or perhaps the expectation is that it will take a few months
More communication on the processing time of the application selection process
More communication is better.  And reporting where I am in the process would be a important point.
More communication is always better.  Understanding my status over time is greatly appreciated.
More Communication in all the process . 
More communication if the position is still open. 
More communication during process and follow up.
More communication between applicant and recruiter
More communication about the process.  I was rejected but was not told why.   I thought my skills matched very well with what J&J was looking for.
more communication
more communication
"More communication
"
More clear verbal feedback to canidates so that they can learn and improve in the same light as what this survey is providing to J&J. 
More clear and precise answer to employment opportunity thank you  
More alerts about the status of process
More agreement between mainland and Puerto Rico candidate reviews.
More advertising 
More advertisements customized to individual search recruits.
"More access to recruiter - have ""live chat "" timeframe and option on the website."
"More 'in-process' status feedback. App rec'd, under review, submitted to hiring manager,  etc."
"More ""remote"" work available."
Monitor website issues more regularly. There was a bug in starting the application by importing my profile from LinkedIn.
"Minimize number of questions/simplify the application process. Inform every candidate who applied for open position if he has not been chosen to move forward with the interview process. Quite often there is no a feedback at all other than "" completed"" or ""no longer accepting applications"" status on the career tracking section."
Mine new employees for future talent since new employees are a wealth of information about other people too. Talk to new hires about their network. 
Might be useful to include a tracker on the career site to see the status and track the progress of an application.
mentioning the hiring manager that candidates can ask earlier to application
Memberikan kesempatan untuk Kandidat untuk bisa mengetahui tentang Perusahaan dan Produk lebih dalam lagi dengan melakukan Trainning dan Studi  Banding terima kasih. 
"Meet with me and preapprove my qualifications, then guide me to a functional area/ role and allow me a better chance at actual J+J employment.  Thanks"
Meet us in person rather than using a recruitment computer system to choose. 
Meet candidates as considerable as possible sometimes the CV may not speak out every aspect of experience and individuals personality.
Meet candidate in person on final interview.
Measure the process time.
"Maybe, provide a Link to J & J's Career section and or one that shows the current status of our application & position.  Otherwise, no flaws whatsoever."
Maybe to speed up the recruitment process a little bit? I submitted the applications 3 weeks ago but haven't received feedback yet
Maybe to follow up with candidates who have applied in more timely manner 
"Maybe think about broadening your search parameters.  What I mean by that is most if not all companies selling a product require their reps to have some sort of sales experience.  Its a logical requirement.  But there are those that fall outside of the specifications your company covets.  People in other professions that aren't involved with direct selling, but have the traits, qualities, perspective, and life/work experience that just might make a very good salesman for your company.  Step outside the box!"
"Maybe take a little more time to assess candidates' fitness for the role using some foresight - I've been performing customer insight research for high-dollar clients and major brands for many years, and I received the standard rejection letter just 14 minutes after submitting the application for a position that encompasses just that skill set. That's got to be a new record! Not sour grapes over the rejection, happens all the time, but the speed and casualness with which it was delivered speaks to the cavalier way candidates, especially for a senior position, are treated. Might be time to review the consideration process . . ."
Maybe respond and give update on application status before sending a survey to ask about the process.
Maybe reply to candidates sooner if they are being considered or not for the position. But I know it's a very large company and that may not be so easy. Overall it is great. 
"Maybe provide some feedback as to how my resume and application is pending. What stage am I in? That is, am I still being considered? Or, am I in the discard pile subject to the current offer being accepted by another person? Is there a delay on filing the position due to some internal delay? Often, I never hear back after applying. "
"Maybe place their open positions on more job boards, because the information may attract candidates from other sections of the country that may be interested in moving to another area near family members."
Maybe leaving a time of when available to contact if recruiter not able to reach candidate.  Other than that recruiter was very informative.
Maybe just providing feedback to applicants regarding why they aren't a fit for the position. I have applied to at least five openings and haven't heard back one way or the other. 
Maybe just keep us posted on the job we applied for updates or a feedback on the position Thank you Sylvia Estrada 
Maybe Johnson & Johnson can accept a video from the candidate to analyze his skills
Maybe include some videos of actual employees explaining their experiences and success.
Maybe improve the recruitment processing time?
"Maybe have more positions available or training programs to allow prospective applicants to gain the necessary skillets needed in J&J. It can work like a condition-based training. If the applicant does the training, it helps secure employment."
"Maybe do not dismiss candidates that do not have 100% criteria match so readily. There is a lot of talent out in the world and rarely does every external candidate fit 100%
"
"Maybe choose the best candidates and conduct a Skype interview, since some qualities can not be described but rather perceived during an interview."
Maybe by increasing the advertisement procedures. 
"Maybe Applicants could be notified in a timely manner if not selected for next step..

Thanks!"
maybe add why candidate not qualified? Whether it's visa issue or resume issue?
Maybe add Video Interview. With 5 or 8 questions.
Maybe a tad shorter job description but versus other applications I have filled out JNJ's process was relatively simple 
Maybe a little more information about the process of my aplication
Maybe a good idea to indicate tentative start date on the job posting
May I know why I was not selected? Is it possible to know what I need to do in order to be part of your organization that I admire the most? 
"May be include high level questions that support the role and the experience candidate you are seeking. 

For example, what was the last book you read and why? 

In this role, what do you think is the key skill set required in order to be successful? "
May be by adding tracking lines
May be a courtesy phone call for personal connection/satisfaction immediate after receiving the application. Machine can not replace human bonding
Match the required skills of the candidates and provide a telephonic interview before the final round of the recruiting process
"Many times, from the applicant's standpoint, an application is submitted and then there is no further contact regarding the position.  It would be helpful to receive correspondence letting the applicant know where things are in the process.  If the applicant is not being considered, an email letting them know that would reduce frustrating.  If the applicant is still in the running but the process is going on longer than intended, an email stating such would be nice.  It can be a very frustrating process for applicants the way the process is currently configured."
"Many times the application process seems to get lost from the point of application to the recruitment department ( an actual person ) responding.

This is true for all Corporations not just J & J.

"
"Many talented individuals are ignored because of the ATS. Recommendation -
probably initial online behavioral interview is better than a software scanning the resumes. "
"Many sites (Intelligrated, GE, Luxottica and others) have a central location where one can see what roles they have applied for and their status.  Would be great to replicate this on the J&J Career Site."
"Many roles related to the one I applied for were present, with very little distinction between them.  

Additionally the process of submitting to your automated system seems depersonalized.  I know that my information has been received, but I don't know when or if someone will get back to me and on what timeframe. "
Many of these positions matches my skills and i don't hear back the real reason for not being suitable for the position. I sometimes feel the postings are fake postings to fill in candidates internally available. I hope that is not the case..
"Many highly talented but unemployed professional engineers and scientists are available in the job market. J&J is one of the major US medical device and pharmaceutical employers, hopefully it has the capability to recognize and pick these professionals."
"Many companies, including J&J are posting job specs that get too specific about the experience and in this could overlook opportunities to hire candidates that have better potential to succeed in the role.
"
"Many companies will have a referral candidate speak to a recruiter or hiring manager, J & J did not. Very unprofessional. Would not recommend to a friend looking for a position."
"Many companies use the same vendors to process applications, so there is nothing particular that stood out to make the experience particularly memorable.  As is true with most things, the applications that are particularly painful to fill out tend to be memorable (like the ones that have required fields like street address for my high school, or detailed contact info for references, even though I am only tossing my hat in the ring).  Keep up the good work and you will continue to retain the trust and respect that you command today."
Many candidates apply to lot of companies there minimum hope is reply from companies whether there are selected to the particular job or not. Johnson & Johnson is the first site I have seen sending a reply to the candidate taking very less time that is really thoughtful about your company. I thank you for your hard work in this part. There is nothing much to improve according to me.
Manually screen resumes and applications as there is no reasonable answer as to why I was not at the very least phone screened with my 30 years of experience and 6 national sales awards!!!
manual walkins
manage expectations on when to hear back from hiring managers or recruiters. 
Making their job announcements more noticeable. 
"Making recruiters and/or hiring managers and professionals more accessible. personally I like being able to talk face to face about a position and my qualifications, and while the application was intuitive it was hard to find someone to talk to about the opportunity in person. "

Make this more viable and easy for internal canididates to apply and notification of these openings in the same plant we work in.
Make the resume submission more streamlined.

Make the recruitment process more personable.
Make the process more transparent so that applicants know where they stand in the overall hiring process.
Make the process more streamlined. It takes too long to find out if J&J is or isn't interested in the applicant.

"Make the application process more personal.  You miss out on excellent candidates when you rely solely on an ATS application. 
I had a call with a recruiter from J&J who said someone would be in touch with me and I never heard from anyone!
"
Make the application process easier with better utilization of the applicant resume versus fill in steps
"Make sure your ATS (Applicant Tracking System) algorithms are not screening out potentially great candidates. For example: some systems don't recognize plural versions of keywords or they have other subtle nuances that cause a perfectly good candidate to get ""rejected"" due to the way the ATS interprets the data."
Make sure you are keeping candidates up to to date. As a candidate this is the first I am hearing back outside of the automated email stating my application was received. I think it's important to let applicants know if the position has been filled or if they aren't a good fit as soon as possible. 
Make sure the recruitment manager returns your calls.
Make sure the recruiters email or contact the applicant to let them know if they are eligible or not
Make sure the job applicants are notified when the position has been filled in a timely manner.
"Make sure that all applicants receive feedback timely, positive or negative"
Make sure follow up with candidate is firm and clear. This is whether or not an offer is made or not. 
make process transparent 
Make process faster
"Make phone follow up with internal jnj candidate
Big miss!"
make me an offer:)
Make less questions!
make it wait shorter
Make it so the application process is more fine tuned and streamlined so as not to drag on for months. 
Make it simple (KISS). Its far to cumbersome to apply. J&J is lost from a candidate UI/UX  perspective. Follow what other simpler systems such as LinkedIn /Indeed and others do. Once again KISS.
Make it shorter.  It does J&J no favors to put candidates though a long and arduous application process and then turn around in the blink of an eye and say you won't be considered. You lose out on good candidates who don't want to put in the effort for that kind of treatment.
Make it more rapid. It takes too long between steps.
Make it more personal.  I'm not just a regular candidate-lots of relevant experience & an unmatched track record.  Make it personal to your great candidates.
"Make it more personable instead of having a computer decide if you are qualified and then send you multiple emails asking for feedback on the process. There is no process other than see a post, apply, get automatic email telling you your 20 years of experience isn't worth a look.  This is the same company who hires me as a consultant to lead strategic workshops with senior management for its most important pharma product, yet in 2 years of applying for positions never once had someone contact me to see how I might be a fit for another role or future position.

"Make it more easy to find, or find ways to announce job openings to the public."
Make it faster.  Reply and offer me the job faster.  :-)
Make it faster
Make it easier to log in into your profile.
Make it easier to get feedback about the status of an application.
Make it easier to copy and paste a resume.
"Make it easier to apply by just being able to upload your resume and answer less questions. When candidates are searching for a job you could easily apply for 100 or more jobs in a month. That said it is extremely frustrating to spend almost an hour on an application just to find out you are not even going to get a phone call from HR. While, I understand that you have to weed out people from all of the applications I still think it could be more efficient. "
Make it easier for top candidates to get a response.
Make it easier for fresh graduates to apply and ease out the application procedure by truly have someone look at their resume and not a bot!
"Make it clear in the application that if you worked for J&J before, and was downsized and received a severance, that you should not bother to complete the application.  This is what happened to me and I was rejected from consideration shortly after I applied.

I am a former ""Legacy Synthes"" employee who had worked for Synthes for 12+ years in Quality Assurance. As you probably know, J&J acquired Synthes and matched us up with DePuy.  Just about all of the Quality department legacy Synthes employees were eliminated, including my former supervisor and myself -- three months later.  I had worked for him for 10 years and he was a great boss to work with.  

When I saw this particular position, I was not sure if I should attempt to apply for it, since I was downsized last March, along with most -- if not all -- of my former colleagues.  It was a bittersweet moment when I received the rejection soon after my application for this position. It confirmed that I was either on a ""do not rehire"" list or that the former person who let me go put a bad mark in my record.   (I have heard that this can happen in the Pharma and Med Device industry).  

I still do not understand why my position was eliminated, but that's the way business works now and I understand that the ""older"" workers make too much and the companies want to save money.  I am appreciative that I received a severance and that most of the J&J employees were professional  A very smart person once said, ""never let your employees know that you don't like them.""  That was the lasting impression that I had from the person who I helped during the last few months of working at J&J. 

Thank you for reading this and for the survey.

In some instances you are informed you didn't get the job but most of the time there are no updates.

Looks all good.
"Looking for people that will be a good fit for the job has to be very hard to do. I, myself, think that a person attitude is the single most important part of a great employee. Of course work ethic and honest are very good traits, but a person can literally know everything there is to know about the product or service, but with a poor attitude that person will not succeed!

"Look people, and not just look at the automated online process.  I think you are missing great candidates because of that"
Look outside the box!
Look more deeply into a person background and skill sets more than just the surface things you find on a resume. It is very important to sometimes dig deeper into a person to find out if there is more that can be quantified on a resume. 
Look for talent also at senior levels.
Look for individuals who is willing to go the extra mile and truly believe in the product that they are producing.  Look outside the norm. 
look at the applicants ability to change industries to apply different skill sets to any current opportunities..encourage applicants from different areas to apply.

"LinkedIn integration is not working properly. It gives the option to pull the resume from there but then the page freezes. I tried about three times the. I gave up and applied through the company's website. Other than that, the process was pretty standard compared to other corporations. Thanks for the opportunity. Have a great day. "
Linkedin Easy Apply is nice
Link clear emails back to the applicant so they know whether they are in consideration. 
Limiting the info needed each time i apply. 
"Limit the required qualifications to the critical few that are ""must have"" or break them into Required & Desired.   Candidates can assess a match with the Required items and intelligently decide to apply or not.  "
"Like most recruitment sites they ask for your resume which is great. But also, a lot of sites ask for previous positons again. I think this it is redundant when asked to fill out again where you have worked when the resume has already been provided. "
Like most recruiting systems more communication about the process would be helpful.  It's frustrating to never truly know the status or where your stand.
"Like many large firms, J&J is using contractors extensively in many varied roles and I would recommend using this as a potential pipeline for recruiting where non-compete clauses are not applicable."
"Like any other process, there is always an opportunity to improve in the areas of timeliness and communication, because people do appreciate a well timed response to their inquiries and applications."
Let your applicants know if they didn't move on in the application process.

Johnson n johnson should contact immediately for candidates who they think are suitable ..perhaps arrange transport ..or maybe give candidates free airticket  and a place to stay to travel for their interview if they live abroad .  well if they can afford too...i know it sounds strange depending on how qualified or creative or hardworking the candidate is..
"Johnson n Johnson is a multinational corporation. The recruitment process takes place through clear phases. This makes the applicants feel comfortable as they know that the decision making personnel are being completely objective during taking such important life changing decisions.
As perfection has no ceiling, there is always some space for improvement. In my opinion, the best improvement that can take place is to add a set of questions to the application. These questions can help the recruiters get a more solid idea about the applicant regarding: attitude, the sincere will to join J&J family, problem solving and crisis management ability.
Best regards."
"Johnson and Johnson's recruitment process is handled very professionally, the only concern I have is with the online interview process since I had to interview multiple times via skype. 

Overall the experience went well as expected. "
"Johnson and Johnson should perform a written test along with oral presentation on research based topic.

"
"Johnson and Johnson should continue conducting it's recruitment process as it is currently doing so; communicating with the job candidates , thereby facilitating the application process ."
Johnson and Johnson is one of the best companies to work for and I am really looking forward for a call from the HR. Thank you for considering me. 
"Johnson and Johnson is my dream company.

Recruitment process is awesome and great!. 

Ms.Dalia, Ms.Farrah, Mr.Yatin and Payroll team were wonderful to work with."
"Johnson and Johnson has an amazing reputation and it would be an honor to be associated with such a fine organization.  I appreciated the use of technology to participate in a webcast panel interview, as it is more cost effective to those participating.  I look forward to hearing about my candidacy, and if I am not the appropriate candidate, I hope that I might be considered for other opportunities in the future.  Thank you for the opportunity and for consistent communication."
"Johnson and Johnson has a very easy and transparent application process. The process of applying for different positions is very well designed. Most would assume a company like Johnson and Johnson would be very strategic and tedious, but the application process was extremely progressive and easy. I have no real experience with the recruitment process because I have never spoken to any representatives from Johnson and Johnson. If the recruitment process is like the application process, it is awesome!
Thanks,
Candace Richardson"
"Johnson and Johnson does a nice job in the recruitment and posting process.  Sometimes I have difficultly and do not get notification of opportunities in or near my area.  A great way to improve the process would  be to give me an opportunity to interview for this position as I bring an extremely successful career in different industries, as well as subset positions within those industries."
Johnson and Johnson could send out more job alerts that closely fit with the applicant resume with high chances of being interviewed.
Johnson and Johnson could emphasize on growth and development :)
"Johnson and Johnson could contact applicants about their application in a more timely fashion.  It has been several weeks since I applied and I still have not heard from anyone regarding an interview, while the other employers I applied with have all scheduled or completed an interview already.  "

Johnson and Johnson can hire me
Johnson and Johnson can have a mechanism in place whereby candidates can track their application progress with a defined schedule.
Johnson & Johnson's reputation is the best recruitment tool. I have not gone through the entire recruitment process and cannot yet speak in detail about it. So far so good...
"Johnson & Johnson's recruitment prices was on par or better than others that I have gone through recently. I do not currently remember all of the details of your process, but I do not believe any changes were necessary"
"Johnson & Johnson would improve using different channels to give information about recruitment process also in my own country  Colombia, there is an opportunity to improve application process."
Johnson & Johnson shows excellent recruitment process. I do not have opinions to this. 
Johnson & Johnson should send said survey directly following successful application completion. 
Johnson & Johnson should hire me as their next Pharamceutical Representative to complete this recruitment process because I am the best candidate for the position. Thank You
Johnson & Johnson should give opportunities to new and entry level applicants specially immigrants who has proven their skills in their home country and trying to build their new career.
Johnson & Johnson should give a feed back to the candidate regarding their application. 
Johnson & Johnson should consider reaching back to people sooner. 
Johnson & Johnson recruitment doesn't require any improvement because it was itself in its perfect shape with the very easy and understood process of the application.
"Johnson & Johnson obviously has the name and products to spark interest in any sales professional. It is always helpful when companies can be very specific in what they are looking for in a sales representative.

Culture is very important and fitting in makes all the difference in the world.  "
Johnson & Johnson must have more effective tools to make the surveys in based in the person individually. In this manner the company can improve their metrics and effectiveness of this tasks.
Johnson & Johnson more in person contact.
Johnson & Johnson is presently on the same path as most companies at this stage of the recruitment process.
"Johnson & Johnson is one of the leading company in the market. In my opinion the recruitment process adopted by the company is very comprehensive. In my consideration it is one of the best methods adopted by the world's top ranked companies. However the turn around time of the process might be reduced with the help of short listing of the candidates and further swiftly contacting the short listed candidates.

Johnson & Johnson is insightful and innovative in its recruitment process.  They appear to work to find the team member that will fit all aspects of the role.  The commitment to recruiting and buildiing character is crucial and Johnson & Johnson appears to look for that as well as the desired skill sets.
Johnson & Johnson is big a bog company in world.There are many excellent employee who work hard and make good statergy .I can advice on it as it is not my business.I Have experience of selling drug. But everything is fine and good .Thanks  
"Johnson & Johnson is a major employer. I understand that it would be hard to contact all applicants. I do think, that some of the outside sales positions need to be interviewed. I would hope that J&J is also seeking professional Acum along with the passion to achieve their goals. I feel that if that is missing, the employee is just collecting a check until they expire. Yes, obstacles have to be over come. Building relationships is the only way to obtain your goal. Being able to leave the facility and they remember you. Some people, no matter what they do can not leave a lasting impression with the facility. From my observation, without the passion for the company and the product along with understanding the needs of the facility, failure will result.  Two employers had asked me why a co worker could not do what I was able to do. They must  show confidence in the product or they can not excel. Computers are great for follow up but eye to eye contact and building relationships is crucial.
Thank you for asking and I do hope to hear from J&J shortly.

"Johnson & Johnson indeed has a great recruitment process. If company can also let potential candidates visit its campus/facility in advance, it would help in understanding the culture and work environment in great depth. Also, it would help candidates meet the current employees and learn from their experiences, and decide which team and projects are the best fit for them."
Johnson & Johnson HR should meet with the interested and professional candidates at least once to know about their interest and asses their dedication in the relevant job. This will further help in their recruitment process for identification of right person. 
"Johnson & Johnson has one of the best career platforms and application processes of any major company I've applied for. One potential area to improve would be transparency and allow the applicant to see the status (under initial review, hiring manager review, etc). "
"Johnson & Johnson has exceptional recruitment process for online applications. The questions were clearly formed and well-organised. My only suggestion is to send a feedback for the application status in a timely manner, which will be highly appreciated by the applicants. "
Johnson & Johnson has done a great job describing their values and foundation and what they can offer individuals looking to advance their careers. I feel their recruitment process is better than most companies I've experienced before.
"Johnson & Johnson has done a great job at the recruitment process! However, the recruitment process can be improved by improving the timeline of the hiring process. "
"Johnson & Johnson has an excellent reputation in the American public.  The company is perceived as conservative yet forward-thinking, progressive, and professional.  Leverage that brand by keeping the hiring process well organized, nimble, and expeditious.

Keep postings up to date.  In April 2017, I found two postings for the Cornelia, GA operations that were dated October 2016 and January 2017.  Such dated postings may call into question an employer's level of commitment and/or ability to understand its hiring needs.

Provide feedback to applicants on a more timely basis.  When highly qualified applicants receive no feedback over an extended period regarding the status of the posting or their standing with respect to the candidate pool, they may question the pace of business that an employer considers to be acceptable.  They may also question the level of respect that an employer has for people in general, not to mention its own employees.

Overall, I've found the recruitment process to be about average.  But, Johnson & Johnson is far better than average.  Seize the opportunity."
"Johnson & Johnson has a premium reputation, and I would love to work for the company. I felt I was well qualified for this position based on my previous professional experience.  I would love to speak with a recruiter or human resources professional to ascertain how I can better position myself to work for Johnson & Johnson."
"Johnson & Johnson has a great reputation, which means that your processes are working. Personally, I haven't had any issues. "
Johnson & Johnson had one of the better recruitment processes than most other companies. Keep up the good work!
Johnson & Johnson did an incredible job of reviewing and responding to my application. I think it'd be neat to include a quick video (30 seconds or less) about the development program on the application.
Johnson & Johnson could provide more updates on the process of your application. 
Johnson & Johnson could keep the applicant informed at every stage of the selection process.
"Johnson & Johnson could improve its recruitment process by creating an initial online video interview for top candidates. I've used Hire-Vue for other companies and as a job seeker it allows me to showcase my intelligence and human side by answering several questions pertinent to the positions, which I believe recruiting algorithms fail to encapsulate. Although algorithms are cost effective and potentially a great sorting tool it limits a company's image and brand. 

The more Johnson & Johnson can weave a human element into its recruitment process the better. Otherwise the recruitment process like most other organizations becomes a black hole process leaving job seekers with little understanding of why they were or were not selected to interview. 

Lastly, the proverbial ""we regret to inform"" letter from many business (with do not reply) with no feedback is not ideal. Clearly, writing thousands of emails to candidates is unrealistic too, however creating a scoring system based on qualifications would be well served. For instance, a 1-5 score for areas deemed important for the role or more specifically deficient candidate areas would most likely result in better informed candidates and a reduction in unqualified applicant submissions. Also, being notified that the position was canceled is helpful for candidates too.

Lastly, introducing networking events or expos where candidates can meet your recruitment team is always a great idea, because it allows an informal meeting where both parties have an opportunity to interview each other and understand cultures and professional expectations. 

Good luck to you and your team. 

All the best, Paul David Walbrun"
"Johnson & Johnson could improve it's recruitment process by sending their open positions to Universities to share with their students. I only found the open position after looking only online, and would have missed it if I only looked at the job bulletin and job alerts at my university."
Johnson & Johnson could hold job fairs and make major announcements by  advertising on local radio stations so you can reach the most qualified people.  You could also notify or sent out letters to local places in the community including churches to help notify people of specific job openings.  I think this will improve your position in the community also create a groups to network with on social media and include community leaders in this networking group as well as attend the job fairs as a recruiting initiative.  I think this could assist you in the recruitment process.  
"Johnson & Johnson could better their recruiting process by reaching targeted  audiences using web technologies and employee referrals. Managing the entire recruitment operations at Johnson & Johnson should entail a functioning organization site that is adequate; design suitable job description that emphases the knowledge, skills and abilities needed for every available job opening; identify the best timing for recruitment and who should be recruited after series of interviews such as phone and face to face. Adequate communication with prospective employees is vital. "
Johnson & Johnson could advertise their internship/co-op opportunities online such as social media
Johnson & Johnson career is easy to use and job description are very clear. 
Johnson & Johnson can provide feedback to potential candidates on the interviewing timeframe and timely information whether the potential candidate is no longer considered for the position.
"Johnson & Johnson can improve upon its follow-up regarding the application process.  This communication email  requesting me to complete a survey is the first acknowledgement I've received of my application.  If someone isn't a viable candidate, it would be appreciated to send them a rejection letter so they will be appraised of their application status instead of leaving them in limbo. 

Thank you."
Johnson & Johnson can improve the time  to response to the applicants.
Johnson & Johnson can improve the recruitment process by making the available opportunities more visible to the potential job seekers
"Johnson & Johnson can improve on its application feedback time. Also, Johnson & Johnson can give more opportunities to recent graduate with little years of pharmaceutical experience. Sometimes, lots of years of experience does not usually equal to increased job productivity and overall performance. "
Johnson & Johnson can better improve the recruitment process by reaching out to college campuses and hold seminars to reel young engineers to the company.  
"Johnson & Johnson can better communicate an applicant's standing within the recruitment process.  Given J&J high standards both as an employer and producer of high quality products, I had higher expectations in its ability to inform qualified individuals on the status of their application during the screening process."
Johnson & Johnson as a company already prove their self in the world market .   
"Johnson & Johnson application was clear, smoothly and took me not too long to finish. But I believe there is always a room for improvement, so I would suggest to the company adding a question to the candidate: 
Why are you applying for this specific position?
The answers may surprise the recruiters, and help to find a good fit. "
"Johnson & Johnson !!!

Good will is an intangible invisible asset of the company. J & J  always acknowledge the fact that employees are the real asset of the company.   Through this  survey you would be able to improve the recruit process.

Johnson & Johnson  can improve the recruitment process by showcasing a progression bar of your resume.I your resume was read and the final decision that was made
Johnson & Jhonson will make oppertunity for candidates in or outside from the company especially for the outsiders.
jobs posted seems to be wired for the most part based observations.  
Job seminars
Job recruitment events would be beneficial to both J&J and job seekers.  In-person meetings allow for a more accurate assessment of potential employees and work environment. 
Job postings should be listed for shorter time periods. 
Job posting should be concise with key elements and requirements listed. The existing posting is a little bit too long.
"Job descriptions are often worded for ""insiders"" to a given business or function, which makes them less accessible to talent in other businesses or functions.  Skills and experience often translate from one area to another, but indecipherable job descriptions stifle ""cross-pollination"" and the fostering of diversity."
"Job description with a line that says if an international person can apply for the position, or if J&J is sponsors visa"
Job Dashboard - if there is one I can't find it.  No where am I able to see the status of my application
"Job Attraction for me was key. Johnson & Johnson must attract individuals for a specific job. Whether they are the right fit or not, if the attraction is there some may take the leap and its up to J & J to see if the fit.






"
Job alerts sent out to job seekers should be specific to the keyword initial indicated on sign up 
Job Alerts
job advertisement needs to be in local news paper.
"JNJ should keep job listings more current by removing position that have been filled, there are many listings over 45 days old"
"JNJ seems to have an aversion within their HR group including Kelly services to older more experienced American Non-green card candidates. Despite my excellence in pharmaceuticals for over 25 years JNJ systematically disallows me to interview because of prejudice against age by your junior level , immmatrue managers and directors who are guided by their personal bias and the corporation allows such bias to be constant at Ethicon, Janssen and McNeil consumer where I have worked. 

It seems obvious to me if I were to change my name to amahad or gupta your HR idiots would quickly want to interview the same CV because of your bean counter policy to hire cheaper foreign labor because these people are more desperate and will accept lower wages and longer hours meanwhile you have regulatory compliance problems that are inherent in Ethicon, Janssen, and MCneil consumer I know I have seen the degree of non-compliance . your HR policy is one based on unethical practices run by people who are never audited by QA because there is no QA in HR only EEOC violation policies and practices bent on cheap labor over true experience and accomplished candidates like myself. Yes your practices are reportable as violations of several regulations and the FDA should become aware but you have probably paid them off to look the other way. I do not trust JNJ companies because over 7 years of work with various JNJ companies has proven to me you are incredibly stupid in the HR arena and your managers who hire are bent on preventing older workers mostly Americans from being hired and your Spanish and Indian managers prefer their own countrymen over Americans. You have a very poor process of hiring based on experience and talent because I believe you do not truly care about quality only high output and higher profits a policy the Boards of Directors and CEOs stand firmly by for the last 7 years at least"
JnJ recruitment process is excellent the way it is now. The only thing I can advise is too keep up the good work by doing what the company is doing.
"JNJ is missing opportunities to hire exceptional candidates, because they do not embrace people working remotely.  It would help them and their productivity to be more open to alternative working arrangements."
"JNJ invited me to apply, having my resume at hand and knowing the requirements for the role, just to reject the application within hours. Sounds like at least some waste of time."
JNJ could send an e-mail (like some other organizations) when the selection process has been completed.
JJ could be a little more prompt when informing the interviewee if he or she was chosen or not.  
"Je comprend très bien le RH...ma conjointe est DRH pour 16000 employés...et elle fait en sorte que les candidats ne soient pas des numéros...pcq...par définition les RH, sa s'occupe des humains.
Souerz plus humaniste....serait ma suggestion."
"JD's are usually quite dry and have many requirements both technical and personal skills
It is not always clear the nature of the questions within the application process: if sponsorship is not an option that should be clear in the JD, having question about requiring sponsorship some through as a gate, when the answer is YES it will discourage continuing with the application; some terms have a wide meaning (e.g. commercial experience, customer, consultancy). It would help if the requirements were explained instead of using buzz words
Feedback is quite limited. As an internal employee one gets the same automatic replay as an external applicant. Of course one can ask who is the hiring manager and then ask for feedback. My guess is that there is a known reason for rejecting an application, it would be great if this reason is place in the automatic replay so the candidate gets better feedback and can improve his/her applications or job search"
J&J's talent acquisition partners could get back to few application instead of machine working for them all the time. 
J&J's online recruitment process is one of the intuitive and easiest ones that I have experienced recently. The application process was simple and easy to complete.
J&J will benefit from the recruiter contacting the applicant and phone screening to help determine whether or not the applicant meets the job criteria.  
J&J was excellent in responding with affirmative action. 
"J&J treats all the candidates with respect evident by this survey. However, it would be better if the company could keep in touch more quickly about the status of a candidate's application. I had an interview earlier last year in September for a Medical Devices Sales role. The interview was very comfortable and professional. I emailed about my application status 2 weeks later to learn that it was still in process. I emailed again a month later and haven't heard since and was disappointed with the lack of communication."
"J&J should use the Google Scholars to access candidates citation reports and check their recognition on the field at ""Thomson Reuters InCites Essential Science Indicators (ESI) Thresholds"". Thomson Reuters ESI Threshold reveals the top 1% scientists in the world (by field of expertise), and this tools would help trim less qualified candidates applying for important positions at J&J."
J&J should reply to the candidates even if they are not selected.
"J&J should consider the applicants with similar back ground or expertise with the job posting. I am eappliedxpertised in state of the art technology LC-MS, LC-MS/MS, UPLC, HPLC and analytical techniques. With more than 10yrs of research experience I applied for couple of positions at J&J, unfortunately my cv was not even considered, it's frustrating to think that what is the value for talent and hard work.  Recently  my first author paper got accepted to Cell Metabolism,  one can imagine how much talent and hard work has contributed to get such high rates journal. Please consider people with talent not with references.
Thanks for giving me opportunity to share my thoughts 
Sincerely 
Sai"
J&J representatives should try to correspond to applicants more quickly.
"J&J needs to consider experienced senior employees who have had successful careers but still want to work. The mentorship skill set is a powerful tool, especially for younger employees. While employees compete for promotion and increased pay, senior employees get excited about contributing and, just as in coaching, there is a passion in seeing your mentee succeed.  

From a compensation perspective, senior employees don't need many of the full time benefits of younger employees and because most will have social security and pensions, they will accept less pay.   This is a great way to increase your experience, leadership and impact one of the greatest expenses.....people.

As a former CEO, we hired a number of these individuals and got a high level of experience and a great deal of senior leadership at a bargain price. 40% of our team were 79+ and above.  There is a wealth of talent out there.  You just have to open and not age be a factor.  "
J&J needs to actually speak to candidates more.
J&J is the leader that sets the standard for many other Pharma companies to follow. I will be looking forward for future opportunities. 
"J&J is the first company that I receive an email from to survey their recruiting process. I always regarded the company but with this plus, I am speechless! I hope that the application process doesn't only rely on automatic machine screening of the application and Resume but also includes human expert complete reading so the rating of the candidate comes holistic. Thank You!  Michel Ghosn - Candidate for IT Portfolio Manager"
"J&J is sending survey to ask what was my experience applying, but neveer gives feedback about my application, relevance to the position, or call back.
The application process is good enough but your feedback process can be improved."
"J&J is pretty standard as far as a website and process goes.  The quick response if one is considered or not is always beneficial, and appreciated.

"
"J&J is no different than any other employer in the market. It does not differentiate itself from any other company in regards to the recruitment or application process. 

Frankly, this survey is the only differentiating factor that makes me think any different about the company I had hoped would actually give a successful veteran a second look. Nope. Not even the standard ""we are looking for candidates that better fit our profile"" nonsense. "
"J&J is my dream place yo work, but out of all applications with J&J, I do feel that the final decision is not fair.
"
J&J is best in class. The new system is very user friendly. 
J&J has done everything correctly regarding the digital application process. I'm looking forward to hearing from someone on determining next steps as my skill set matches the qualifications for this role.
"J&J has done an outstanding job with their current recruitment process, no suggestions at this time."
"J&J has a great online application process, whereby I could easily submit my application and edit/check progress.  I look forward to hearing back from a member of HR or Legal as to next steps."
"J&J get the value of Resume database for unsuccessful candidate  from prior application,  and if these resume not suitable again for the vacant position, then J&J to advertise for the position. where this gives the credit and trust that J&J care for the people even they were unsuccessful before. "
"J&J fit into the current trend of employers looking for employees. The issue is that if a candidate is NOT moving to the next stage, there is no feedback or method of the potential employee know why they were not chosen. It is understandable that even minor feedback would take valuable time, but it would also show potential future employees that the company does actually care. It is hard to know if another position comes up, if the time should be taken to go through the process, or if the time is wasted because the ""fit"" does not work for the employers culture (or for any other reason). I still believe that J&J is a company with a positive reputation. Regards, Fred Boyd"
J&J does an excellent job recruiting. Bring in more Drexel alumni into the recruitment process because an alumni can easily connect with the student.  
J&J does an excellent job of recruiting professionals to honor their credo.
"J&J does a great job. Recently, I was not chosen for a position with J&J and I was happy to receive an email informing me of that decision. The communication I have received from other companies has been awful in comparison to J&J. Keep doing what you are doing."
"J&J does a good job with their job descriptions and application process.  After applying the candidate is left in the dark.  It would be helpful to send automatic updates to candidates such as:

1.  Position has closed from accepting submissions
2.  Your application has moved on to the review process
3.  Your application has moved onto the 2nd stage of review or you are no longer considered for the position.

Candidates often do not know where they are at and lose hope/interest in the position if their is a long lag time from submission to communication.
Thank you for asking me to participate in this survey"
"J&J did not get back to me with any response , a request for an interview or even to let me know the position was filled. Therefore there was NO recruitment process to speak of and J&J has a LOT of room for improvement. 
I would not call this a recruitment process again. I canned thank you letter would have been an improvement over your non-existent process,

I used to view you favorably but not any longer. Don't post a position if you don't intend to respond"
J&J could provide better and more frequent communication around my candidacy for the position. 
"J&J could make contact with me to discuss the role....? Kidding. 

For me the most important part of the process to continue with is the continues improvement segment. Honestly I was impressed.

All the best - now make contact with me :) I wasn't kidding that time haha "
"J&J could improve the recruitment process in two areas:

(1)  J&J often read like they are written primarily with internal applicants as the audience.  They often use a lot of acronyms in the job descriptions or make assumptions that candidates will understand the organizational structure of the position.  This makes it difficult to assess the fit.

(2)  J&J postings don't suggest any time period for the process.  The application process is straight-forward, but job postings will linger for months without closing and progressing to the next step.  

Johnson & Johnson can favorably attract strong external talent with a good recruiting process.  It can be a corporate advantage with some slight improvements in the process.  Thanks for asking.
"
"J&J could get back with a potential candidate if they are not in consideration.  Actually,  most organizations could do a better job of that.  "
J&J could contact each applicant.  You only get so much from a resume.  You will find out a whole lot more from speaking with someone.
"J&J could close the loop at the end of the recruiting process by sending an email when the opportunity does not materialize.  I got one of these types of replies, and it certainly helps to move on. I believe that the recruitment process does not end with the final ""submit"" of the application.  

I think the process to apply is streamlined and intuitive.  "
J&J could call the candidate to schedule an interview.
J&J can utilize the experience of the colleagues (who have previously worked at J&J in temporary or permanent positions) because they are likely to be more impactful and efficient right at the outset due their familiarity with the J&J processes and products compared to colleagues who never worked at J&J. 
"J&J application process is good, but there is never any follow-up or closure from J&J - NEVER HEAR ANYTHING.  I applied for a few positions and never hear anything.  Even the recruiters are confused and complain - jobs are posted, then withdrawn, then posted as temp, then changed.  No one knows what jobs are real and which ones are not - worst follow-up of any place I ever applied to."
J and J can provide feedback why an applicant was not selected during the recruitment process and what he should develop in order to be selected for such a position in future.
J & J needs to remove postings when managers have already made hiring decisions. I applied for this position and the manager had already made a decision before the final interview process had been completed.  
"J & J is missing communication process. Till today after 1 month of application, didn't hear back from J&J. I don't even know whether the position is still open or closed. It should have been a good idea to send an email about the result"
"J & J is in a right direction to acquire the talents any where in the world, they recruits people based on the merits, i am happy about it. "
"J & J is a world renowned brand name and does not need publicity as such, but i believe that publishing the vacancies at multiple platforms would help to grab the right candidate for the job and competitive level would be more."
"J & J is a great company and looking forward to joining the talented team.  

I applied for few positions at J&J, and finally for one position Talent Acquisition Manager contacted me and  spoke to me about the job, and took some information.  He mentioned that either the team or he will contact me on the next steps. However, I haven't heard back from him or the team.  

Would appreciate if your talent acquisition managers could inform the candidates where they are in terms of recruiting, even if they were not selected.

"J & J has very simple and straightforward initial application process, gave me feeling that my time is respected by the company even I’m just an applicant. I appreciate that. "
its wonderful 
"Its really excellent , I want carrier Apps from Johnson& Johnson"
Its pretty general but a quick LinkdIn apply may be helpful and easy.
Its perfect
"Its ok for me, very easy and as an inicial preview is enough information "
"Its not a matter of improving. Its matter of keeping your current process simple as I experienced. The managers I interviewed with on the phone initially and in person ultimately kept to their word on timing of followup, status report, next steps, what to expect next. Their efforts made my process easy and helped me see in retrospect elements of the J&J Credo in action. I had another offer but went with J&J because of how the impression my interviewers made on me. "
its good no improvements needed
"Its difficult because you hear from a lot of applicants, so i understand. In a perfect world it is great to hear from a live person but not sure if it is even possible. "
Its close to impossible to get even a call from a J&J recruiter. It seems like you hire from within or there is candidate who has been already ear marked with no consideration from the outside.
"Its challenging to vet candidates via electronic submission, as the interpersonal side is absent, removing one of the most critical criteria of personal assessment.  Enhancing the capabilities for candidates to showcase themselves, in a more rounded way would be helpful - emphasizing skill level, ethics, competencies, ""presence"", etc.. would be helpful.

Having hired many people, the ability to assess the interpersonal side of a candidate has resulted in my most successful hires.

Thanks for allowing me to offer my thoughts.



"
its already fair
Its a joke seriously no call backs; hiring managers hire people internal and just use an external candidate to satisfy looking for at least one or two external. Its a joke
Its a good procedure no need for any udation. Thanks johnson & johnson 
"It's very impersonal, I never heard from J&J after the initial email acknowledging you received my application.  Then I'm being asked to provide my feedback on the process, however the survey has nothing to do with the recruitment process.  J&J is great.  Applying for a job with J&J sucks and reflects extremely poorly on the company.  J&J Recruitment does not follow the J&J Credo."
"It's really sad that a degree was required for the job when no one goes to college to be a recruiter. I met all of the requirements + more and rank in the Top 2% in my field, yet because I don't have a degree, I was rejected. A degree doesn't determine someone's drive or dedication. It doesn't even predict performance. You're losing out on great talent because you require a degree for jobs that don't need one. "
It's pretty user friendly as is...thanks!
It's pretty straightforward and simple. 
It's pretty good to me.
"It's only been a few days since I submitted my application so I haven't heard anything yet, other than receiving this survey, so I don't have much insight at this point.  I don't know if J&J notifies all applicants if they have not received a position or even when the position has been filled, which is nice for the job applicant.  Thank you for reaching out for feedback.  "
It's one of the best! 
It's nothing really to improve as the job description mention everything in detail
"It's not just Johnson & Johnson, but in general, applicants typically feel a sense of wondering after submitting an application.  Knowing where an application is in the process is always good to know to understand if it was already reviewed, under consideration, and the company decided it was not a good fit / had better candidates."
"It's not improving the recruitment online process.  It's selecting a candidate with the skills and experience for a position that they submitted for.  I've been rejected multiple times and I have the skills to be a key team member for J&J.   True, I don't have a degree.... but I have hands-on real life experience and worked in challenging environments to be successful working together with the team and sharing my knowledge and expertise.
Otherwise, I will continue to submit for opportunities with J&J.  It's a milestone and a dream that I must accomplish to be an employee working for J&J.

"It's not as fast and easy as it should be.  So many company's with jobs posted on LinkedIn use their Easy Apply option --- this is FAR preferable to the Apply On Company Website option.  And not necessarily because J&J has a bad process, but because SO many other companies' do!  It can be mind numbing to complete these multi-page company forms...  J&J's initial presentation to a job seeker is influenced by this poor process perception.  

You have the skills to parse info out of a LinkedIn profile and resume.  I'd suggest you use it and then invite good applicants to a second level of detailed, or position specific, info submittal if you need to."
"It's nice that after I upload my CV I don't have to repopulate a whole bunch of info boxes that the software failed to correctly extract.  This is the case for most of the other big pharma career portals and honestly, it's so frustrating that it's almost prohibitive for me to apply for their jobs.  Kudos!"
"It's interesting that you would have someone complete a survey even though they were informed that a group of candidates that more closely meets the needs of the business were identified and will not be pursuing your candidacy for this position.

In fact you have sent multiple messages in this regard.  Please rethink this practice.  While the survey beneficial to you it is not to the person who was disqualified. "
It's insulting that you found time to inquire about my application process considering you never responded to my application submission. 
It's great.
It's great.
It's good 
It's good
It's fine as is.
"It's been very disappointing that after years of applying for roles at J&J, I have only received a phone interview once. 
I have had better experience with J&Js competitors. "
It's been over a week now when I applied but haven't heard anything back yet.
It's been over a month and the only communications I have received about the position was an email stating I applied and this survey. Having update communication on were applications stand would be a plus.
"It's been over 3 weeks since I applied for the JLABS Administrative Coordinator position, and I have yet to receive any feedback, or what the status is."
It's been almost a month and I haven't had any feedback on the hiring process for this role.
It's been a month since I've submitted my application. Could I please get an update? Thank you.
"It's always my hope that the company take into account the true value and quality experience that an applicant has. Lately, I'm not so sure that's a reflection of what I see in the field. In order to for physicians and other medical professionals to see our value...hire value."
It's always helpful to have timely information as to where your candidacy is in the recruitment process. 
It's already streamlined.
It's all good !
It's a black hole - like every other online submission portal.  I really miss the personal connection.  What's happening is highly qualified candidates are just avoiding opportunities.  
"It's a bit strange to receive this survey since I never heard back from J&J after submitting the job application nearly a month ago.  So my primary feedback would be to at least respond back to applicants if J&J is interested or not.

Have a nice day..."
It'd be nice to hear where you are with the process of hiring and update on consideration of application.
"It would please me greatly for you recruitment process to end in an interview. In all seriousness, your website it user friendly. It is a little difficult to find the login area for people who  have created an account with you at times that is not always present on the page."
It would help to have responses made to candidates.
"It would have helped greatly to have the promoted products listed on the job posting.  When I went onto the company website to look up the products they weren't listed by disease, so I had to click through each product to figure it out.  Also, I had a horrible time with the technical side.  I keep getting locked out of my account and have had to contact IT 4-5 times."
It would have been nice to have heard either way about whether I got at least an interview or phone call before I received a survey. 
"It would have been nice to have heard back from someone even if I wasn't going to be offered an interview.  But all in all, a simple and intuitive process.  "
"It would have been helpful to hear that I was not considered for the job, as I waited to hear.
Thank you"
It would have been helpful to have a recruiter to reach out to with questions. I applied to this position after it had been posted a while and I believe it was likely already filled by the time I applied. I spent a great deal of time working on my application and was disheartened at the thought that I applied to an outdated job posting.
"It would have been helpful to have a clearer understanding of the timeline of next steps after the submission of my resume - i.e. who would reach out to confirm receipt of my resume, an estimated timeframe for receiving notification of either an invitation to interview or a decline of my application, etc.  "
"It would have been helpful to be able to upload a cover letter rather than typing it in or copying and pasting, which loses the format items, which can be helpful both for clarity and emphasis."
It would have been great to been given feedback as to the rationale taken to decide as to why I was not the most suitable candidate for this position.
It would have been great to be able to have had a short question/answer section where I could explain why this specific job was important to me. There is only so much you can fit into a cover letter and I would have loved to explain why I'm so passionate about the clinical aspects of this job. 
"it would been nice to receive a personal phone call from recruiter to review the job /opening .
also with my resume the skills your are for was a match.
the job posted was in my eyes there was missing from the post since I did not get at lease phone interview .

please feel free contact me  if you have any questions.

"It would be very helpful to post the status of the candidate's application.  Additionally, I tried updating my profile due to a more recent update to my profile, but the types of attachments allowed are very limited to just the resume and cover letter.  It's probably worth looking into providing a way to attach ""Other"" types of attachments, e.g. certificates, recommendations, etc."
It would be very helpful if J&J would get back to the candidates in a more timely fashion regarding their application for the open position.
"It would be very good if you consider to add an open question to ask the applicants if they want to add important data that can change the decision based on the filters of the questions above. For example, the question ""Do you have a valid job permision?"" doesn´t let us explain in which part of the process we are, considering that the filters won´t consider you as an eligible option for the job posting."
"It would be valuable to automatically send a timeline regarding when to expect the next communication. I'm familiar with the longer recruitment timelines common with large enterprises, due to waiting for the posting process to close and then going through a screening process.  However, communicating a timeline/estimate for the next contact can be helpful to younger recruits to keep them from getting discouraged and potentially choosing a lesser opportunity. For example, a line in the initial email following application might say, 'We will be in touch with you within 4 weeks via email or phone's ( if 4 weeks happened to be the timeline)."
It would be truly helpful to follow up with applicants if they passed initial screening or not.
It would be the perfect process if it would provide me with an opportunity of a face to face interview so I can discuss and convince the hiring manager I have the skills and the energy to be successful in this role. :-)
"It would be really nice if recruiters reached out. I have met with a recruiter before at a head hunter's event, and was a great fit with experience. It is quite interesting that within a hour of applying I receive a rejection letter; as if my name is linked to the automatic rejection pile. I attended a university that Johnson & Johnson heavily recruits from, and have heard the same things from others. "
It would be really goos to indicate why a certain resume was rejected
"It would be of value for applicants with which J&J does not pursue the process to provide feedback about why the applicant does not progress. E.g. in my case, I was confident I am a very interesting candidate for the role I applied to, and it would be of value to me to understand why the hiring team has a different opinion about this.

I have requested through separate communication to receive this feedback, without any response from J&J.

I belief that implementing a meaningful and honest feedback process would further distinguish J&J as a reputable company.

Thank you
Ger Kamminga"
"It would be of great benefit to the applicants if HR can respond to emails (when requested for updates) and if possible, provide feedback to applicants on why their candidacy wasn't pursued. This will enable candidates to be better prepared in the future. "
It would be nice to speak with a person if there were questions
It would be nice to see where my application is in the process. Has it been received? Has it been looked at? etc.
"It would be nice to see an careers page that the applicant can log into to see what they have applied to and when. Also, hearing back if you are not selected. "
"It would be nice to see a time line of your interviewing/hiring process. Knowing, for example,  that it would be 1-2 weeks before talking to a live person.....ect. "
"It would be nice to receive an active (email) update where my application is at in the process. Currently it feels a bit like a black box. I would like to know: is my request recieved, did you take a look at it yet, do you need more information, is it handled by US or (in my case more suitable) by the Netherlands, etc."
It would be nice to receive a response in the progression of the process.
It would be nice to receive a message-even an automated one-if you are no longer being considered for the position.
"It would be nice to provide updates as to the status of the job.  Have interviews been set up?  Are reviews of resumes still in process?  The position has been closed and interviews are being set up, etc."
It would be nice to know why I was not selected for an interview although I understand you receive a large number of applications and this may not be feasible. 
It would be nice to know where you are and what stage the hiring manager is in the process.  So far I have had two interviews for this position.  I haven't heard anything else.
"It would be nice to know the level of expertise needed for the position before delving into the details of the position description. Otherwise, the application process was relatively straightforward."
It would be nice to know quickly whether Johnson & Johnson is seriously considering me for the role.
It would be nice to know approximate dates or timeline for the decision process. There is no way to contact the interviewer to check application status. Email notifications can take 5 - 6 months. 
It would be nice to hear sooner if the position has been filled or if they plan on moving forward with your application.
It would be nice to hear something back sooner. I applied for this job around 3 months ago. However I am still very interested in working at Johnson & Johnson. I hear it is a great company to be a part of. 
It would be nice to hear something back on the application that I submitted.  It took a lot of time to prepare and it's only professional to reply back with some type of feedback be it positive or negative.
"It would be nice to hear some communication back from a HR or talent acquisition representative sooner than they do now. I have had no communication besides the computerized acknowledgement of receipt for my application and this survey, about 3 weeks after I submitted my application."
It would be nice to hear from someone from the talent acquisition team within a reasonable timeframe regarding the application. 
"It would be nice to hear an official ""no"" if not selected for a position. 

It looks like you revamped the application process over the last few years. It is definitely much easier to navigate now. "
"It would be nice to have some quick feedback about if and when an applicant might be contacted about the position, and whether the company is interested in  near-term follow-up with the applicant. That would let applicants make decisions about whether to apply for other positions in the short-term or wait to gauge J&J's interest before doing so."
It would be nice to have intermittent follow up on if one is still being considered for the position applied for or not.  
It would be nice to have a personal feedback on the application no matter whether the feedback is positive or not.
It would be nice to have a follow-up message that you are no longer being considered for a position.
It would be nice to have a better understanding of the recruitment process. 
"It would be nice to get periodic status as the application moves, or doesn't move through the process. This is the first time I have applied to the company, so I have no idea how long the process takes or what Johnson & Johnson does as a standard practice. Status and even a rejection letter or email would be good to have if that is not currently part of the process."
It would be nice to get feedback on whether the application/ resume was viewed and if it was a good fit or not for the job posting 
It would be nice to get an answer of the status of my application before being ask to take a survey. 
It would be nice to get a response from HR regarding my application. 
It would be nice to be kept in the loop more.  The automated email was nice saying that I applied but I haven't heard anything back (good or bad) until this survey.  Thank you.
"It would be nice to be able to have a window into whether the application I have submitted for review for a given position is being considered, has been passed on, etc. "
"It would be nice to be able to check and see where you are in the application process.  For example, if your resume has been reviewed yet or if you were rejected."
It would be nice Roger a response back a little quicker even if you are not being considered for a position.
It would be nice if you could write a short cover letter rather than having to upload an existing one.
It would be nice if they could give faster a response to the application.
"It would be nice if they can send a letter of rejection or interest in a timely manner.  

Thank you."
"It would be nice if the recruiter assigned to the job could reach out to the applicant once the job application has been submitted.  

Second, a status update would be very helpful. Also, once the application is submitted there is virtually no communication regarding the job status, i.e. if the organization/department will be interviewing soon or if there already is an applicant selected. "
It would be nice if the company phone screened qualified individuals first and gave them a chance instead of just glancing at a resume and deciding the person didn't deserve a shot.
"It would be nice if I could track the status of my application/s online. I have seen some places provide a one line per application summary: the job title, a link to the job description, when I applied, and if the application was received/in process/not selected/closed/referred/etc. This is incredibly helpful.

Also-- I know it's a challenge a lot of companies face-- but finding a way to actually get the right people in front of the right people would be amazing. If getting through to the right person at a company was easier and the application process could filter out applicants by whatever predetermined requirements, then you'll hopefully get more relevant and quality applicants, and we hopefully don't have to send out so many applications (can be very time-consuming and often not even seen by a person)."
It would be nice contact people who have applied to tell them whether they are or are not being considered for the positions after the auto-receipt is sent. 
It would be ideal to have a tool to track the status of the application. Thanks
It would be ideal to get feedback about the hiring decision before being issued a survey like this!
It would be helpful to receive some updates about the application status
"It would be helpful to receive an update on the status of the application, whether the news is positive or negative."
"It would be helpful to receive a point of contact for follow ups, after applying to an online position."
It would be helpful to receive a call or at least an email letting the applicant know when they should expect to hear from J & J. 
It would be helpful to provide potential job candidates with a flow diagram of what they might expect during the application process. This could be made available on the 'Careers' section of the Johnson & Johnson website. Thank you for asking my opinion!
It would be helpful to know your application status before being asked to complete surveys about the recruitment process.
"It would be helpful to know if I am in consideration for the role. Likewise, the reason behind not being selected for further advancement would be helpful to future searches. 
I know that I am the kind of contributor that your company would value. I hope to be able to contribute in the future! Regards, Laurl Matey MSN RN CHPN"
It would be helpful to keep the applicant notified if the position has been filled. 
It would be helpful to have clear understanding of the timeline and interviewing process in order to manage expectations.
"It would be helpful to have better visibility on current status on where an applicant is in the recruitment process. A sliding bar/timeline mechanism to inform applicants when their documents have been reviewed, or when they are being scheduled for an interview would allow them to breathe easier knowing what is going on behind the scenes."
"It would be helpful to have any feedback. Currently I have no status on my application, if it was reviewed, if it is currently held in consideration for a specific position, or it has been marked for no further review."
"It would be helpful to have an understanding of the timeframe which the position will be filled. Also, I have multiple years of pharmaceutical experience, my MBA, and a strong drive to excel. It is hard to believe I have not even been called for an interview and the process makes it very impersonal..."
"It would be helpful to have an easier way to search for jobs.  The drop down menus are not easy to navigate.  I knew that the position posted, yet could not find it.  I even tried to use just the amount of days posted, and never found my listing.  I had to have it sent to me."
"It would be helpful to have a way to track the status of my application submission, or receive a status update."
It would be helpful to get information on the status of the opportunity and if I was a good fit.
"It would be helpful to get feedback on why we are not selected for a position instead of just a blanket automatic response. While this may not be feasible with hundreds of applicants, I think it would provide applicants with an understanding of what they can do to improve. It also would show applicants that J&J cares for them. I appreciate the opportunity to provide this feedback. Thank you."
It would be helpful to get an email update of the status of the application process. Other than that it's been great! 
It would be helpful to be able to access an updated dashboard on recruitment process.
It would be helpful if you would inform a potential candidate in a timely manner how long the process will take.  It can be months and you will not hear from the recruiter.
It would be helpful if there were brief descriptions of some of the major roles formatted as short videos by individuals currently working with the company in that capacity.
"It would be helpful if the recruiter were to provide an email or phone call to say why the candidate was not a good fight for the position. I realize that is hard if there are may applicants. I just feel there is a missing step in the recruitment process. You apply and either you get contacted or you don't. I feel an imporvement would be to provide some guidance as to why or what the applicant could do to improve.
 
It would have been very helpful for me to know why I wasnt a good fit. I want to better myself for the company and I would be interested to know what they feel I am lacking so I can target my development."
it would be helpful if the recruiter provided timely feedback regarding the different phases of the interview process.
"It would be helpful if on review of a candidate that did not get accepted to provide some kind of reason for the rejection.  If it was an automated rejection ,  then maybe something was not filled in correctly."
It would be helpful if Johnson & Johnson processed the application faster in response. 
It would be helpful if Johnson & Johnson contacted candidates after one week or so letting them know if they were under consideration or not. 
It would be helpful if J&J can provide a status update on the progress of an application. Thanks.
"It would be helpful if candidates received some sort of status, instead of no updates."
It would be helpful for a notification when the position has been filled. 
"It would be great to submit a video to the recruiting team so I can showcase my accomplishments and value proposition, which would show that I am a worthy candidate and good fit for Johnson & Johnson."
"It would be great to see a status of where you are at in the recruitment process.

Best Regards

Anthony Jones"
It would be great to receive some response back ether way of the outcome.
It would be great to receive a phone call to that both parties can get to know each other and understand the future of the company and if there is a good fit.
It would be great to know why someone wasn't a good fit either by qualifications or the area they live in. I'm a former J & J employee and know that I'm qualified but have not had luck in the re-hire process. 
It would be great to hear updates in emails on my application status 
"It would be great to hear a response to a resume submission, even it's an automated ""no""."
It would be great to have more timely feedback on decisions and the process. With today's talent acquisition systems this can be easily automated i/o being a black hole.
It would be great to have more positions available in the Greater Toronto Area!
It would be great to have better transparency on the process and timelines. I applied a week and a half ago and am waiting to hear back on one out of the two roles I applied to.
It would be great to get a response to the online application.  
It would be great to communicate to the candidate where they stand in the process. If their application is considered for employment or not. 
It would be great if you could send a courtesy letter to acknowledge and confirm the receipt of application. I haven’t received any!
"It would be great if there was an automated process to keep you in the loop.
1. Application Received
2. Application has been reviewed 
   2a.  Application was moved forward  or rejected
   2b.  If application was rejected why
3. Application is moving to HR Recruiter
   3a.  letting the applicant know of this process (Moving forward / denial).
4. Application moving to Round 1 
 4a. cycle through those until however many rounds need to be conducted.

I believe too often candidates are not kept in the loop and it's greatly appreciated by most to be kept in the loop of the status regardless of the outcome.  That way candidates are not waiting around or hoping that they may get something out of the job that will not happen.

Thanks for your time,
Mike

"It would be great if the recruiting process did not take 2-3 months and this time period was shortened, especially where severed employees are concerned."
"It would be great if the questions related to current base salary is an optional, as this is confidential information. My overall experience with the online application process was great when compared to other companies that I applied recently and in the past."
It would be great if Johnson & Johnson gives feedback to end of process specially the candidate does not pass the process.  Thanks.
It would be great if J&J would send a feedback to the candidates about the status of the application.  Applicants always are grateful from companies that gives a feedback even if they are not longer a candidate for the applied position.
"It would be great if I was given the job!

Or at least told if I am being passed over. "
"It would be great if I could have more transparency within the process in terms of navigating if there is an interest– did my resume get reviewed? How long does the process take? Do you like me but feel this is not the right role? 

I don't like the lack of feedback while I keep waiting.I usually don't hear anything until the role is filled, which is very long. If there is a role I really want, this is frustrating.
Can you have a visual navigation to show where you are in the process?"
It would be great if a recruiter would contact me to discuss my qualifications and to help me to apply to a position where the hiring manager would seriously consider me.
It would be good to receive feedback on whats missing or what else is needed to be considered to positions like the one I applied to.
It would be good to provide more frequent updates regarding where the position is in the process. 
It would be good to get more timely feedback on whether you are a fit for the role. I applied for a position two months ago and never heard back. 
It would be good to get a response. I have not received neither an approval nor a rejection email even months after application.
It would be good hear back on my application. Have not gotten any response so far.
"It would be fantastic to understand where an application is in the review process - under review, reviewed, sent to hiring manager, or if the applicant was not selected to move forward in the process. This would provide a very helpful level of transparency for the applicant as they work hard to find a career match."
"It would be fantastic if I could get a phone interview with a recruiter. I have been trying to link in with different J & J employees on LinkedIN, but unfortunately have not yet made any connections to help get my resume in. I feel the system is very automated, and am not really sure anyone is really looking at resumes. It would be great to have a more personal touch, and have a live conversation with someone in talent acquisition."

It would be easier if we could search for jobs based on the years of experience required or the degree level required.
"It would be better to get response regarding my application for the position, one way or the other, before sending out this survey."
It would be better if responsinh time is shorter after applying for position.
It would be beneficial to hear back in regards to the status of your application even if its not being considered for the position.
"It would be beneficial for the candidate and possibly helpful for your recruitment team/process to provide feedback/insight as to why the candidate was not selected to move further in the process.  Best Regards, Bill"
It would be benefial to be able to follow up via email or other on current application process and status of consideration for the role.
It would be appreciated to receive even an automated respose when an applicant is no longer being considered for a position. Many thanks for your consideration.
It would be appreciated if the applicant could see the status of his or her candidacy with more detail and in real time.
It would be advisable to have a faster job application response. I have applied for 3 positions and I still haven't heard of any response yet. 
"It would be a pertinent improvement if J&J takes on the responsibility of hiring the employees with the help of it's internal Human Resources Department, rather than relying on the recruiters. 
Recruiters and headhunters lack the ability to identify appropriate resources which will be a value add for the long run. Also due to subletting of the recruitment process, the third tier recruiters are not able to offer compensation which commensurate with the abilities of temp to hire resources, hence lack of presentation of appropriate resources. "
It would be a nice feature for the applicant to know their status in the process i.e. Received and reviewed.  If for any reason during the process the candidate is not a fit for the role a follow up email could indicate that and perhaps recommend other open roles that may be a better fit.  
"It would  be great to get a follow up call, letting its candidates know the status of their application."
It worked well. Hope to work for JnJ!!
It will take time for Johnson & Johnson but maximizing  the opportunities of  a Face to Face interview with applicant would be good understanding for each other.
"It will really help to communicate more regarding the role. I applied almost two months ago and still waiting to hear back. This happened in spite of the fact that an internal J&J employee referred me for this role.

Thanks."
"It will be three weeks since my interview,it would be good to get a update on my position with getting the job.
Thank you 
Tom Richardi"
"It will be really helpful if Johnson & Johnson can keep updating the status of the application online. This will help me as a candidate to know if the application has passed the HR or recruiting facility and moved to the hiring manager.
As a candidate, it becomes will be very helpful."
"It will be nice to have a face to face meeting with the current employees (recruiting event). 
Also, I wish there is a day for an open house for a prospective candidate to visit and see the company. "
It will be helpful to know what the application status is at least once in 2 -3 weeks. 
It will be greatly welcomed if Johnson & Johnson can reach out to applicants within the shortest possible period of time in connection with recruitment for further processing.
It will be great if J&J can share videos of their employee experience for future applicants along with the job ad. 
It will be better to have quick response time to each application. It's better to evaluate each applicant over phone.
It was very User friendly and a simple process.
"It was very streamlined and intuitive, which ended in a great application process. Looking forward to hearing from Johnson & Johnson for a career opportunity."
It was very streamlined and easy to complete.  I see no need to change anything.
"It was very strange to submit an application on US website with US orientated questions for a job location potentially in Europe. 
Additionnally it would have been interesting, instead of receiving an automated email to have an explanation why J&J will not proceed further with the candidature (when I was exactly matching the job description) . "
"It was very simple to fill in all the details. This form was easier than other sites, including Alcon, Abbott and other major companies.

It was very simple and the process was very efficient. No improvements would be needed. 
It was very seamless compared to other company's application process
It was very professional yet an easy process. No complaints!
"It was very intuitive. Having the information copied from LinkedIn saved quite a bit of time. Site is also mobile friendly, as I applied from my smartphone. I don't see any need for improvement at this time."
It was very easy.  No complaints 
It was very easy to navigate. 
It was very easy so far.
"It was very easy and straight forward, which is already excelling to the end point of its purpose. At the very moment no adjustments are necessary. "
It was very disappointing that my application was rejected immediately with no proper reason provided although I did have the vast majority of the qualifications. It would be nice to get a short reason (i.e. Did not meet requirements: Experience) so that the applicant can prepare better for the next time.
It was straight forward. I do not have any major complaints.
"It was straight forward and efficient.     

At this point I have not received a status of my application, perhaps updating applicants in a timely manner could be considered.  "
"It was slightly difficult to navigate the J&J website in order to sign into the career page. Other than that minor challenge, I was very pleased with the process. "
It was simple and straightforward. Nothing to change.
It was simple and direct. Went well
It was really straight forward this time. I've applied to J&J positions in the past though and have felt left in the dark. I wish that it was always this clear and easy!
It was quite seamless

It was pretty easy to maneuver. Easy to understand what was being asked in each section. 
It was pretty clear and straightforward
it was not easy to find out when the job was closing. I looked quickly but did not see it.
"It was great to receive prompt feedback on my application, however it gave me very little in the way of constructuve feedback. There was also no contact given to be able to ask questions about the role at any time both before and during my application."
"It was great experience applying to Johnson & Johnson and it was easy to understand next steps. To improve, recruitment process, company should look into application soon. "
It was easy to apply for available positions.
It was easy I never got a call at all for this position.  I have 18 years and also was a RN taking care of seriously infected patients with sepsis.  Always curious to why I get a call from most jobs I apply for but some nothing at all.  Is it Better to put a cover page?
It was by far the easiest to navigate and apply.  
It was an efficient way to upload a resume and fill out some general data.  It is by far the best application process I have encountered.
"It was an easy, quick process but it might be useful to see an update on the status in the dashboard regarding whether the applicant is being considered. "
It was an easy to process to apply for the open position which it made it that much easier to complete. 
It was an easy process. 
It was an easy process for me.  One recommendation for improvement that could be implemented is follow-up on the status of the application after submission.
It was an easy application process.
It was an easy and smooth process.
"It was an easy and clear application process, thank you for the opportunity to apply."
"It was acuare process, good to l Know about the job opportunity and the candidate skills to perform any tasks,"
"It was a very respectful, efficient  process. "
It was a very positive experience for me. The interviews were done professionally and gave me ample opportunity to discuss my experience and insights. The initial phone screen was a bit perfunctory and impersonal but everything subsequent to that has been outstanding.
"It was a very easy process... I would include to maintain constant communication with the candidate throughout the process.
Thanks."
It was a great recruitment process.
It was a great experience on all levels.
It was a bit lengthy but appropriate. 
"It typically takes months to get a rejection letter, if at all, and there is no feedback on why the candidate wasn't a fit. I would recommend for our internal candidates that some rationale be provided out of respect for their time/efforts. There is also the unspoken practice of posting positions that the hiring Managers already have someone slotted for. This creates frustration among our folks looking to increase their impact on the business and causes trepidation about applying to future internal positions. It introduces the idea of looking externally to J&J in order to have a better chance at landing an ideal role.  "
"It took some time to upload my resume to the site, in fact, it took so long that I tried all of your options.

I was able to upload my resume eventually, so not sure if my internet was slow or Johnson & Johnson's server.

Still I kept trying because I think your company has great potential."
"It takes too long to hear back. Positive or negative, the people applying are relying on feedback and it seldom times doesn't even happen at all. Please follow through with applicants."
It should move faster with its recruitment process. They didn't even take time to review my resume.
It should bring in people with the right set of mind to improve current product techniques and look into the future products that can save cost in the long term.
It should be based on the capability assessment and passion rather than the current profile. Candidates like me have acquired specialist skills to take on such roles.
It seems to me that the recruitment process is very good but we should all have room for improvement.
It seems to be working as it is set up now. I don't really have the ability to speak to the entire process as I was never contacted after the initial application submittal. 
It seems to be great
It seems to be fine.
"It seems the recruitment process has been pretty transparent so far, so keep it up. As an applicant, its nice to be regularly updated on progress of my application. "
It seems that I was never considered for the position. I never received a call from anyone or email. So I would at least let the candidate know your intentions on the candidate.
it seems that i apply for jobs that i have the skills and education for but sometimes dont even get a screening interview. i think you need to know someone to help introduce you to the hiring manager to have an opportunity for a position
"It seems that corporations may float a position when an internal or external candidate is already identified.  My understanding this is for process reasons.  However, this can cause others to put effort into submitting an application when it actually is to no avail.  It would be helpful if positions for which a candidate has been identified prior are not posted. This is particularly true for those of us external to the business."
It seems online applications end up in black box
"It seems like that a candidate was already selected for this position and it was just a formality to post this, because I was told right away that right candidate for interview has been identified."
"It seems like job descriptions are written to find a perfect candidate, which probably doesn't exist. There are probably several great candidates that self-eliminate because they feel like they don't fit the job description. My guess is that J&J (along with dozens of other employers) are missing out on the opportunity to hire great people who will exceed expectations by over-writing job descriptions."
"It seems impossible by todays standards, but I do wish the agenda was clear. If you are qualified you deserve at least a yes/no/get lost/never... It is not just J&J but several companies. You do all sorts of things- in my case KNOWING you are an ideal candidate-....and never hear anything back. "
"It seemed that I was entering the same information that was pulled form my resume at different places. If information could only be asked for once, the process would seem a bit smoother."
It needs a better field recognition software when processing the uploaded resume file
It might be nice to know when the job closes and when you might expect to hear back on status.  other than that it was a very simple process.   
It may be helpful to outline estimated response timing that candidates may be able to expect from creating an account or applying for a position
it looks perfect
"It is very much applicant friendly & quite clear on the role & requirement of the company.
I think it is very much perfect. "
"It is very impressive to be able to complete a survey regarding my application even before being contacted by a recruiter. It seems Johnson & Johnson is taking a proactive approach in the hiring process. I think Johnson & Johnson should continue with the same approach and be willing to contact applicants in any events, even though unexpected feedback is given by applicants.   "
It is very impersonal. It would be nice to get some feedback. It has no human interaction or way for the applicant to be notified on a skill set they are lacking etc. i
It is very hard for me to give the opinion as I was screened out at the very beginning. Still I've participated the survey.
It is very good and user friendly tool
"It is very difficult to get noticed with the current ""screening"" process.  It often requires potential job seekers to ""trick"" the system with certain key words/phrases.  This process eliminates VERY qualified candidates."
"It is understandable that a plethora of individuals apply to one position, however one thing that I would suggest needs improvement is getting back to candidates more quickly on the status of his/her application. "
"It is too early in the process for me to provide input, as I have applied but have not yet received an invitation for an interview."
it is the most user friendly 
It is the first time I apply for a position at your company and found the recruitment process (regarding the add and application) to be quite easy and direct or to the point. I had no problems applying for the position. 
It is the best processes I've ever seen thus far. 
It is taking long to get a response after you applied online.  
"It is surprising that i do not get a response about my application, but instead i receive only feedback surverys. The response time for sending a mail notifying whether you have been selected or not takes ages. I thought it was unacceptable, especially when you keep an applicant guessing. 
Final thought is that i don't see the recruitment keen on hiring people who are genuinely passionate to work for the company, atleast from my personal experience."
"It is rather clear that most if not almost all postings are not being filled.  I am not sure if you have preselected people and are required to post them to show ""outside people"" have filled out the applications first, but you should know J&J has a major reputation that it is a waist of time to apply.  I am qualified for many great looking posts for positions but it is useless to try.  I know many, many people who simply don't even bother to apply to any J&J positions.  To think I have 20 years with Pfizer, BMS and Daiichi Sankyo and lots of global experience and I too give up.  Do I think anyone at J&J will read this or care if they do, not in the least.  Good luck."
It is quite easy to navigate and seems like a good process so far. 
It is pretty standard and was not complicated. I am not in a position to speak beyond the application stage of the recruitment process. So there is that! heh
it is pretty good as is
It is perfect ! nothing else...
"It is not easy to understand the job application process, e.g., how edits/updates to application profile affects the submission, whether new information gets reviewed or not. All one gets is ""application has been submitted"" each time.

Also, I have not heard anything for 3 weeks, even though the position has been posted for more than 2 months."
"It is not always clear where in the application process a bid on a job is and if it is progressing.
Communication of receipt, decision to proceed etc would all be valuable "
It is nice that one does have to re enter resume info in other fields as with other application systems. The application process was clear and easy to use.
It is necessary to expediate the hiring process and respond to applicants in a timely fashion so not to bring up their hopes. 
It is intuitive
"It is in my personal view that my resume is not making it past HR to the hiring managers.  It is my view that J&J is not open to diversity of people with different industry backgrounds to join this industry.  There is no way that based on my experience and job history and the fact that I met every requirement listed for this job that I would not get a phone interview at least.  
that is my view. "
It is imperative to incorporate the traditional methods of recruitment done by the company's HR department with paid recruiters when searching for senior personnel.
It is highly important to receive the feedback upon CV submitted. In case you were not approved for the next level of interview it should be commented indicating the reasons.
"It is hard to suggest improvement without knowing anything about your currecnt process. However, as a candidate, I would like to  timely response. "
It is great web site to see all opportunities and I would like to hear from you soon. :)
It is good I thing it does not need any difference
It is good as it is. 
It is good and fair so far.
It is excellent 
It is early in the process but so far it has been normal and what I would have anticipated.
"It is disappointing to never hear anything from J&J about my application or the status of the position other than this survey.  I feel like there was not much value placed on my application and thus, as a J&J consumer,  I am feeling less valued as well…   I know people do not like form letters, but in this case, I would have appreciated at least that before getting a survey about my experience."
"It is difficult with a company of your size, but a personal phone call goes a long way during the recruiting process even if it is a turn down."
It is difficult to tell as applying online does not require much to do but filling out the application. Your application process ( I would not call it recruitment process) is similar to others so I would say it is the same process that companies follow. There is no remarkable difference.
"It is difficult for Canadians to obtain employment in the US perhaps for the need for sponsorship. If it is so, J&J is losing the opportunity to introduce new talents in US branches.
Jim"
"It is currently very early in the recruitment process so I cannot offer any insightful improvement comments at this time. However, providing feedback and updates to candidates during the process is very helpful, although understandably difficult given the volume of applications that Johnson & Johnson must receive. Thank you for asking!  "
It is better to update and inform the result in short time
It is better if J&J could update the application progress more frequently.
"It is best to send these surveys to candidates with whom you have had other correspondence for the position applied.  I've not heard anything (automated ""thanks but sorry..."" email, phone interview, etc) from Johnson & Johnson regarding my specific application process.  I expected some communication before being asked for my thoughts to improve your organization even if it is to at least that I am not a candidate."
"It is an excellent process, I would love to get feedback on my application status and where it is in the process."
It is always very helpful to the applicant to receive some insight on why they were not chosen for a particular role.
It is already good and would give options to user in the beginning to submit the old documents or new documents 
It is a very organized process.
It is a very long process with out clarity along the way. 
It is a simple and straight forward process.
It is a long process and after interviewing it takes too long to hear back on the position.
It is a little premature to take this survey without a call back for the job or interest from the company on my skill set.  You should really send this to people who qualify for an interview - the experience of applying for a job is tied to your ability to get the interview. 
It is a great process and working well for me at the present.
It has been very good up to this point.  I will include / increase the status update on how the individual is progressing the process lifecycle.    
It has been more than 2 weeks since I applied for the job and I have not been contacted yet. My friend who works at J&J mentioned how slow the hiring process was there. Will it be possible for the hiring process to be speed up some?
It has been an excellent process. I have no complaints. 
It has been almost 6 weeks since I submitted my application and the only communication I have received is the automatic email that confirms you submitted for the position.  I am assuming there is not interest in seeing me for the position but better communication would help. 
It has been a very easy process so far. I look forward to the opportunity to interview more. 
"It has been a great experience so far and I look forward to hearing from the HR on the next steps in the process. 
Kindest regards, Maria Istoc, global Clinical Operations Manager "
"It has been a few weeks since I applied, and would love to know if I am still being considered or if the position has been filled or not. "
It has been a couple of weeks and I have yet to hear back. Getting a more immediate response would help improve the process. 
"It has been 2 weeks without any indication that my resume has been reviewed, I would love to get a response sooner. With that being said, I understand that there are probably many applications coming in through the online system."
"It has always been my dream to work for J&J. 
The process, so far, is impecable.
Thanks."
it feels as if the selection process is done by a computer and not an actual person. I met all of the requirements and more and yet I was still not even called for an interview. 
"it does not give the chance to anyone who want to gain experience in their field of study. there are talents who don't have the experience but can do better
thanks"
"It does appear that many open positions have multiple locations.  When conducting an advanced search for openings and one would like to focus on a specific area/location, many positions will be shown.  Yet it isn't definitive that the preferred location is really available.  For example, setting the search parameters on a search for openings in Florida can yield openings in all of North America.
It is unclear if this means that remote work is allowable.

Otherwise the site is very easy to navigate and the application process is intuitive.

"
It covers most of the important aspects in the application process. The process is pretty smooth and straightforward. I have not yet experienced the process after the online application submission. 
It could send directly more private email job notification.
It could have more direct responses to applicants.
It could be easier to directly apply via Linkedin.
It could be beneficial if J&J consider video interviews to get a more personal experience with the interviewed candidates
it can provide work visa in the country because I live in Saudi Arabia with valid visa 
It can provide more opportunities to the graduates who really want to work with Johnson & Johnson 
It can provide a progression status as feedback to candidate as to where they are in the recruitment cycle.
"It can be hard for a large corporation to put a personal touch on the onboarding/recruitment process-- It could be very beneficial to ensure that each candidate is properly pre-screened and placed under the umbrella of the recruiter who might reach out to give the position a personal touch. However, this survey is definitely on the right track in that regard!

--Sam Manning"
It can add an online assessment test to screen candidates at an initial stage.
Is to long the process between the candidates interviewing 
Is there a way to know how the hiring works for the position? what is the lifestyle for the position? Is there a way to know if position can accompany for students taking classes part time and working at the same time?
Is there a chance open for me? Any feedback are highly appreciated.
Is taking so long to hear from recruiting group.
"Is outstanding, very clear and to the point."
"Is it possible for the job seekers to monitor the progress of a job?
Ex: 
xx/02/17 - xx/03/17 : Phone interview
xx-03/17 - xx-03/17 : In person interview
xx-03/17 - xx-04/17 : In person second interview
xx-04/17 - xx-04/17 : Final decision"
Is fine the way it is
Is excelent process
Involve human element
Invite me to an Interview!
Intuitive and quick process.  No recommendations for improvement. 
Interviewing the prospects
"Interview the candidates who match a great majority with the listed requirements.  In addition, it would be an advantage to JnJ to appreciate the many experienced candidates may be interested in a career change and have skills and other-position experience that may inform his/her performance and benefit JnJ."
"Interview qualified candidates like myself, not eliminate candidates without an interview."
"Interview qualified candidates for fix the description of what you are looking for.  I was well qualified for the role but never contacted by J&J outside of this survey. Yet the position has been posted for months.

 I would not consider applying to J&J again, based on this process."
Interview people who would be a great fit and beneficial to their company. 
"Interview people and communicate with them via email. I've just spoken to one recruiter in years of applying  - Samira Lopez, who was excellent. Unfortunately, she was interviewing me for a position that had moved forward in the interview process with their existing candidates."
Interview me.  I am not a piece of paper resume or a a fill in the blanks online app.  I have 20 years of experience worth of recognized experience influencing the decision of prescribers.  Interview me.
Interview me.
Interview me.
"Interview me, know me, give me an oppertunity to serve you and and allow me to be part of you. My promise, I will not disapoint you.

Thank you."
"Interview me! Also, follow-up with status updates on the application (call scheduled, interview, in progress, not accepted etc.)."
Interview me!
Interview me!
Interview me!
Interview candidates outside of the company. Not simply interview candidates that know people at the company. 
"Interview and hire me, I have extensive background and am ex-J&J and could help immediately. This is the first response I have gotten, have no idea if I am even being considered, any feedback would be appreciated on status"
Interview and hire me and you'll have no need to improve the recruiting process as you will have a great team in place.
Interview and hire candidates quicker 
Internal recruiters lack of follow up is extremely poor 
internal Job-Bit (change of job approval) could be a roadblock for talent that deserve a job position  improvement.
Internal candidates deserve to hear directly from the recruiter or hiring manager.
Interested in the fact that I have not heard back on my application but I'm getting a survey on the recruiting process.
"Interact with candidate, provide status updates of interest or not on a regular cadence. "
Interact more with the applicant. Since I applied to the position no communication was sent to me of what is the status of the position. If it being fullfield or not.
Intentional recruite diverse minority groups in the math and science field. 
Integration of Digital interview. By speeding up decision making follow ups
Integrate with Linkedin and Indeed for log in and resume.
Instructions were perfectly clear and divided by sections. No further instructions were needed during the application in order to understand the recruiting process.
"Instead of asking for Salary range to the candidate , the job salary range should be disclosed for each role to keep a fair/ transparent hiring process for everyone."
"Instead of an automated system, have a more personal level with applicants to update of the application process. "
"Instead of a HR  recruiter ,someone familiar with the details of the supply chain management who has competency to evaluate the resume of five/six pages
& not using standard auto selection thru key words search In case you are getting so many candidates with these skills & experience then I am wasting my time 
"
"Inquires sent via the recruitment/career website have gone unanswered, even to confirm receipt of question.  The impression this leaves is very dismissive."
"Initially, i was unable to apply for the position because the site would not allow for me to download my resume.  Then something else happened.  Luckily, when I went back a day or two later, that problem was corrected.  "
"Initially I received feedback the J&J received my application, but have no knowledge of the current status of the application.   "
Initial screening should be done from HR
Informing potential candidates as to when application window will be closed as well as when selection process of the candidate will be completed.
Informing candidates about progress of application/interview results.
"Informing applicants of a general time frame that the job will likely be filled.
"
Information on outcome of initial assessment and rationale for acceptance / rejection would be nice
Information on closing date is not always available; it would be nice to see it for all jobs.
Inform us if we are denied a job role
Inform the candidates more regularly on the progress of the selection process.
Inform the candidate if they have not been selected and explain in a line what skills the applicant lacked or how the applicant can improve his profile.
"Inform the applicant rather or not they have been considered for the job in which they are applying for, and also inform them of other opportunities in which they may be qualified for in reference to their resume."
"Inform the applicant early for future process, for example, If the skills set and experience match with the job requirements and  the job descriptions then inform the possibility of phone interview with in 2 weeks or let the applicant know that this process is not going further.
Thank you "
Inform people whether they are still being considered for the role.  This is the first correspondence that I have received since applying for the two-year IT Intern position.  
inform if not moving forward
"Inform candidates where theie application sits, and with whom. Timely acceptance and / or rejection feedback is critical to the applicant decision process, and a desirable courtesy."
Inform candidates when they have been rejected so they can focus on other opportunities. 
Inform candidates of there candidacy status as soon as possible once a decision has been made regardless of continued progress or rejection. 
Inform candidates if they are being considered and also notify candidates if they are not being considered.
Inform candidates even when they did not receive the job. 
"Inform candidates as to the reason why they weren't selected to move on in the hiring process. For example; too much experience, not enough experience, salary expectation was to high, skill set(s) didn't align with the role.

Candidates would like to know in order to be better prepared moving forward with other opportunities within Johnson & Johnson or another company."
"Inform candidate of application process, whether or not they are still being considered for position "
Inform candidate in an appropriate amount of time it they were selected or not. 
"Inform applicants of application process (i.e. where they stand, etc.)."
Inform applicants if they were chosen for interviews 
Inform applicant if they were not chosen for an interview and/or when the position is filled. 
Inform a potential candidate as to the status of getting an interview.
"Inform a future employee that this is not a ""spam"" email and is from J&J. I watched a special on J&J values and thought how wonderful a company to work for.
Best regards,
Dianne L. Pantanella"
Indicate what current JNJ roles you would like to pull from for roles.

indicate the actual job poster on sites like LinkedIn so that applicants can interact and possibly ask questions with a human face.
indicate out steps and time-lines of the recruitment process
Indicate a compensation package amount
Increased university recruitment programs.
Increased differentiation from other application process.  Talk about company culture and successful team contributions.
Increased communication. This is the only communication I have received surrounding the application.
"Increased communication with recruiters and candidates. Slow process between recruiter and hiring manager delays the process. 

"
Increased communication to candidates on why they weren't selected. 
Increase transparency on where you are in interviewing process
Increase the time span between initial application and the feedback to applicant's next step in the process.  
Increase the speed with which you respond to applications
"Increase the kilobyte size so candidates can attach documents in addition to cover letters and resumes, such as letters of recommendation and powerpoint presentations to assist J&J recruiters with additional insight as to what a candidate may have to offer. "
Increase the human touch factor. 
"Increase the human factor and decrease the ATS/computerized factor in the recruitment process.
I've applied for multiple positions with J&J in the recent past and have never once been able to get beyond the initial computerized filter (even though I have the full skill-set to carry out the duties described in the job description). I highly doubt a human has laid eyes on my resume in any of the positions I've applied to.
If the ATS is filtering me out - it is doing the same for other fully qualified applicants. J&J is missing out on strong potential employees, which is a shame. Moreover, this is hurting J&J's brand as an employer and as a company."
Increase the human contact factor - both at application review and post application follow-up.
Increase recruitment programs for veterans.
Increase orientation process to on-board new employees.
Increase one on one talk as either phone interview or group interview at the site. 
"Increase follow up. Notify candidates when their resume has been reviewed or update them if it's been a week or two and their application haven't been reviewed yet.  Example: ""Dear _________ (candidate), Thank you for your application for _________ (position), we wanted to let you know that the position is still open however we're extremely busy vetting our candidates so your resume hasn't been reviewed yet. Thank you for your patience."""
Increase feedback to candidates.
Increase advertisement on government installations. 
Incorporating automatic phone interviews for all candidates that meets the job description would be beneficial to the company. I believe that you will learn a lot about a candidate through a brief phone screening. 
Incorporate some intellectual question in recruitment process. process should not be longer.
Incorporate contractor's experience into consideration selection. 
"Incorporate a non liability/commitment short term voluntary program (i.e. 6 hours) recruitment process to establish hands on skills, interests and strengths that may assist with cross functions and future openings.
This voluntary program may benefit some departments workload to stay afloat and the recruitment process would be a resource for excellence in the workplace. 
Thank you."
Incorporate a military liaison for transitioning military. My skills my not be an exact match but I have no doubt I would excel at Johnson and Johnson.
"including possibility to post for a job without filling already existing infos in CV but directly sending the current and updated CV.
"
including  a video introduction of the prospect to show what positivity can bring to the company if it's hired.
Include the recruiter information for the role.  
Include the product portfolio associated with the position (link to PI after completing application).  This will be helpful in preparation for possible interview.
"Include the expectations of the candidate and what causes the opening of such position. 

Thank you.
Andrea T Solomon "
Include the culture of the company along with the job description
Include quick 2-4 minute videos of current associates in the role the incumbent is applying for to see a day in the life of a ______. This would allow the applicant to determine if their skills set fit the post. 
Include interviews by skype and home office´s job position. 
Include estimated time frame of when decision will be made.
Include early face to face interview to narrow down the candidate.
"Include an option to disclose potential accommodations for people with disabilities in the selection process. 

  
  "
"Include a voice message with the application.
This will the process more personal."
Include a follow up email if candidates are not moved forward in the interview process after an application is submitted. 
"In today's world, you apply in mass on a website.  This does not allow for the consideration of an applicant's experience and expertise."
"In this particular position there are very few candidates who ""fit the spec"" for the job.  J&J needs to recognize that it is important to offer a package that would incent the applicant to consider leaving their current employer for the job.  We aren't going to make a move for the same compensation and the cost of the move is prohibitive to the average individual.  I have received calls from multiple recruiters regarding this position.  So it is obvious that there aren't a lot of candidates who would meet the J&J standard.  Yet so far I have not received verification that I will be moving forward in the hiring process.  Still in limbo without feedback."
"In this letter, if it is actually a rejection letter, tell us you decided to go with other candidates, and provide good reasoning."
In this case interviews were set up very quickly after I posted for the job. It will just be good to see how long it takes to close the loop.
"In these days, I know if I don't have an inside person, it means that I have  absolutely no chance to get recruited by companies like J&J even my background fits the position perfectly. And, I know that many peoples finally get hired do not fit at all. This is the reality. You guys will not listen."
In the selection proces phone interview is not great tool in short listing candidates because most  times phone interview does not give proper opportunity to candidate to present themselves why they are good fit for the job . Aa a result company lose a candidate who is ready to give 100% to that job.
In the future I would hesitate from posting a job then canceling it. It gives people like myself false hope. 
"In the automatic response to the application, it will be helpful if the candidate can have a time frame on when the company initial decision will be made"
In the application process make it more specific (but no to be use to exclude the application based on meet or does not meet requirementme) to narrow down strong candidates and apply analytics to ensure the skills of the selected candidates are strong then the interview process will rely more in evaluate fits and soft skills. (thank you for asking my opinion)
"In terms of recruitment, I think Johnson & Johnson is doing a great job in communicating well with its applicants. If there's one thing I think an applicant like me would love J&J to improve on is its flexibility in communicating with the outside people who are waiting patiently for results of the application progress a.k.a applicants. Aside from email, J&J could also send an update through sms and I think, that way, it is more direct, personal and faster. Thanks! :)"
"in term of  website,  if  you type a  job  title , then,  location  can be filtered and  open date can be sorted."
"In short, Invite me to take the next step in the selection process.  I am confident in my abilities and in the value that I would bring to J&J as an employee and leader.  I look forward to meeting and discussing this opportunity with the hiring manager and ultimately joining the J&J team.

Thank you for your consideration.

"In order to improve the recruitment process, my suggestion is to improve transparency with respect to the process.  After submission of the application online, there is no way of knowing if your application is considered, the time frame for such consideration, or how to follow up if need be.  For example, I received this survey request, but have not heard back from J&J regarding whether I am even moving forward in the process. "
"In order for this company to improve, they can begin by offering me to come in for an Interview. I worked with Johnson& Johnson members for team building at my current job and they said only 20% of the time an online application will reach an actual person. So it would be in your company's favor to bring me in for an actual interview so that I dont have to be rejected by a computer monitor. I am over qualified in most areas for that job considering my masters provided me training in a more difficult field. Let me know if you are interested in my candidacy please. Thank you, have a wondeful day!"
In my view the company recruiting team strongly exercise discrimination and do not use fair practice pick and choose and or block candidate and or use heavily questions that determine racial profile.
In my view Process is really unique. I am just experienced till submitting an application never been into the actual recruiting process with Johnson& Johnson to talk more about the process but I don't think it needs changes.
"In my specific case I requieres VISA sponsorship, it could be very helpfull if you indicate if there is a real chance for a candidate with fit 100% on the rol but does not have the legal papers to work on USA currently."
In my search I have found many online application processes oppressive... demanding non-salient information.  Your process was refreshingly intuitive and efficient...thanks!
"In my opinion, I believe it would be beneficial for candidates to have the ability to periodically view an update of their application status during the recruitment process. "
"In my opinion,  viable candidates applying for a position should receive a phone call within 72 hrs. of submitting their application. If a resume looks good visually, the story behind it tends to be even better. Face to face communications add much more value than hitting the send button on an email.
Thank you in advance for your consideration in selecting me as your primary candidate.
I look forward to receiving a phone call from your team.
Best regards,

In my opinion the recruitment process of Johnson and Johnson is good.
"In my experience, the single most-important function of recruitment is to begin and sustain a dialog, including responding with candor and realism. Your process is one of the most sensitive to this function that I have seen."
"In most cases, I have had good experience applying to positions in J&J, but in this particular case, I received the rejection even before applying.
Does not make sense. Regardless, I applied after the rejection as this was a referred position, but I have not heard from you guys. Now that I have received this communication, I understand that my application is not being considered. Nevertheless, it is very silly to receive rejection before application"
"In many cases human resources personnel do not understand exactly what is done in a position, so they discard people with talent, or people that  do not have all the experience, but they can develop the work, so they must involve in a more close way, the people with somebody will directly work, in the process of searching for a new position.

En muchas ocasiones el personal de recursos humanos no entiende exactamente que se hace en una posición, por lo que descartan personas con talento, o bien que, aunque no tienen la experiencia pueden desarrollar el trabajo, por lo que deben involucrar de una forma mas cercana a las personas con las que directamente se va a trabajar en el proceso de busqueda para una nueva posición. "
In it's the current state the process is fluid and simple to follow. Without seeing the entire process it would unfair to make an assessment.
"In general, I find job postings to be a bit cold. This is not exclusive to J&J. It would be nice if the role was not so objectively described. Things like analytical skills and verbal communication should be a given for a role of this caliber. I would rather weed out of the noise and read the high level objectives. The company and products are excellent. I guess to me, the question of why the role is open and what J&J is looking to accomplish would help me understand how my skills would apply and what I can do to help J&J deliver the desired results. A parallel could be drawn to Buffet's single page executive summary philosophy. "
"In general, a quicker turn-around in the initial selection process would be very welcomed. "
"In fairness to all applicants;

To have an open mind and consider candidates from all Schools. To provide an opportunity to prove themselves as worthy candidates to applicants from different backgrounds.

A great employee must be willing to learn a new job and by providing opportunities Johnson & Johnson will contribute to our community success.

To at least call candidates before rejecting resumes.

Thank you for your time

In every application salary with currency should be stated or given option to choose from.
"In case J&J does not do this at some point, I would like to recommend that sales rep candidates do a mock sales call.  This will insure that resume accolades square with reality."
In Apply would be helpful through LinkedIn so that the user does not have to be directed to the J and J website.  
"In answering some of the preliminary online questions, there were two questions about salary - my current salary and the salary range I hope to be in if offered a position. Currently, I only work 30 hours/week, and my salary reflects that. But there is no question that asks whether or not the user works full or part-time. The salary I hope to receive at J&J is assuming a 40 hour work week, so the option I chose was much higher than what I am currently making. It would be useful for the user to state, or choose, approximately how many hours he/she is working currently. The answer would align more with the salary range chosen for a future position."
"In all the interviews I have had for this and other positions requested were intervals of more than 3 weeks between one interview and another. The process was very long and disorganized. Human resources canceled appointments one or two days before the interview. In order to be very disappointed with the process since in all the positions that I request in Ethicon & Depuy Synthes, I reached the finals for my experience of 17 years selling medical devices and all positions were canceled or postponed."
"In 2016 I had signed up using alternate e-mail and  had lost username and password.

Had difficulty resetting using prior email"
Improving transparency would be a great first step to improve the process
"Improving the website used for applying for a role would be helpful, as there were some technical issues that were difficult to resolve and may cause people to not apply (if they can't figure out what the problem is).

Talent Acquisition/hiring staff seem to be overlooking on the job experience and other education and focusing too much on having a Bachelor's degree.  Many organizations are now questioning the actual value of a Bachelor's degree and giving more recognition to actual work experience and more specific post university education/training."
Improving communication to the applicant.Thanks 
"Improvements to the process would include:
Follow up with candidates after application is submitted. (I received an automated response after applying on 3/27 but never received status updates)

Notify candidates when / if position is filled.

A plus to Johnson & Johnson recruitment process is letting candidates know that their profile information has been entered into your candidate database.  An improvement would be to periodically inform candidates within that database of all open positions."
"Improvement will always be a part in any field.
Have to constant growth in IT will lead us more employee to detach for their relevant field."
"Improvement to provide feedback the progress application evaluation - such as a percentage spread sheet, dashboard or graph.  This could also be shared internal with interview panel and hiring management."
"Improvement requests for the recruitment process;

- Status of the application submittal
- Past experience acknowledgement at Johnson & Johnson
- Contract positions availability or upcoming
- Reason for not being chosen
- Notice of position filled, pending, etc.
- Notice of future projects or new positions to apply
 
Thank you!"
Improvement on feedback time would be beneficial
"Improvement depends on the needs and goals of a specific organization.
Under all circumstances to improve any organization you need inter alia:
- Some mixture of experiences seniors and juniors. 
- A unit of development and training is badly needed in an organization of J&J level and nature of business.
- Some due attention is to be given for the feedback comes from third parties.
- Legal risk management is of a basic nature."
Improved rate of follow up with candidates. 
"improved feedback on application - a faster turn around to provide all applicants with status allowing the individual to manage his / her own expectations.
"
"Improved engagement 
Feedback
Better information of amount of experience required for role"
"Improved communication from the hiring team.  For example, I would like periodic updates on where is the hiring manager/recruiter in the hiring process, such as ""applicant screening,"" or, ""interview scheduling.""  I would also like to know, ""No progress due to company meetings,"" or something like that. "
"Improve turnaround time:                             1. Application process.                                  2. Interview request.                                     3.

Improve timely response to applicant.
Improve their reputation by getting back to all applicants not just those you are interested in. People would feel better treated.
Improve the status tracking of applications
Improve the status of current job applications and feedback.
Improve the efficiency and diversity by giving more candidates a chance to be considered: e.g. letting them submit an online proposal to solve a job-related sample project/problem.
Improve the ease of uploading a new resume.
Improve the communication process.  There has been no feedback from the recruiter at all and I submitted my resume more than 1 week ago.  I would suggest reaching out to the candidates within one week or less with an update on the status of the submission and a timeline for the screening process and interview cycles.
Improve the communication process with your applicants. Don't let the only 2 communication steps be the acknowledgement of the application and the rejection.
"Improve the communication after submitting the application. 
Sometimes there is no response sent and also no meeting is scheduled. So the candidate just has to assume he/she is not selected."
Improve the automatic feed from the resume to the online application.  Data had to be copied and pasted into the online application to make the information accurate and complete.
Improve the application website.
improve the  communication with the applicants 
Improve response time and feedback to candidates.
Improve replying process either by acceptence or rejection
Improve process for ensuring qualified candidates have an opportunity to compete for the position.
Improve on follow up to applications
improve more on some specified skills of the applicants 
Improve job search functionality. It is not easy to find jobs sometimes until Requisition number is entered.
"Improve follow up on applications, just received one email saying my application was received but did not receive any feedback to see if I was considered or not for the position."
Improve follow up communications. After several months still no feedback on application
Improve feedback to candidates. 
Improve feedback time
Improve feedback on the application process. I have only been notified that the application has been received. You need to improve this.
Improve feedback on status 
Improve feedback and follow up.  Never know if the resume reached the intended mgr. Black hole response.
Improve communication with the prospective candidate and provide timely feedback as the process takes months without any communication from HR.
Improve communication regarding posting process
"Improve communication in process
Improve interview scheduling and coordination efficiency(so slow in the process that already received two offers from other companies)"
Improve communication and make it more personal
Improve communication and give feedback even when not chosen.
Impression of recruitment process to date is very positive.  Looking forward to meeting with hiring director/team.
Impressed with Talent agent a great representative for J&J.
Impressed with communication turn around time!
"Implementing a more in-depth application process would improve the recruitment process. This would allow applicants to provide employers with a better understanding of their skills, experience, and attitude. "
Implementation of standard QbD in the recruitment process.
Im not in a interview yet
ignore nepotism
"If your company truly embraces diversity, then you have to understand not everybody walks a clear path to their career goal. Some people have to break down walls and fight for every opportunity that comes their way, which means having to accept temporary assignments to gain the skill and experiences needed to be successful in every aspect of business. It does not mean they are incapable of commitment.  

Just because people aren't cookie-cuter does not mean they are not qualified. I have yet to get a face to face interview while my friend (white) has with far less experience and achievements.  
"
"If your company is not already, I would suggest either attending job fairs for transitioning Veterans like myself or establishing an unpaid fellowship or internship  program specifically for transitioning wounded, injured, or ill veterans for the 2-4 months they are waiting on final disposition from the Department of Veterans Affairs.  This would provide an easier transition to civilian employment and introduction to corporate culture, while the company can get to know a candidate to see where he or she would best fit within the company. The SOCOM Care Coalition is always looking for large corporations to partner with, and they have a website and Facebook page which tell a little bit about the organization. "
"If you're going to reject someone, don't send them an email telling them so.  It's very insulting, especially when you feel you have the qualifications to succeed at the role, and are told there are others who are better qualified.  It left a very bitter taste in my mouth."
"If you could provide a window of when a candidate who you will be talking to might hear from you, that would be helpful. 

e.g. we expect to be contacting individuals in the next ....(30, 60, 90 days) to further discuss their qualifications."
"If you can make sure benefit mention in position, it will be great to chance to more considerable."
"If you can let candidates know whether they are or are not being considered in a timely manner, it would be great.  Having no indication weeks after submitting a resume is a bit disheartening for those who are looking for a new opportunity with a great employer.

Thank you.

If you are hiring for a position why do you deny an applicant online without meeting them in person?
If they would to be able to give a time stamp as to when the people that apply can respond back.
"If they could update candidates faster about their job application, it would be very effective and appreciated."
If they can get back to the applicants even if they are not considered would be a great help.
If they can explain in Application  about  the  Process and  Times.
"If there is anyway to update the applicant's job application, it would be very convenient & beneficial for us. Other than that, it was really easy to apply and very straight forward which was nice to see."
"If there is a point of contact to followup with my application, that would be great! Otherwise the application itself is very clear and instructions are prescriptive. "
If there are not hundreds of applicants (which I assume may be the case for this role) it would be nice to receive even very minimal feedback as to why candidates have not been selected to move forward.
If the updates can be provided much faster.
"If the survey is a first step in the process of being considered, then no need for improvement.

If the survey simply goes to all applicants, regardless of whether or not the applicant is being considered, then I think the process could be improved, by surveying applicants further in the process.  "
If the process has ended please let us know. After applying this is my first unique communication besides the confirmation e-mail. 
If the position required a Ph.D as the minimum then the minimum requirements should not state a BS degree as the minimum. That is a huge lack of attention to detail for a scientist position.
if talent aquisition can reach out on time.
"If rejected, it would be nice to know more specifics in order to try to improve for future opportunities."
"If referred by a recruiter, say something at the end about getting back to this company about arranging an interview through them if you agree with the fit and a time frame as to when that will happen. The hardest thing about looking for a job is no knowing what is happening. Thank you."
"If possible, provide feedback on declined applications."

If possible provide quick reply on results for recruitment 
If possible improve the our source search engine.  May have been user error but I had to find out the Req# in order to then find the job....my searches did not find it.

The candidate has no idea if resume is sitting in cyber space.  Has anyone reviewed it?  Have you communicated in a timely fashion back to the applicants?  "
"If it's a referral, it should at least lead to an interview. Doesn't have to guarantee an offer to the job, but there must be a reason someone asked for a referral for that position. Also, don't look for someone that fits the exact skills that you are looking for. While some may be working in an unrelated field, they could also have the skills to fulfill the duties of the position that they applied for. "
"If it is promised to ""contact you soon"" that could be done within a month. Application was sent more then a month again, and still in a ""received"" phase. 40 calendar days are not enough for review? If not, that could be communicated. "
"If it is possible, provide a situation for some people with high qulification to have a chance to present themselve and put some voice or face on the paper(resume). Perhaps you can evaluat us by asking some questions or listening to our story. Just a suggestion. "
"If I recall correctly the application process at the very beginning of the process was extremely lengthy and asked for much of the same information provided by the resume. Removing requests for duplicative information at the start would be an improvement. It also was a lengthy process, 3 months from application to offer but it was well organized and everyone was helpful along the way. "
If I approach the next step in the job application I'd like to know rather than not at all.

"If available, Talent Aquisitions that are able to answer quick questions of applicants "
"If applicants do not meet requirements, explain what they could do to further themselves and become a stronger candidate for the future. "
"If answer is ""No"", provide a comment section to explain.  
Example:  Regarding a question of a specific system requirement as ""Advance"" knowledge.  If answer No, then have an opportunity to explain why - I've used the systems and familiar; but didn't feel I was Advanced.  This could be a deal breaker to even have the opportunity to be considered as a candidate for an interview.  When in reality having my extensive experience I would be a good fit and bring added value to the position."
"If an internal candidate applies, at least schedule time to talk to them to better understand their skills and interest"
If an employee is applying continuously with skills set matching for his profile sometimes his points matches completely and somwtime it may happen he misses some points but what in case of person like me who had applied from last ten years on your no. of jobs posted and still waiting with patience that jnj is fair in calling for interview atleast but not a single chance given now my experience is to director level jobs .Lets decide HR are you still keep me in waiting line or keep me rejecting because I don't have internal reference of big management person.I hopeful that jnj HR is not just a showoff HR company is keeping.But when you will interview me?I am 38now from 28.YOU DECIDE 
"If an applicant submits an application, follow up. The automated prompt is appropriate for submission confirmation, however it would be more beneficial to receive some feedback from a person."

Ideally it would be nice to get a response within a week or so of applying with a sense for how good a match I am (or am not) for the role
Id like a face to face interview 
"I've submitted resume and applications to several positions that fits perfectly
my extensive experiences and have been employed by J&J for 11 years many years ago. Obviously your talent team apparently did not considered my perfect qualifications probably due to my age. I never got a response from the selection team as the position announcement continued for many months gathering huge amount of applicants. I was the third choice (the two declined the offer) when I was hired by J&J and they loved my work as I contributed greatly to the department. So what's on paper is not the best choice, but the best candidate's resume is in the waste basket."
"I've solid experience in sourcing chemicals and travelled worldwide to bring the best quality chemicals with affordable price to my clients. My business strategy was successful and would like to bring these skills to J&J. But few days ago  I received an email confirming that my application for this position was unsuccessful. 

Selection process based on merit would give a confidence to candidates looking to work for J&J. I personally believe J&J recruiters didn't give due consideration to my application for the position. "
"I've received no feedback from the submission until this survey, I'll assume I'm no longer under consideration given the receipt of the survey. Perhaps it would be helpful to have a communication after losing the opportunity - I'll check the website now.
Thank you!"
I've only completed the application process not the screening on anything else. Until I have completed more processes will I have some better feedback to share.
I've only applied online so the process seems to be good.
"I've not spoken to anyone yet. That said excellent communication between the recruiter and candidate is very important. This is already a stressful process, so clear and timely communication can reduce the candidates stress level. "
I've not noticed anything yet. 
"I've never heard back from a recruiter about the jobs I applied for. I think at least an email of some sort should have been sent to me informing me that I wasn't selected. I see the job postings and articles on LinkedIn and I've never been contacted by anyone regarding my skills, experience, and background. I could be a great fit and an asset to the company, however; you'll never know since no one has reached out to me. "
"I've had the opportunity to recruit for my current employer at two major colleges in the Northeast, and Johnson & Johnson has been a clear leader in the field of talent & acquisition at college campuses.  As an experienced hire with a good leadership experience and career progression with my current company, the only networking opportunities that I have with 'employers of interest' seem to be through Linked In, or through my college alumni network.  I believe that I bring exceptional skills and experience to any employer, but due to different industry experience, I struggle with which roles I would be best suited for given a difference in industries.  I wonder if there is a way that Johnson & Johnson could incorporate networking opportunities into the experienced hire process, in a similar fashion to campus recruiting, in an effort to both pre-screen talent and recommend roles for open opportunities within the JNJ organization. Whether it be through mentorship, online chatrooms, or in-person events, I think it may be an innovative concept that I have not seen any major CPG explore (in platform other than general experienced hire career fairs).  You could perhaps leverage the list of applicants / candidates with online profiles as the target market for networking opportunities - these folks seem to have a passion for your company and an interest in JNJ.  Food for thought.  Trash or treasure."
"I've gotten three emails about this survey but I haven't actually heard anything about the position I applied for roughly a month ago. How can I give an accurate impression of the process before the process has actually been completed? For example, how could I know if the job description is clear if the only information I have on the job is from the description? Wouldn't I need further information (discussion with HR, experience in the position...) to corroborate the job description?

Secondly, it would be nice to know where my application is in the review process. I hope that the Talent Acquisition team understands how these survey requests can seem callous given the lack of communication regarding the actual job application."
"I've enjoyed 13 years in the medical device industry and have established many great relationships through networking. The one suggestion I would make is to make sure referrals from within the company are followed up with a courtesy call. Even if a viable candidate is already in line for the position, it's out of respect for fellow employees that you return a call and politely inform their referral of the situation. At a minimum, you need to correspond with the employee. Many great finds come from employees already within a company. Following up with them instills pride, loyalty, and a devotion that drives a persons dedication which ultimately translates into more for a companies bottom line. "
I've been applying to several marketing roles in the area.  And J&J had one of the simplest and slickest processes.   I wouldn't change anything. 
"I've been applying to Johnson & Johnson for years and I have never received an interview even though, in my opinion, I am a perfect fit for the positions I've responded to. I understand that each hiring manager is looking for specific skills and that Johnson & Johnson must receive thousands of resumes, but to never once receive a call or first round consideration tells me that the recruitment process is extremely narrow and that numerous qualified candidates are being immediately disqualified. My suggestion is to expand your parameters - you might be surprised at the amazing talent you attract. "
"I've applied to several positions for which the description is related to my bacground and experiences.  I hear from temp recruiters you secure, and interviews are scheduled and then never followed up on.  It's a poor system.  And then when I reach out to recruiter, they are no longer working for you or that assignment.  I've yet to receive a formal interview.   "
"I've applied to probably a half dozen or so openings at Johnson & Johnson over the years and have always received a rejection email. I appreciate the response, even if it's a rejection, rather than wondering if my application was even received. I do, however, have over 20 years of healthcare IT experience implementing major projects, director level responsibilities, and feel I'm worthy of at least an HR phone screening, no? And I live right in Raynham:  mikeshea17@yahoo.com if you change your mind. As for the application process, it's one of the better ones I've seen. "
"I've applied to J&J quite a bit over the past two years. I target the company, because I believe in its products. I will say I'm THRILLED with your new Careers page and, specifically, the application process. In my opinion, yours was the longest, most convoluted application process I had ever seen ... and now it's one of the best (along with Amex). Kudos to you guys. Very well done."
"I've applied to a few jobs over the years - many of which I was either highly qualified or even over qualified to possess. 

I've sent my resume and credentials through the online process, through friends/neighbors who are employees and I even once reached out directly to HR personnel via LinkedIn. 

Despite those efforts, credentials and connections, I've never received a single call to even interview with the company. 

Side note: I've managed over a $1.4 billion dollars in my sales leadership career and I'm a six-time corporate management award recipient. I guess only $1.5+B and 7+-time winners need to apply. "
I've applied for several positions with your reputable company which is a target company for me.  However I continue to get automated rejection notices.  Just wondering if these are actually automated based on keywords in my resume or if it is a manual effort where someone actually looks at the resume and decides that the skill set is not a good fit.  Would love to have an opportunity to chat with someone in person.   Thank you.
"I've applied for many positions with J&J and I feel the application process is clear and concise but it tends to be more technology driven.(as most companies) I feel that for J&J to really make a difference and stand out from the industry, the recruitment process needs a more face to face selection method from the initial phase of recruiting people.  What I mean is that J&J recruiters and hiring managers should reach out into their communities and hold more in person recruiting as was the case in years past through job fairs etc.(credo driven) This provides quality candidates the equal opportunity to shine initially in person rather than ""de-selected"" through tech driven processes."
"I've always wanted to work for J&J, but I do believe, after applying to a few jobs, that one thing that could improve is advertising job postings better. I feel like I'm always behind in applying because I missed the new job posting. "
"I'm very unimpressed with J&J's career recruitment process. As someone who is trying to find opportunities to better myself, it was very disappointing to apply to multiple positions to receive zero feedback and was sent a lazy form email that J&J ""identified a group of candidates that more closely meets the needs of the business and will not be pursuing your candidacy for this position"". "
I'm very satisfied and impressed with the application process and the follow through. Thank you
"I'm very qualified for this position, but have not heard anything about my candidacy for it and whether a decision has been made about it."
I'm very much satisfied with the process.
"I'm very impressed by the recruitment process, and thank you for your time!"
"I'm very disappointed in J&J's recruitment process.
I posted my interest for 2 interesting roles where there was a 100% fit, but no reply at all, not even an automated one.
Not sure I would recommend J&J as an employer to other talents."
I'm sure you have got this before but you can consider me for the position..
I'm sure the recruitment process is a huge undertaking with the size of J&J. I thought the process was easy and straightforward. Thank you
"I'm sure that this position isn't suited for any sales professional....I've worked with many successful reps who simply wouldn't fit in well with the medical world in my opinion. I've sold IT, Services, Industrial and more.....and fit in well with medical professionals. I think that an intelligence test or profile test might allow for a more accurate snapshot of who is behind the resumes you receive and review. Obviously other factors exist that can only be assessed with a face to face interview....but judging a highly skilled rep by the employers he/she has had would be a mistake and leave some of the most highly skilled and intelligent reps overlooked. I've received many responses saying, ""Your skill set doesn't match the candidate we are seeking"". I've always found this frustrating due to the fact that I would fit into the medical device sales arena or related field far better than a few of the jobs I have taken in the past simply because those were the only options at the time, or the money was right.  Other than that, you seem to aggressively seek out candidates and are very clear as to the candidate you are seeking in my opinion. "
"I'm sure Johnson & Johnson receives many resumes which prohibits regular feedback to applicants, however, it would be beneficial to hear from the talent acquisition team regarding opportunities and potential job matches. "
"I'm sure J&J is overwhelmed with candidate but if you could find a way to acknowledge and give feedback in a more personal way, candidate would be extremely impressed.

J&J has made the process very easy."
"I'm still unaware of my status, but by this email. I would assume I didn't qualify even though my qualifications are far beyond the requirements.
Thanks,
Walter"
"I'm still not sure where I am in the process. Everyone I had contact was extremely helpful and extremely pleasant. Neither the listing, nor my conversations with four different people left me with an entirely clear sense of what the the expected outcomes of the work would be, or of how the proposed position fit into the larger structure of the group I would be joining."
I'm still in the process but the amount of time and follow up between phone screen and manager interview was over a week and without anything scheduled it left me wondering. I would like more communication. 
I'm still awaiting a call as to wether I'll be considered for this role so I'm surprised to receive this survey before I know if the process is continuing or if I was rejected before being interviewed.
I'm satisfied very much with the details provided. Thank you
I'm not very fond of the new job posting website. Job descriptions do not list a pay grade or date when the job was posted. This was very helpful information. The actual process of applying was convoluted. I didn't really apply for a position but couldn't back out of it or save it to continue later. The only option was to submit for the job and I hadn't even completed looking at the job questionnaire. I find that it is not very user friendly. The old eferral system was much easier to use and had a more logical flow. It also feels odd not signing in or out of the new system.
"I'm not sure, if my application was reviewed. A feedback [interested in the candidate or NOT] for such strategic and senior positions would be a welcome thing!"
"I'm not sure, I haven't heard from anyone yet."
"I'm not sure, I got a turndown within a couple hours.  I have filled out the survey so I no longer get all these emails.  "
"I'm not sure, but the recruitment process is strong relative to other companies processes. "
I'm not sure where I stand in the process so good communications is key.
"I'm not sure what you are looking for with this survey.   JDs are always very descriptive, but as a hiring manager, HR never understands what you really need.  So applicants range from ""have no clue"", to really great but don't define th exact requirements you list.... and therefore, you never see."
"I'm not sure what else can be improved as the recruitment process was very efficient, quick and easy. "
I'm not sure that there is anything that would be realistic.  I'd love to know if I'm still being considered but that's it.
"I'm not sure if there has been any updates to my application. Please review applicant Corey Roman, 8 years EHS experience, Top Secret security clearance with Polygraph. 908-397-3176, Coreyroman85@yahoo.com. Looking to relocate into the Greater Philadelphia area to be closer to family. "
I'm not sure if I was rejected or am still in consideration. Was a rejection letter sent?
"I'm not sure I saw a salary associated with each position, but that would be helpful, although I know it's difficult to post such information. "
I'm not sure being that JNJ has never recruited me. I've always worked at JNJ through other agencies and I'd rather be here directly through JNJ. 
I'm not sure as I only submitted the application and haven't heard back.
I'm not sure anyone every reach out to me to tell me they had reviewed my resume.
"I'm not sure about your whole process because i wasn't contacted at all outside this current email. So, i'm unfamiliar with your complete process and would like to be contacted about how your process works. I believe the job and opportunity would be awesome, a perfect fit for my skills and background as a county & state leader; as someone who's spoken to national audience; and who's had success teaching and coaching others locally!"
I'm not far enough into the process to respond.
I'm not even sure if I was considered for this role. More feedback about consideration of a role along with why the candidate was or was not selected would be helpful. 
I'm just beginning the process so I'm not entirely sure. I enjoyed Johnson & Johnson's online system and found it easier to navigate than others. 
"I'm disappointed that there hasn't been any response positive or negative. I have no idea if I'm still being consider or if other candidates are a better fit. I like J&J as a company and have known only positives about the company. I know you receive many applications and that it must be a huge undertaking to sort through it all. I feel like I would be an asset and a long term resource as it is very similar to the role I had at Eli Lilly, as Automation Manager for the clinical trials/product development department. I look forward to the next steps. I did like the Internet experience applying for the role, it was very intuitive. "
"I'm currently employed by Johnson and Johnson.  Unfortunately I never heard from HR or management regarding this posting, my application and/or mutual interest in the open position.  "
"I'm a veteran and for the past 20+ years I have been training, leading, and developing Supply Chain personnel in the concepts, regulation, policies and principles of logistics operations and procedures. To include leading the sole Air Force Supply Chain schoolhouse graduating 11,000 students annually.  Yet, I don't think my experience was recognized for this position.  "
I'm a very interested and qualified applicant. I would be interested to know why I haven't been considered 
"I'm a J&J employee and I'm not a fan of the new application platform. The system was cumbersome and less intuitive for how to upload files and navigate screens. I had to relog in a couple times because it froze up while using Chrome. I couldn't delete a file that I uploaded inadvertently.  
Even before I applied to this position, I found it difficult to search in My Next Step for postings. I miss the old Career Connections site/process."
I'm a good worker I would be a great employee..I will decicate my self to be a great worker for Johnson and Johnson 
"I'd suggest taking a holistic approach to viewing a ""new grad"" or a person who has left their job to look for another."
I'd say make Phone call to 90 of the applicants to make sure you don't miss out on the best candidate.=)
"I'd really appreciate if I could be updated on the progress of hiring or results.

Thanks "
"I'd love to hear from a recruiter if they think I'd be a good fit for Johnson & Johnson, even if not in the role for which I applied. That feedback would be useful in tailoring my current development so that I can be a stronger candidate in the future. "
I'd like to have a face to face interview.
"I'd like the reason(s) why I wasn't selected for the position.  I believe it's unprofessional for a company such as yourself to send out a ""blanket statement"" informing me that you decided not to pursue me as a candidate for the position without reason.  Please start providing feedback to the applicants in order to better inform them why they're were not considered.  If it will benefit the applicants more than the HR department who has 0 inclination on what qualifications are needed for each role. "
"I wouldn't change a thing if I fit and meet the qualifications for this position I would love to hear from a recruiter. Excited and looking forward to hearing your recruiting team 

Thank You!!"
I would use less jargon in your requirements and focus more on the values that will really make a difference to the potential recruits and recruiters alike.
I would use an easier application process like Jobvite.
I would truly appreciate if the process included communication / updates to the candidates after the initial application.
"I would think that someone with 20 years experience in face to face sales and an MBA might be worth at least a phone screen, but I guess not to J&J."
I would suggest to give a serious consideration to applicants with no prior direct experience in the job if they seem to have promising background of education and skills. They could be hired under training for certain period of time and if they proved themselves then they should be hired for the job. 
"I would suggest that J & J not rely solely on the ATS to do initial screening of applicants. Algorithms miss excellent candidates, such as me. I have all of the hard and soft skills listed for the job I applied for, and all the required education, experience and expertise. Yet I was not contacted by J & J. This was disappointing since the job was an excellent fit for me. "
I would suggest sending a survey such as this sooner during the application process for more accurate feedback. 
I would suggest communicating whether or not a potential candidate will be considered for next steps in the recruitment process prior to inviting a candidate to participate in a survey regarding the application process. It can be quite disappointing to receive a survey invitation regarding the process and not receive notification regarding your candidacy status.
I would suggest a wider selection of job field preferences when completing a profile.  I was not able to find 'Project Manager' from the drop down selection.  My selections don't fully represent what I am looking for.  Thank you for your time.
I would suggest a system that integrates the J&J jobs and taleo domains more seamlessly.
I would share my ideas if I had the job opportunity. Thank you!
"I would say the communication on the lapse between phone interviews, in-person interviews, and final communication of notification of getting the role. I realize there are many outside forces that make the process longer, but a answer to follow up email/phone calls regarding where in the process would be great! Thank you for taking this into consideration."
"I would say that Johnson & Johnson should be quicker about communicating with its applicants. For example, I received an e-mail with a survey regarding the application process several weeks after applying. Had I not been as extremely interested in this position, I might have forgotten the format and therefore would be giving back useless information for the survey. I also think that it is important to notify applicants if Johnson & Johnson is no longer considering them for the position. Another useful feature for Johnson & Johnson's recruitment process would be adding text boxes next to the various programs or applications of which J&J are requiring the use of to applicants. That way, applicants get the chance to explain to what extent and in what environments they have used said programs and applications. "
I would say much better communication is needed. I was kept in the dark and clear communication was not provided.  Also twice managers were very late to their local interview with no explanation. 
"I would say hire me but that doesn't help you with the Survey. On a serious note, I think companies need to evolve from having candidates fill out applications on line. In this technology driven environment there has to be a better way to screen candidates for key roles. None the less from a J&J perspective your reputation speaks for itself and I think many apply in the hopes that they may get an opportunity to work for a great company."
I would say better communication. I have not had any correspondence from the company since submitting my resume either positive or negitive. I would like to know if my skills and experience are of interest to the company or not so that I might pursue other options.  
I would say a follow-up email of where each candidate stands in the recruitment process. I applied for these roles indicated in this survey but have yet to be contacted by a recruiter. I have no idea where I stand in the selection process as of today.
I would recommended more human interaction. 
"I would recommend staying with the same recruiter throughout the entire process. In the first steps of the interviewing process I was screened by one recruiter. After emails and phone calls over the first month of the interview process I had created a trust with this recruiter. After completing my third interview at the facility I was told I would hear back from my recruiter once a decision was made. A week went by and I then had to initiate communication just to find out that another recruiter was ""formulating an offer."" Another week had passed and no word from this newly named recruiter. Finally at the end of the third week I received an email with benefit information. Then the next day I was asked if I had time for a call with the recruiter. I promptly responded, but heard nothing until the following day. From an applicant's point a view this was frusterating but it did work out in the end and I accepted the offer. "
"I would recommend JNJ to divide job requirements into two categories:
Main or Major requirements:  Candidate must have in order to be considered for posted job opportunity.
Minor requirements:  Candidates are preferred to have such skills.

"
"I would recommend J&J to post available positions online especially during career fairs such as National Society of Black Engineer Conference (NSBE). This will allow potential candidates to learn more about the position and determine if it's a good fit prior interviews.

Overall, staff members are really friendly and make the interview process so smooth. Well done!!

"
I would recommend having recruiters follow up with all internal recommendations. This allows you to ensure you continue to collect warm leads. I have been recommended for several roles by internal employees and recruiters and have spoken to one recruiter through LinkedIn regarding the status of a role. This could damage the great reputation of the company as well as deter high performing employees from applying. This also make employees feel that their recommendations are not valued or considered and can lead to disengagement of employees regarding the recruitment process. 
I would recommend giving professionals from external environments the opportunity to adapt to the medical environment with the intent of growing a career.
I would recommend an Johnson &Johnson providing and overview of the timeline of the application process. It would be beneficial for a candidate to be able to be able to track the status of the submission. 
"I would recommend additional communication of the status and level of interest in the candidate. Setting expectations of next steps and whether there is consideration given to other opportunities which might also be a match for the candidate's skills, knowledge and experience."
I would really love to be contacted regarding this position. I have yet to hear via email or phone regarding my application status. 
I would preferred to have a person provide me the information about me and the position. Feedback via computer in basically a jab in the eye with a sharp stick.
"I would prefer if you have your own recruitment system, Taleo an iCism (not sure if this is the correct spelling)  are ... lets say complicated. I have to maintain 3 separate logins in order to apply and search for jobs at J&J. Also, I can't find my application history, jobs that I applied previously.

Other then that GREAT company to work for, I hear from my friends.

Atanas Tepavitcharov "
"I would prefer a more specified application for the position looking to be filled.  I'm not a big fan of one application for all.  Its important to allow an applicant to explain his or her reasoning for their consideration in the role.  I feel as a whole the process for employment is very much general and should be more specific.  A candidate is much more than what they have studied or the current employment that they find themselves in.  For example I am versed in Real Estate sales and marketing, but I am very certain that I could fill a role in medical device sales as I only need to understand and learn the product being offered.  I feel my experience hinders recruiters to take me into consideration when I know I would be an asset to any team that took a chance on me."
I would place the job opening on more sites. I woukd also advertise to graduating college students.
"I would only day that providing quicker responses to potential candidates would be appreciated. If moving forward or not, quicker feedback on the status of the process would be great. "
"I would offer the business development and employee engagement style of Liz Ryan. Draw upon the people side of the culture in Johnson and Johnson.

"I would of liked to been notified an
but the status of the recruitment. Just to have known if  the position had been filled or not."
I would not have know about this Job opening unless I had been researching the position. I found out about the job postings through the grapevine and was on the look out for it. Maybe inside talent could be contacted by HR when a Job posting is open in a certain area that they are already working. Allow the inside talent to either fill the position if qualified or be a strong referral source.
"I would make a suggestion that at the end of the process, that applicants have an option to add themselves to an email list that periodically sends out links for similar job openings."
"I would lto see a human individual can contact directly for accurate evaluation with the process instead of a intelligent computer.
Applicant are hired for their true individuality based on knowledge, education and experience a computer can differentiate base on information provided."
I would love to know why my candidacy was not considered for next level.  If something was missing I would want to know.  If I can reapply I would also want to know.
I would love to hear from someone if I am being considered for the job.  
I would love to hear from J&J! I wasn't even sure if my info was received. Thank you for this survey!
I would love to hear back after my application has been submitted.  A simple yes or no to the job that was of interest.
"I would love to have the opportunity to speak with Human Resources representatives in an Open House type setting.  After college, it is difficult to get in front of company recruiters, however, I have skills which would make me an ideal fit for the company but that is difficult to express in an e-mail application process."
I would love to have had an interview for the position. I am extremely qualified and am ready to be a asset for the company! My father has worked for JnJ and has nothing but great things to say about it. I am still available and willing to start whenever for the position and can't wait to hear back from you! 
I would love to have a face to face at J & J to show what I have to offer in IT and be placed on a team. jnaroden@gmail.com
I would love to get updates on the applications I submitted.
"I would love to get more feedback as to why I did not continue in the interview process especially when my experience completely matched the opportunity listed.  Also, I believe (but cannot confirm) that it may be a salary issue but I am fine taking a lower salary to work for a world class company that has an incredible reputation.  "
I would love to get a phone call for an interview.
"I would love to get a feedback on why I could not get the role I applied for. It would give me a clear understanding about where I am falling short for selection criteria.
Also giving the applicants a timeline  on their resume processing time would be really good.

"I would like to see feedback about openings and details on the hiring process, if possible."
"I would like to see a little more consistency in the responsiveness from the hiring manager/recruiter. I know it is a matter of prioirities, but it would be more settling if we heard back about the process of each submission - which stage we made it to or not. I feel like I am burdening the recruiting team by asking what is happening after a lapse of a couple of weeks after submitting an application. Even if they had some sort of idea i.e. we will not get any response either way for either stage (shortlist interview, shortlist hire, hire/not hire, etc) until March 15th, APril 1st, etc. Our applications seem to go into the infamous black hole - even for current employees."

I would like to be able to set up an interview in person.  
I would like to be able to follow up on the application process in order to show my interest in the position. I am unable to find a contact or a way to reach out to the recruiter. 
I would like the result of the application even if I am not selected. At least we will know that the application/resume was reviewed.
"I would like the recruiting process to be more transparent and consistent.  I would like to be informed within a timely manner whether I have even been considered for a position or not and why that is the case (i.e. what skills do I need to illustrate/improve on).

I'm also not sure if it's the discretion of the manager or not--but it seems that some applications require scenario based questions to be answered in additon to basic qualifier inquiries which are in the job descriptions whereas others simply require the qualifications that you possess to be checked off or answered."
I would like the opportunity to speak to someone on the talent acquisition team to enable me to align successfully with an open opportunity.
I would like some kind of feed back as to if my resume has been read.  Simply put if I am not being considered for the position it would be beneficial to hear back from the talent acquisition department.

I would like more feedback on the status of my application. Under review or not qualified...
I would like an update from Talent acquisition since I've interviewed multiple times offered the job but then in both roles that I was offered the position was put on hold and nothing further occurred.  Very disappointing.

I would have liked to know where the current standing was of my application of if I am a qualified candidate. 
I would have liked to have heard something positive or negative about the status of my application and the job. I called the hiring manager today and found out the position was filled. 
"I would have liked to have had a ""human being"" contact me. Other than the auto generated emails I received, I never heard from a talent acquisition colleague despite the fact that I was considered to be a strong fit for the position.

I also have an MBA in marketing from a top (local Dallas) business school program - Southern Methodist University. I am well versed in developing and delivering multimedia presentations to diverse audiences, including C-Suite and Director-level healthcare decision makers. Moreover, I am familiar with (and was credentialed in) several of the hospitals in the sales territory. 

And yet, with all of these professional and academic accomplishments, I was not even given an initial phone screening with someone from HR, much less the opportunity to discuss how I could be a valued resource to the sales team or the targeted clients with a manager. "
I would have like to heard back on my application in a timely manner.
I would have like to have received notification that the job was filled. 
I would have appreciated a phone call from a recruiter or someone in HR. I don't feel that I had the opportunity to show your company why I'm the best fit for the position.

I however was taken out of consideration before even getting a chance to have a phone screening with HR.  I'm very puzzled as to why my application would have been rejected at such an early stage so I really cannot comment too favorably on recruiting process in my experience.  I was applying for a position with the same title as my current title for a similar company in a similar industry.  The only reason I'm looking for work is my current employer is closing down the office where I am located.

I work for J&J before and 
"I wonder if these surveys are deployed consistently? For example, I received a survey after I had been rejected once; however, this time I have not heard anything about the status of my submission.

Nonetheless, thank you for the effort. "
"I wish you could go past the screening process and really get to talk to some one who really can hear more about your skills and what you can offer.

Most companies I ask this question to reply that they appreciate Postdoc experience, or to get experience in industry with a small spin-of company (as they are more approachable since they don't have the funds for recruiters). 

Unlike in academia (where each research group is visible), I found it hard to find anything about the specific research groups. This made it a lot harder to imagine if I were a suitable candidate, which I found a shame because I believe I have a lot to offer. "
"I wish the recruiter knows more about technical information, to decide whether my skills -which might not be exactly written like the job description, but have a lot to do with the job description-  are relevant for the job or not.  

I have the impression that skills that are very close to the job description, are ignored because the recruiter do not see the technical connection between the skills and the requisition, just because they are not exactly written with the same words."
"I wish that there were a way to get any type of feedback, but I understand the legal ramifications.  If one were good enough to be identified as a potential employee for a role, then perhaps more broadly speaking a person is a general fit for the organization.  Once a high caliber candidate is identified, perhaps it would be good to shop her/him around multiple hiring managers to explore other potential fits.  One of the attractive benefits of JnJ is the career/personal development aspect.  This potential for internal movement/development lowers the risk in exploring adjacent opportunities."
"I wish that salary range was listed, and that understanding that J&J requires chronological resumes over functional resumes would have gotten me in the door for a chat sooner. I've applied to similar positions before, and I never understand why I never hear back or at least have a phone interview when I meet all or most of the job requirements. "
I wish that Johnson and Johnson called me for an interview.
"I wish that Johnson & Johnson would hire me because I know I would bring in revenue to the company, I am an extremely hard working, I might not have gone to college but I prefer to be taught the job on site with the company itself. I am very reliable and dependent, every job I have ever had I gave it 110% and did nothing but make the company money. I am deeply upset with myself that I did not get this position. But, best of luck to you Johnson & Johnson. You are a very well known and fantastic company. Thank you"
I wish recruitment team would call me to see where I am in the application process and at least text me if I did not qualify or if there's interest.  It feels like resume is lost in thin air..which is frustrating.
I wish new developments such as next steps in the interview process or if I am not being considered were communicated quicker.
I wish I was selected. Thank you!
I wish I could see where my application is at.
I wish I could have been notified that I was or was not in consideration for the role.
"I will tell you, I have applied several times at Johnson & Johnson for positions in the Raleigh-Durham NC area. I am certainly qualified, as I held a successful career with McKesson Medical-Surgical for 10 years, and while I am happy with your submission process, I am disappointed that I have never been contacted for a face to face interview. I still feel I will be a great fit with Johnson & Johnson, all I would like is the chance to interview. 
Humbly yours,

I will recommend to take in consideration the experience of the candidate before make a decision. 
I will be able to answer this more truthfully when the process is complete
"I went thru a round of interviews before in 2014. I had a great experience with every individual or panel interview. Very thorough, respectful, fair process. I didnt get opportunity to hear what went wrong although I acnowledge in part, I wasnt ready to make the transition from one job to another. I have since left P&G and relocated back to Cincinnati from Caracas, Venezuela"
"I wasn't put forward in the process for an interview at this time,but that would not discourage me from applying for future positions."
"I wasn't interviewed for this position. I received an email stating that you were looking for someone that better matched the job description.  

It would have been nice if someone had called me to discuss why I was interested in the role. "
I wasn't informed of the outcome. I assume because I haven't heard and I'm being asked to complete this survey that I wasn't shortlisted. 
"I wasn't contacted by a recruiter yet, but I received this survey - I am unsure of the process steps. 

I believe I have the skills, background and talent to succeed at this role and add value to the Johnson and Johnson organization.

I look forward to hearing back from your company.

Thank you!"
I was well pleased with the process. Well done. 
I was very satisfied from the explanation of the job description and I think there is a very good system for applying. 
I was VERY pleased with the communication. Everyone involved was so kind and followed up nicely
I was very pleased with my experience in applying for career opportunities within the organization.  Thank You! 
"I was very impressed with the whole process, within minutes I had an email back from your company and the next day I received a request to set up a call.

Great process and team!  This is one of many reasons I hope to join the J & J family."
I was very impressed with the interview process including all of the leadership team and employees that I came in contact with. 
I was very impressed with system.  Very straightforward.
"I was very impressed how quickly the recruiter for this role (Philip Moses) reached out to me to set up time. During our conversation, he said he would be passing my resume to the hiring manager and that I should be hearing back from her.  When I did not hear back, I followed up with Philip a few times.  Unfortunately, never heard back. Would be great if at least he closed the loop and got back to me with whatever message he had.  Does not take a lot of time, but leaves a long lasting impression. Thanks!"
"I was very happy with the process!!! Plus the survey was added as I feel this is very important!

Thank you

"I was very excited about the opportunity and believed that after the three interviews, my skills fit the role incredibly well. The job required a Bachelor's degree or equivalent experience, and I possess 15 years experience in pharma and 8 years of experience that perfectly matched the role. Yet, at the final stage of the interview process, J & J would not consider me because I didn't have the degree. I feel like you missed out on a great candidate, who had the backing and support of 3 current employees, yet you didn't allow me to interview. I think that having the conversation before making the decision would have been a better approach, and that you should at least consider equivalent, real world experience if you really want to improve your process. "
"I was very disappointed about not getting an interview. My skills and experience would have made a perfect fit to the position. Also, posting should have been removed when all positions were filled."
I was unclear of the job description and duties. My first thoughts were this could be a start up sales group. There were several opening in similar regions of the state. That could be the case. I am interested in the need for weekend travel. This makes me think displays and events. 
"I was unable to reset my password with a previous login, so had to create a new one this time around.    If the ""forgot password"" link worked it would be better.  :)"
"I was Trying Real Hard to get an Interview Even though I summited my application same time or even before a Co-Worker of mine .Even after 22 years exactly this same work experience .It's hard for me to understand why I didn't get an interview .Not sure -What J and J is looking for ? I had two inside  maintenance guy's as references there,  but still didn't even interview . I am sure J and J is a great company ,but don't understand the lack of studying talent or what is needed for your position -Two actual Co-Workers we're hired and Maybe an inside person is showing strong bias inside, but  I should have had an interview ,but I didn't even get an interview .I don't understand . I am sure still a Great Place to Work .Thanks Phil Handy ."
I was told the job was posted but couldn't find it on the J & J career site.  It wasn't listed on Indeed but eventually found it and posted on LinkedIn.  
"I was told that I was going to be passed to the 2nd round interview process 2 weeks ago, but no one has contacted me.  You should always close the loop no matter what as this positively shows that your brand cares about people "
"I was told i was not moving forward because of confidential reasons and not given any feedback at all.  I had previously done the role on a maternity leave and was very successful at it.  Not being given any information on why i was not successful in moving forward was very frustrating and somewhat unprofessional in my opinion.

"I was surprised when my application got turned down. I have all the requirements and the desire for the position.
More surprising is the fact that I have been reached by more than 10 recruiters representing staffing agencies for this same position assuring me that I am the right fit.
Is there a disconnect between your hiring team and those agencies or I was never chosen by your resume screening software?
I still think I am a good candidate even thou this job is just a contract.
Hope next time it is a real person the one that looks at my high potential."
I was surprised to not be contacted or even phone screened for the role considering my experience and employment history at GE Healthcare and Siemens Healthineers.
I was shocked how simple and straightforward the application process was.  It was by far the easiest online application process I've seen.  
"I was sent a refusal letter in less than 24hrs - a more specific explanation for decline would be appreciated. Such as skills vs requirements of the position, my location with regard to territory or compensation requirements don't align. 
Thank you!"
I was satisfied. Thank you!
I was satisfied with the process.  I appreciated the emails informing me of the process.

I was referred by Adi Prabowo to Johnson & Johnson organization. It would be great if it could be seamless process.
"I was referred by a long time employee. I initially applied in September and after not hearing anything for 5 months I saw the position I had applies for reopened. I contactes an HR member and she told me to reapply. I was told I would hear something back in 2 weeks, and it has been a little over 3 weeks since my second time applying. I really would love working here, my father-in-law has been at the Lititz plant for over 20 years. I do not want to seem too pushy by sending emails every week as I do not want to give up this very rare opportunity to work here.

I was referred by a current JNJ employee and received an email with a link to complete the referral process. However the link did not work and I was unable to proceed with the referral process. I sent multiple requests for help through the JNJ careers website and have yet to hear back. I am highly interested in being a part of the JNJ team and I would greatly appreciate it if you could help me resolve this issue!
"I was referred by a colleague / friend after I applied for a position. Instead of being able to match my application with my referral, I had to apply again. This seems silly..."
"I was recommended by my spouse who works at J & J and was invited to apply through an online portal. I found the application process smooth and easy. The questions asked about the candidate's expertise, experience and skills are very pertinent and not only would they be extremely helpful to the HR Department in picking the right person but were also helpful to me as a candidate as I was clearly able to see what was required to fill the role."
I was qualified for the job just wondering why I never heard back from anyone.
"I was pretty much interested in joining J&J, but the interview process was stretched for more than a month.
I couldn't let go of other opportunities that came with a confirmation, so I had to withdraw from the interview process at J&J as i couldn't wait any longer."
I was pleased with the straight forward and ease to applying to my job interest on line. 
"I was pleasantly surprised to receive a note to tell me I was not to be considered.  

It was easy to apply"
"I was not selected to have a conversation.   Maybe it is just my personality, but i have always prospered moving into new areas...from selling SaaS with a tax and legal focus, to Information Governance  Professional Services for the entire organization, and then on to Cloud/Managed Services/Hardware/Software , Analytics, and Public Safety.

The ability to influence and move to action/revenue are skills independent from the frankly easy to learn things like pharma and medical devices.  

I believe you would be well served having a fresh perspective and breaking away from teh usual suspects that are hired in a sales capacity."
I was not selected for the position. I would suggest you to provide feedback to the 'rejected' candidates.Thanks.
"I was not recruited for this position. However, I am actively seeking this 'type' of opportunity and found the job posting by searching on several websites. 

I do not feel that 'this opportunity' was difficult to find. So, I cannot offer constructive suggestions to improve advertisements or recruitment processes."
"I was not overly thrilled with the offer conveyance process.  During the initial interview, the recruiter specificaly asked me what my expectation of base salary would be for the role; after I told her what I was looking for, I specifically asked her if that is what the role would pay, and she replied yes.

When the offer was officially communicated to me, the base salary was less than the amount originally discussed with the original recruiter.  When I told her that there was a discrepancy, she only replied with, ""well the other recruiter is new"".  Furthermore, she then told me the offer was non negotiable.  I then asked to meet in the middle between what was originally communicated to me and what the offer was... She then proceeded to ask me what that number was and how she could make me happy.  I then told her what the middle number was, and she again reiterated that she wouldn't negotiate - this made no sense to me considering she was the one who perpetuated the conversation surrounding how she could ""meet me in the middle"".

She generally was very aggressive in her tone and wasn't really open to answering questions or responding to requests.  For example, I asked her to document my desire for a stand up workstation (email documentation was fine) and she refused, even when I stated that it was for health reasons.  She then said she was ask the hiring manager, which was all that I was asking for, and then reiterated her refusal to document this request anywhere.

I then asked her if there was any HR restriction from me going to directly to the hiring manager to let her know I would be accepting the offer, and she reacted in an incredibly condescending way, responding with ""why wouldn't you be able to, and I don't understand why you are asking this question"".  I told her that I was simply trying to do the right thing in the right manner and wanted to ensure I wasn't breaking any rules, and again she replied in a condescending manner.

Overall, the HR staff member that communicated my offer to me, made what was supposed to be a very positive and happy conversation, and instead left a bad taste in my mouth.  

I am excited to start my next role, but I would suggest that both HR members be coached so other JnJ staff members are not treated in the same way that I have been."
"I was not notified on my status of acceptance or denial for this position until today, verbally by my current supervisor.  I have received no notification from the hiring manager or recruiter on my status for this position."
I was not interviewed.
I was not contacted for an interview but I will continue to apply.  I strongly believe my rich skills and experience as well as strong work ethic will be great assets to your company.  I hope recruitment will be able to review my qualifications and arrive at the same conclusion.  Thank you for your good work!
"I was not contacted either way about this position, but then received a satisfaction survey.  It would be nice to know if I was considered, because I felt like it was an exceptional fit. "
"I was not contacted by J&J and it is clear to me if the positions I applied for have been already fulfilled or not. I see a strong fit in many of the roles I applied for in the past and I'm convinced that I could contribute incredibly to J&J. For some reason, I never received one message in return and wonder if these positions are really open to external candidates. I am open to be contacted by J&J by email if more information about my experience is required/ can improve the recruiting/talent management process. Guilherme.a.iwamoto@gmail.com"
"I was not contacted about this job after I applied. I wish there was more transparency and courtesy expressed to those who applied, whether they end up getting selected for an interview or not."
I was not aware that since I already had a login into your system my resume would just be forwarded on when I submitted for the job. I thought I would be able to review what I was submitting before it was sent.

I was never interviewed and was never explained the reason for not been interviewed.
I was never contacted to be considered for the position. Not sure why... 
I was never contacted that I did or did not get an interview
"I was never contacted in regards to
This position "
"I was never contacted for this role.  After the initial email thanking me for my application, there was no communication on whether or not I was still being considered for the position. "
"I was never contacted for an interview so I am not sure why I even received this email.  I was contacted by a recruiter to apply for this job and I did and never heard anything until this email came today about taking a survey.

In my opinion it is a waste of time to send send emails to potential candidates that have not even had a phone screen."
I was never contacted for an interview nor did I receive a rejection letter . It seemed unusual to receive this survey as the first followup to my application.I will continue to look for other positions with your organization. 
I was never contacted about the position and will never consider Johnson & Johnson in the future.
"I was never contact in regards to my application, whether the company was passing or moving me along"
I was never contact by anyone about the position. I never had the chance to speak with anyone about the position. I never received an interview for the position. I was never given any feedback as to why qualifications were not a match. I did not receive any areas to include in my development plan as a J&J employee to strengthen my skills if I was not a fit for the position. I would like to compare my experience with the person who got the position.
I was never called or interviewed so looking forward to learn more about their recruitment process and the Company.
"I was impressed with the quick progression of the recruiting process. In my conversations with various team members, I found congruency and follow through. I particularly liked that I received a gift bag of J & J product samples at the end of my interview; it was a small, but very thoughtful detail. Overall, I appreciated the warm, relaxed atmosphere of the Tampa work space and the friendly reception from the staff.  "
I was highly qualified for this position however no reason was provided as to why I was not concerned for the position.
I was happy with the recruitment process.
"I was happy to receive the survey but I did not receive any other communications that I was not selected for an interview, so I assume the role has already been filled but it is a bit unclear?"
I was happy to receive notification of application acceptance. Im hoping to be kept informed of the application status as it moves through the process
I was excluded from the selection process without even knowing the reason behind it. I wish I had feedback considering what I could improve to achieve J & J's level of excellence.
"I was excited to read that Johnson and Johnson acquired Vogue International as they are such a quality company. Based on my experience, I am satisfied with the recruitment process.

I was disappointed that I was not even given the chance to interview. I was an internal referral and was recommended by the former representative. 
"I was disappointed and turned down the offer because the opportunity that was presented to me before the interview by the recruiter was initially a 2 year contract and johnson and johnson benefits. 

When the job was offered to me it changed from a 2 year contract to the contract being through the end of the 2017 year and benefits through the temp agency. Around the holidays is the worst time to be unemployed because companies are normally slow and not hiring. Also, the pay not being negotiable to $5 more per hour in lieu of the extreme changes to the contract was another final deciding factor. 

I would love to someday work for a great company such as Johnson & Johnson, I hope another opportunity presents itself where the offer and terms don't change at the last minute."
"I was considered for two positions – Maintenance Engineer and Automation Engineer. I declined the Maintenance Engineer position because I truly wanted the Automation Engineer position.  I never received a phone interview for the Automation Engineer position, as I was considered “Unqualified” by the HR person, which I believe I am very qualified.  The reason the unqualified designation was given stemmed from me not checking an online box that I probably should have checked. I only realized this after discussing my qualifications status with the HR person interviewing me for the Maintenance Engineer’s position.  I didn’t check the online box because I felt I was missing the documentation responsibility side of the IQ, OQ, & PQ part of the question, even though I perform these functions for every machine installation at Herr’s, it’s just not formalized as it is at J&J.  Even though I believe the online checkbox part of the application can filter unqualified engineers, I felt there were too many responsibilities rolled up into one checkbox question.  In other words, break the responsibilities into more checkboxes to clearly identify an applicant’s weakness. 
I do appreciate the consideration for the Maintenance Engineer’s position.

I was completely satisfied with the process
I was completely qualified and would have appreciated a chance to interview.
"I was asked whether I will require sponsorship now or in the future for the role. I am a Canadian currently living in Boston and I was unclear whether the TN visa fell under this category as it requires no direct sponsorship by the company. A clarifying sentence would be helpful. With this exception, the application process was straight forward!"
I was an internal employee referral from a DM and I did not even get a phone call or email from HR on 3 different opportunities in my area. I use to be a recruiter and remember really heavily on internal referrals to grow my business and expand my talent pool and with that being said it made this a VERY disappointing experience.
"I was an excellent fit with this position and was given an internal recommendation by a J&J employee. Why wasn't I given any feedback on why I was not considered?

"I was a little surprised to take a survey about the recruitment process as the first step of the recruitment process, after applying to a position. The questions were relevant to the application process though.  Looking forward to hearing back. "
I was a little disappointed in the process as I did apply and had all relevant skills with the exception of Oncology experience. I was surprised I was not even called for an HR screening. I would be interested in learning about other roles as they arise.
"I wanted to upload another document as well as a resume and I didn't see the opportunity to do that. I was hoping that document could give the flight department more incite into my experience.

I want to hear the notice even if I was not selected as a interview candidate. 
I want to hear the decision or feedback even if rejected.
I want to have a chance to interview with your recruiter.
"I use to love the idea of working at Johnson & Johnson, but I did not realize how discriminatory they were as a company. 

I am attractive, older (50's), in great shape, professional, educated with a Bachelor's degree, and a portfolio of my work, yet after 100 submissions, this company has not hired me.  

In my 20s, 30's and even 40's, I had no issue finding jobs, but it is obvious how discriminating this company is.  My friend who is an Epidemiologist said the same thing after apply for a job.  

I run circles around some of the assistants, and I can do so much more to benefit the company.

Stop discriminating against older workers. They are more reliable, and much more up to date as I am on technology, moreso, than most of the assistants, so why are you not hiring healthy older people?  "
"I understand the need to sort through multiple applicants in a standardized process.  However, I believe that in such unique positions around emerging technologies that there is a lot that doesn't translate well in a limited template.  I trust that were we able to have a dialogue around the position and my capabilities, that we'd still be talking, progressing towards a mutually beneficial outcome"
I understand the need for feedback but asking candidates who were turned down for an opportunity with J&J and then asking them (several times) to complete a survey on your recruitment process is a bit much.
"I understand the difficulties (time and the need for some discretion on the part of the company) but more transparency is always appreciated. For example, perhaps there could be an indication on the hiring website of where you are in the hiring process. What would be great as a candidate would be to get some feedback about why if not selected. This could be driven by candidate enquiry. Also there may be suggestions from the recruiter / HR about other roles at J&J where there may be a better fit if appropriate. "
I understand the amount of recruits that you must get because of the credibility of Johnson & Johnson but there has to be a human side of selection. I not only would look for the correct skill set for the position but also the type of person I want in my organization.I feel that I can offer both.
"I understand the amount of people who apply for these roles can be stressful, any type of communication is a more engaging process than none.  Thank you. "
"I understand that you receive many applications and cannot respond in detail to each one, but I had hoped to receive something more than a swift impersonal form letter of rejection."
"I understand that the recruitment process of the company is done through a series of interviews that the candidate must go through, but also that ""doing the same always, will always give the same results"", so it is important to improve the recruitment processes because the interviews limit the candidate either by nerves or become imprecise, some proposals to do so are the following:

- opinions of bosses or co-workers
- determine the candidate's emotional level
- Invite the applicant to take part in a day of work within the organization
- Investigate the personal life of the applicant."
"I understand that the initial screening is typically done utilizing a keyword search of the submitted documentation.  It would also be useful for the Recruiting and Hiring Managers to do a quick scan of the resumes submitted, since they may discover a good potential match based on the resume content, and the candidate's experiential credentials."
"I understand that Johnson & Johnson have many applicants applying everyday; therefore, I am sure that it may take some time to respond back to each applicant updating them on the hiring process."
"I understand that is not possible to inform all applicants regarding the reasons behind employment decisions, however it would be nice to have a response for highly qualified applicants who fulfill all the listed criteria, but are not selected. "
"I understand that given the amount of submissions J&J receives per job posting, it may not have the bandwidth to get back to all applicants. However, it would be a nice personal touch and a way to close the loop to confirm whether or not a candidate is being considered for a role."
"I understand recruitment process is extensive, but if some detailed information on hiring status is provided that can be useful to candidates

Pragnesh Patel"
"I understand job openings are posted even if the position is already filled which is confusing. I have been a contractor for your firm since 2007 and have liked the colleagues that I met and worked for.If another position which would fit my skills and abilities becomes available, please contact me."
I understand it is very clear. Of course it would be good to know the current satay is of the process.
I understand is clear and detailed.
I understand everyone is using computer technology to Job Scan applications but since I absolutely match the job requirements posted and have 5+ years of related supply chain experience. I would have appreciated a human touch on this shortlisting/ recruitment  process.
"I understand a very large organization has many different complex processes, however, reducing the amount of time that lapses after one applies online and or providing a useful way in which candidates receive updates to the hiring status I believe would be helpful. 

Time is a critical factor and can make a significant difference in obtaining strong individuals with respect to available opportunities within the organization.

"I understand a company such as J & J would be receiving a ton of profiles. I already have a favorable opinion in my mind about J & J, however two things would stand out
1. A proper follow up after the application is received
2. If Hiring manager name / contact is mentioned atleast at the end of the application would do good to both the applicant and J & J.

One item that would help in listing the requirements is to provide a list of problems / challenges faced by the group looking to hire.

I truly would have love to have had an  opportunity to at least interview. Best wishes to the company and patients.
"I truly wish companies had a way to follow up once an application is submitted.  I feel that meeting someone in person, even a phone call, gives a more accurate feel for a person.  There is a lot of information that I would like to convey that just doesn't fit on a resume or standard application questions."
"I truly feel Johnson & Johnson is an exceptional company, and at present time no improvement is required for your recruitment process.

"I tried to follow up with HR department regarding my application, I couldn't reach a specific department or representative. Overall, application process was great, great interface. "
I totally approve of your recruiting process. A telephonic conversation may be a suggestion.
I took the time to interview during the initial phone Screening and my experience with the recruiter was extremely negative. She did not explain the timeline of making a decision or the next steps. I took hours to prepare a portfolio and also for the interview. Post interview I followed up twice with the recruiter and she did not even had the decency to respond back. The process made me feel extremely undervalued and wasted my time. 
"I thought this process was very easy, straight forward, and intruiging. I don't see the need to change the process. "
I thought the talent acquisition process was quite clear and easy to understand. 
"I thought the recruitment process was straightforward and the job was very easy to apply for on the web portal.  Sending updates on the status of an application to an applicant periodically would keep applicants informed and would let them know whether or not they are being considered, etc.  "
I thought the recruitment process was great! Hopefully I will have the opportunity to work for such a great company one day!
"I thought the process was very straightforward, and I appreciated the clear discussions of the process with the recruitment team.  In cases where next steps went beyond the initial timeline I was given, I heard back via email to give me a revised update, which was very helpful.  Overall I was pleased.

There were quite a few positions available during the interview, but it was hard to write down all the potential options beyond the three I expected to interview for.  I'm not sure if it is allowed, but it would be helpful to provide a short summary of the positions that we were asked to rank on 1 page for us to leave with, in case another position is available that you are interested in."
I thought the process was very smooth and organized
I thought the process was very simple and very good so I don't really have anything negative to say
"I thought the process was very easy and user friendly. The suggestion I have is having the program that creates a profile, be able to sync more with what has already been done. I felt I had to be very care to not repeat upload information for updating my profile after I had submitted an application for job posting. I hope this is helpful!"
I thought the process was thorough and answered all my questions.  Thanks for the opportunity!
"I thought the process was streamlined, fast and easy to follow.  I appreciate the efforts and follow up to ask for constructive comments.  Another reason now why I am interested in working for Johnson & Johnson!  "
I thought the process was smooth and easy to follow. If I have the opportunity to work with J&J I hope to learn those lessons first hand.

I thought the process was fine.  The job description was detail and insight for a candidate to make decision on applying.
I thought the process was excellent.  The progression of information entry was logical and very thorough.
I thought the process was easy and efficient. 
"I thought the process was clear, concise and user friendly.

I thought the online application process was quite simple but I haven't heard back yet of the status of my resume submission. I'm not sure if there is a timeline for that but I'm anxiously waiting for a reply.
I thought the online application process was quick and intuitive. It was a pleasant process. 
I thought the job description was very clear including geography which is often not very clear with other companies.
"I thought the confirmation e-mail was very informative with respect to the process and how you can change your profile or update information.  When positions are filled, it would be helpful for applicants to receive an e-mail notification, so they'll know if it is or is not still an active opportunity. 

Thank you for the opportunity to give feedback!"
I thought the application process went smoothly. I really appreciate the detail spent on the web site lay out as far as the application process and what to expect. I think you have done a great job getting people excited about working at Johnson and Johnson.
I thought the application process was straight forward and simple.
I thought the application process was simple and effective. I still have not heard if I am being considered for the position or not. Better communication would be helpful. 
I thought the application process was clear and easy to use.  I appreciate uploading the resume and cover letter rather than copy and paste.  
I thought that the response time was good regarding this particular position. I would like to have a better understanding of specifics on how I did not meet the skill set requirements for the position.
I thought that the application process was very easy and intuitive.  The application design and process is much better than most of the other companies that I have applied to through their website.
"I thought that Johnson and Johnson's recruitment process was intuitive and easy to find. I do not have any current suggestions for improvement, but will let someone know if something comes to mind. "
"I thought that I was denied rather quickly without an opportunity to speak with anyone.  I know I am changing industries, but I bring a vast amount of people management and organizational leadership experience that I would have liked to share with someone with an opportunity to gain a position."
"I thought my background and experience level was a great fit, but I did not get an opportunity for an interview. I would have greatly appreciated some kind of feedback as to what other skills or experiences the recruiters were looking for so I could develop myself for future opportunities."
"I thought it was very efficient, there was good communication throughout. "
I thought it was one of the more straight forward of all that I have ever filled out.  If I were to change anything I would have the resume and cover letter downloads together
I thought it was great. 
I thought it was above average so I can't think of anything at this time.
"I thought for a large organization who receives a large amount of applications, the process was fairly easy and pleasant. "
I thought everything was very streamlined and easy to follow. I did not see anything that seemingly needed improvement 
"I though it was very clear, direct, and efficient. "
"I think, it is important to provide feedback on the reasons why a candidate was not even considered to participate in the recruitment process, specially when the candidate´s profile match with the open position."
"I think, attaching a test  in the application about the  skills needed for the position could help in the selection of the candidate. "
"I think your recruitment website works well, and takes a minimal amount of time for the application process.  It appears smoother than the last time I used it a few years ago."
I think your recruitment process is very convenient and detail so I have no idea of improving the recruitment process.
"I think your organization takes an extremely long time to review candidates and have not realized ""people are more than just a resume."" Despite have over 2 decade of work experience in Life Sciences, IT, and others, I was not been considered nor granted an interview for any position applied for. This leaves me feeling as if J&J has certain biases that may have guided your HR team in ways to side step certain rules that apply to race, gender, ethnicity,and age, and the reason why I do not view J&J favorably. "
"I think you're recruitment process is quite limiting. By solely focusing in a candidate's specific experience (particularly with relation to your industry), rather than a candidate's potential and capacity, J&J might be missing out in surprisingly good candidates."
I think you're doing very well. Your company is globally known and requires no further explanation.
"I think you should have more questions on the application for the particular posting.  I feel confident in my ability to answer questions pertaining to my value for the role(s) that I am applying and it would point out potential candidates who can also back their experience
 in their resumes."
I think you have a pretty good process. 
I think you are doing very well. 
"i think you are doing good, i can't fine any difficulties in recruitment process."
"I think you are doing fine. The algorithm didn't work well for populating fields from the resume, that is ok.  Minor changes to edit.

take care
mark"
I think you are doing a good job.
I think y'all have been doing a very good job so far. Hope y'all can keep it up!
"I think with organic improvement linked to best practices, your current recruitment practices are spot on. What might be helpful is a bit more openness to applicants, such as myself, who have, over the years applied so many times, but continue to be rejected, notwithstanding my complete fit, experientially and educationally, with all of the positions I have applied to"
I think we should go back to an interview instead of having a computer decide who fits a role. I have 15 years of buying experience globally and cannot get an interview with Johnson and Johnson even as a maintenance person.  The system doesn't work and you are missing high quality people due to a computer saying if you see my resume or not.  Its very disheartening .
I think we need more recruiters so they can invest more time in reviewing great candidates.  I believe they have other responsibilities that splits their time from what I believe is their #1 priority.
"i think video conference will be good  , to know more about the person"
"I think this survey should be conducted after the selection process has been completed.  I only submitted my application three working days ago and do not know the status other than received, so to confirm the role description as accurate may prove different if this applicant were to get an interview and ask more questions about the position.  "
I think this process seems similar to other companies. I think updates noting that a person is still being considered or that an organization is still looking would be a nice touch. As a professional seeking employment often times the worry is that you've been lost in the shuffle. However with there likely being hundred of applicants applying for positions that may not be realistic. 
I think this process is perfect.
"I think this is the first time a company has shown such sincerity to take feedback on the recruitment process, I think the process was really fluid, one quick thing can be done is, update on the process of application if that can be automated it would be great ."
I think this has been a very fair recruitment process.
"I think this has been a pretty good process so far, if I am not chosen maybe just an explanation for why I wasn't qualified.  Otherwise everything has been great so far!"
I think this employer doesnt need to improve the recruitment process
I think they should speed up the process
"i think they should have a live chat on their page wgere applicants can ask about things that they need to clarify or things they they didn't understand while filling up the application form which might have result to false or data. however, that will consume time and would cost you money for the new system and also manpower who will operate the live chat 24/7, maybe you should just change or enhance thr composition of the wordings and sentences that for sure will be understood by any applicants. thanks"
I think they are doing a good job
"I think there should be some degree of respect for the applicants.
Eventhough the talent acquisition group is very busy recruiting personnel, it is important to inform the applicants if they were not selected. After all, we all have been on this side of the fence!!!!"
I think there could have been more interaction via phone. Get to know the recruiter a little more and ask questions. 
I think the website is very user friendly. No suggestions here
"I think the vetting process electronically is super antiquated. Meritocracy is based only wow resumes, so you are vetting the best people judged solely on a format that is so staged. Really, is J&J choosing the best candidates or just collecting resumes? Instead ask questions to allow us to demonstrate we can be a subject expert in the role.  Alternatively, give every applicant a task assignment to complete so you can competently make equitable comparisons in finding truly the best person who can deliver results. The intangibles are what make great candidates!  The fact that you are asking me to do this survey, I think that you also recognize that shortfalls exist under the current system. Please consider my feedback in earnest. Best regards, Gideon Saroufiem (Brooklyn, NY) 646 283 1869"
I think the recruitment process works very well and very efficient.
I think the recruitment process with J & J is great.  Thank you for allowing to do this survey.
I think the recruitment process was very good for the most part. It was odd to receive this survey 1 month after I applied.  I still have not heard a positive or negative response about the application that I submitted. I hope this helps!
I think the recruitment process was organized.
"I think the recruitment process was easy to follow and I received a response back immediately, which I truly appreciate.  "
I think the recruitment process thus far has been great. I thought I would hear from talent acquisition a little sooner but I have no complaints.
"I think the recruitment process that Johnson & Johnson has in place is good and in standard to what is being used in the industry currently. Response times were good. 
The one thing I think everyone is missing is the personal aspect. I think the more you know about someone on a personal level, the better the employee you'll get."
I think the recruitment process one of the good ones I came across.
I think the recruitment process is flawless.  
I think the recruitment process has been wonderful. I've only completed the application process. I have not spoken with a recruiter in person. Thank you for the survey!
I think the recruitment process for Johnson & Johnson is sufficient and very thorough. Positions are easy to locate on the internet and the application process is not cumbersome. Overall I think Johnson & Johnson does a great job with its recruitment process. 
I think the process would be better if Johnson & Johnson could somehow give the applicant ways to improve or suggestions in the event they aren't selected for the position. 
I think the process works pretty well. 
I think the process was very easy to follow and that it should remain the same.
I think the process was very easy and the website was set up very nice. Great user experience. 
I think the process was straightforward and clear.  I don't have any suggestions for improvement at this time.
I think the process was smooth. All the relevant information was available to complete the application as well as you could upload a resume and cover letter. Also I liked that the required skill sets were included as part of the job requirements.
I think the process was easy and straightforward.
I think the process is very good and fast from the talent staff position but became a little low when the candidates are recommended to the hiring manager or site.
I think the process is very functional.  
I think the process is very clear and easy to go through - I can't recall nothing that can be improved :)
"I think the process is suitable.  
"
I think the process is quite simple and easy to understand. 
I think the process is great! It is much easier than other sites and can really help a person see if the role is for them or not. Now I just hope I get selected as one of the candidates! 
"I think the process is good, feedback at regular intervals to let the candidate know where they are in the process.  once an application is submitted there is no communication other than a courteous acknowledgement the resume has been received.   "
I think the overall process was very intuitive with very detailed job descriptions. 
"I think the overall application process is fair.  I would like to see Johnson & Johnson give people with less job experience but extensive education a chance.  I think they should at least get a face to face interview to see if personality, work ethics and knowledge are worthy of a opportunity for employment. "
I think the online recruitment process has been a  breeze and I wouldn't change a thing. The turn around time for response can be mentioned in the future and also giving a path to send reminders at the start of the process. 
I think the job post was very clear and it is easy to apply
I think the first screening without an interview delete a very good potential candidates with others skills not measurable in an electronic system.  
"I think the feedback process is an efficient one. I did not get an interview but I am appreciative to be informed as such. 

Very often it takes meeting a candidate face to face to have a good read; body language is an important part of communication. Screening out candidates based on proforma CV can probably eliminate 95 percent of undesired results, there should be those on the ""borderline"" which perhaps may be excellent candidates when an interview is conducted.

I am not giving this feedback due to rejection; I am just speaking from experience and pleased with the overal recruitment process

Thanks and best regards"
"I think the emails that introduce new openings are great. Including tips for working at J&J, what to expect should you be so lucky to move on in the interview process, and some common Q&A articles would be excellent. Any opportunity to meet a manager or recruiter face to face, not them just knowing you on paper is also a great selling tool for the applicant. 
Great Survey!"
I think the current process is extremely easy to use and very intuitive. The only thing that I think would make the experience better would be a confirmation of received application and resume and then a number or email address to follow up with. 
I think the company has a good job search method in the media.
I think the application/recruitment process is fine. This was one of a few companies I applies for employment through LinkedIn. 
I think the application submission process was very smooth.  One of the things that would help in the job description where in the organization this job fits and what are the possible career path for this role
"I think the application process was seamless.  Once the application process is completed it would be nice to be able to speak with someone regarding the position.  Although I may not be the traditional applicant for this position, I definitely possess the skills and experience to excel in HR Leader position."
I think the application process was easy and self explanatory.  
"I think the application process was clear, concise and easy. I can't think of any way it needs to improve. "
I think the actual process was great. I'm a little confused as to why I'm taking this survey before even hearing back about the position I applied for... does this mean I didn't advance in the process? 
I think the ability to search for an apply for roles within Johnson and Johnson is great.  My biggest suggestion for improvement is a little more communication on where the process stands.  I realize some of these positions can take a while but maybe providing a realistic timeline of how things will proceed with the automated email that acknowledged my submission. 
"I think the ""front end"" process of applying is very easy and intuitive - thank you. I hope that the follow through part of the process is an equally positive experience. I really hope I have the opportunity to interview for the role as I think my skills and experience are a great fit! But at the very minimum, I hope that some communication will be sent to me whether or not I am asked to take the next step for a further screening, phone interview and/or in person meeting. It is a good professional practice to let candidates know the position was filled or you are not exactly what we were looking for, etc. There is nothing worse than taking the time to prepare a thoughtful cover letter and resume and feeling like your efforts went into the ""black hole."" I am a seasoned professional who is currently employed. I saw this opportunity as just that - an opportunity to be at a high growth, mission-oriented company who is always rated very highly as best places to work. I hope this feedback is helpful - thanks for the opportunity to provide it."
I think that you're doing an excellent job.
"I think that would be terrific to provide visibility of the selection process status, it would be something as simple as to share the due date for closing the process, so I as candidate could deduce the results of my application.
Thanks for asking!
ar"
"I think that with todays technology and ability for people to advance themselves with education online, that you could give recruits the ability to show themselves via video.  

As someone that excels at what they call Emotional Intelligence, it is hard to convey everything you can do for employees and client engagement via a resume.  

I would recommend that you give recruits who may not have all the skills, but would be willing to PAY for the opportunity for an interview.  Someone like me would jump at that chance to prove themselves face to face.  This is something I have been thinking about for some time.

Warm Regards
Chris Mattice"
I think that when the candidates are applying is very important to be informed about the process of selection and a little feed back as well. This way the candidates could be improve their respective weaknesses for a new opportunity 
"I think that the recruitment process, which involves several steps, gives both the candidate and Johnson and Johnson time and opportunity for exploration and assessment. I went through four steps so far (recruiter, hiring manager, peer, other line manager). Unfortunately, Johnson and Johnson froze hiring of external candidates. I do appreciate the professionalism and candor demonstrated during the process and hope that circumstances will be more favorable in the near future."
"I think that the process was pretty clear. I did not find it very confusing or unusual, due to the fact that I only submitted my application online. "
I think that the process is pretty good.
I think that the process is easy and clear
I think that the person that conducted my face to face interview in HR in Guaynabo was not really prepared and fell to sleep during my interview I was really impacted by it I felt like she did not pay attention to my answers. I really think she is not qualified for that sensitive position and JJ might be loosing very talented professionals. Please feel free to call. If you want more detalis. She might probably have a health problem.
I think that the more soon the candidate here back of the results of the application then the more better perception is close to be the participation on it.
I think that potentially adding a generic picture of the job in the job posting that summarizes the position's duties would make the application more appealing by providing the applicant with a visualization of the position.
"I think that one of the main areas that the recruitment process could improve would be: more consistency in regard to company/name/brand/labeling. I am personally familiar with the J&J/DePuy/Synthes as brands, but there could be some confusion for others that are not as familiar in the industry.

Overall, the recruitment process is very easy and intuitive."
I think that Johnson and Johnson are doing great job.
"I think that Johnson & Johnson should email the applicants to let them know if they have been denied from a job. I have applied to a few jobs, but unfortunately I never received a response from J&J."
I think that Johnson & Johnson is really good at staying on top of their potential recruits and updating them throughout the process. 
I think that it is a very comprehensive process. 
I think that is excellent process. Thanks.
I think that in order for J&J to receive better feedback. I would send out the survey once the applicant finished the application. Other than that the application process was really easy and efficient.
I think that everything is great. Really appreciate the requested feedback. Shows you care. Thank you. 
I think that as of now the process is okay
"I think that any recruitment process should have a timeline for filling the opened position and include ""a feedback to an applicant""  with a notification when position is filled."
"I think that all employers are missing out on strong, qualified candidates by relying too heavily upon automated systems.  I have worked in the energy business for 34 years and served as Chief of Staff (as well as other VP level positions).  I missed 5 days of work in 34 years.  I implemented major projects resulting in savings of over a half a billion dollars.  In 4 years of searching, I have filled out over 4,000 online applications with only a handful of responses.  Something is wrong in  the recruitment process. 

I applied with J&J because it is a highly reputable company with an excellent product line.  The commute is reasonable and I think I have a lot to offer your company.  I will continue to use your web site."
"I think that a short survey asking applicants to describe, in short responses, their idea of the importance of the work of J & J. As Healthcare professionals, we have a unique responsibility to not only our customers.....but their "" customers ""
....their patients ."
"I think system is fair and it executes nearly to perfection on recruitment processes. Despite more are needed to be done but overall, I will award 9/10 for the flexibility and adaptability of the process, but candidates or applicants should be contacted even if they miss the cut."
I think spot checking applications from time to time may be favorable for certain positions that a computer will not take all into consideration. I think the organization needs to look at other means to finding top talent with the increase of competition in healthcare 
"I think sending out an email asking for feedback about a recruitment process for a job posting which I never received a response to is a little silly, don't you agree?"
I think providing timely communication is very important.
"I think process is great and like new format of submission online application.  Once I submitted application I can get automatic reply and check my status. I love feature that I can track status of my application, however, that status is unchanged for over 1 month and I still pending and waiting to hear what are next steps.  I wish someone would update maybe bi-monthly if process taking that long, or I just wonder if applicants who submitted resume if they got to next round or not.  

Overall great new improved website.  Thank you 
"
"I think overall the initial application is very intuitive and easy to fill out. My only interest is in the post-application process, to put video each applicant with a response, regardless of the decision. "
"I think overall it is pretty good, of course I have no gauge as to what is not good, as I have not been looking out side the company."
I think one improvement could be better communication of application status.
I think my situation was a great outcome. From others. i'm hearing communication can be more. Never can over communicate about where an applicant stands in the process.
"I think making a face to face meeting with the candidates is a plus, because you know the candidate at first glance and personally is a plus for each one."
"I think Johnson and Johnson has a very clear process and also provides resources to look up answers to frequently asked questions, which helps prevent unnecessary contact while the process is taking place. It is very convenient to have an online portal to access all of your information and to see pertinent updates. "
"I think Johnson & Johnson should provide regular updates to the candidates as the selection process progresses. I applied for a job on February 17, 2017 and other than a confirmation that my application was submitted, I have not heard anything since regarding my consideration for the job.  It leaves you feeling abandoned and Johnson & Johnson does not have a clear process of their hiring process.
"
"I think Johnson & Johnson has made the initial stages of the recruitment process very simple and easy. As a candidate, I would love to receive an update on my candidacy for the role in which I have applied as well as a contact I could connect with. I have heard great things about Johnson & Johnson from a friend that works there and look forward to working with you guys in the future!"
"I think Johnson & Johnson has a great recruitment process already.  Very reputable company, great values, and a wonderful place to work. The application process was also very smooth. 

Kind Regards,
Nicole D. Cesa"
"I think Johnson & Johnson do a very good job in the recruiting process. I would like to see more medical device companies to look closer to candidates that have DME , wound and Pharmaceutical Sales experience like myself to start in the Associate Sales position like I apply for.  I think it is a positive way for candidates that want to get into the medical device industry.  "
I think Johnson & Johnson did a great job with the recruitment process. Everything was communicated on time and I was given great respect for my busy schedule. I have recommended many colleagues to apply to Johnson & Johnson.
"I think Johnson & Johnson can improve the process by letting candidates know why they weren't selected for the position, this way I can improve myself so next time when I apply for a position I have a better chance at getting a interview. Thanks Darryl"
"I think Johnson & Johnson and the managers do a pretty good job at not only posting the positions on their website, but for internal candidates, manager do reach out to other people managers letting them know that a position is available.  This is only good if the managers trickle the message down to their direct reports.

Also, it can be tough knowing what key words to select to ensure us as candidates are receiving the right postings for our interests/skills.  Maybe having a description or an example associated with each key word, so it's more clear."
"I think job fairs in the tri-state area and in New Jersey.

Thank you"
I think JNJ is doing a commendable job and doing the right things...Continuous Process Improvement is just that continuous...The only other thing they could do to improve their recruit process is hire me! :-)
I think J&J's recruiting process so far has been one of the best I have came across.
"I think J&J is missing talented people unemployed from others industries. If you don't have pharmaceutical experienced no consideration is taken. 
J&J should create a recruitment program for professional talented people coming from others industries like electronics, assembly, injection molding, cable tv, etc. 

These people are ready to join the J&J family. We have professionalism, work ethics, management skills, years of experience, commitment, leadership, compromise and loyalty that in J&J will take years for developing in actual employees.

At the end of the day J&J is not munufacturing rockets to go to the moon. Any person can learn a new product and a new process in less than a month. If not you are out.... fair chance and fair statement.

In this island if you are more than 50 years old, you done. 

Respectfully yours,

Jose M Salas
Industrial Engineer

"I think J&J has one of the most seamless interfaces for requirement and really identifies the scope and expectations for their positions clearly. The main reason I applied is because I strongly align with the strategy of J&J to invest in business intelligence and artificial intelligence. I'm familiar with their robotics endeavor with Google having consulted for one of their compeitors that are also launching a robot(Covidien/Metronic).  While I loved the engineering, design and technology behind their product they didn't have a strong focus on BI and the design of data capture for process improvement and machine learning. I'm hoping J & J can create a barrier to entry and competitive advantage with a focus on BI.  As someone who has created startup's for value based medicine my entire career and only being 33, I know I can create transformation change specifically within this role. I look forward to speaking more about this role to see if our visions align. "
I think J&J has a great recruitment process.  Continuous improvement is a main strength in Process Excellence in J&J.  Keep raising the bar.   
I think J&J does a great job with the recruitment process.
"I think J&J career website is one of the better ones out there. It was fast and effortless compared to other companies recruitment website which may take long time to load resume or pre-register with an account. J&J also gives feedback on the recruiting decisions which no other companies I have applied do that. 

It just that questions regarding disability or ethic origin make candidates feel like J&J screen people right out depending on the answers that are giving. As a previous employee, I knew these questions are not there to screen out candidates but to help include a percentage of ethnic minorities and candidates with disabilities. However, these questions make me feel like you only want people with certain ethnic origin or without disability. It doesn't seem very fair to have to answer these questions before the skills are being evaluated. "
I think its important to provide updates to the potential employee - there has been past application experiences  in which I have no idea what has happened to my application
I think its good. 
"i think its good to me as it is , 


thank you 
raghdah "
I think it's seamless.
"I think it's nothing to Change, the process and the job posting, all Very clear with the expecification, the Johnson's recruitment is  exactly the way that it has to be."
"I think it's important to have better communication on an applicants status after the application has been submitted. Candidates, like myself, can spend up to 30 minutes to an hour applying for a position, so I think receiving emails notifying people on their status (such as it's been viewed by HR, it's still being considered or not considered, etc.) would be extremely beneficial so people know where they stand. "
I think it's important to get back to applicants regarding the status of their application in a timely manner.  
I think it's great the job was posted on Linkedin.  This is how I've been conducting my job searches since graduating from graduate school.  Professional social media outlets are a great recruiting mechanism.
I think it's fine as it is.
I think it's already great. I don't have any suggestions on what to do differently. 
I think it's a little harder to find these opportunities now that they have switched from using the Career Connections websites.  It's not as clear cut where to go to find open job postings.
I think it would be nice to get a status update and if not being considered should be notified.
I think it would be helpful for Johnson & Johnson to notify the candidate at the different stages of the application review process. Whether or not your application is actually under review/viewed or if the company has decided to move forward with other candidates. 
I think it would be great to get a personal touch. I have not talked with a recruiter once. 
"I think it would be good for J&J's recruiters to place greater emphasis on transferrable skills, particularly if the applicant holds a Ph.D. in biological or physical science.  "
"I think it will be very easy to apply if all the application questions are in 1 page (scrollable) instead of having multiple pages and having to click next on every page. If this survey was given immediately after the application, your success rate of getting this survey filled out be more than 90% I believe. Another reason is: most of the applicants may not even remember how was the interface when they applied for job unless it truly sticks to their mind. Thank you."
I think it was well set up on the website. I don't see any changes that Johnson and Johnson should do to improve the recruitment process at this time.
I think it was a satisfactory process to recruit the ideal Staff Scientist R&D.
I think it is satisfactory at it's current status 
I think it is ok! No improvement is necessary.
I think it is good enough.
I think it is an excellent process.
"I think it is a very good process, please continue with this"
I think it is a great process.
"I think in general it was a good experience. The description should be more specific about the skills, nationality, background, etc"
"I think HR personnel need to review credentials and think outside the box. Some candidates might not have the detailed, specific qualifications but like me have a strong educational background and are employable assets that should be considered. I think lately the online process is dehumanizing and filled with lack of understanding of resumes"
I think everythinh is great!
"I think creating a ""referred by"" field where someone like me can indicate which employee referred me to Johnson & Johnson can tremendously help the recruiting process. Right now the only option I have when being asked how did I hear about this job is indicating that I've been referred. It does not ask me which employee referred me to this position.

This way, the recruitment team can quickly reach out to that employee to verify the referral and see if that employee can really vouch for that applicant."
I think better communication of the status of the application would a plus. 
I think applicants should be kept abreast of their application status. The waiting period seems to be too long. Talents can be lost in this way due to prolong anticipation to working with the company. I will be excited to work for the company if given a chance to do so.
"I think all is OK,"
"I think a timeline would be helpful. At the moment, I am responding to a recruiting survey while not knowing if I am being actively considered for a position. I have applied for numerous positions in the Global Community Impact area, but I am not sure of the recruiting process timeline and if and when I might be contacted regarding my candidacy for any of these positions. "
I think  you do a great job with your recruiting process.
"I suppose follow up?  I don't recall receiving any information about the position.  This is very common; I apply and don't hear back (often for years).  Most positions that I feel wonderfully qualified for, I'll eventually get a notice that the position has been eliminated (after a couple of years of my application sitting in the system). I've been very disappointed with what's become an impenetrable wall between well-qualified candidates and hiring managers that's present in the form of a ""web application"".  "
"I suggest you have a staff of recruiters on messenger who can chat with prospective candidates before they even apply to help gauge whether there's a two-way fit and worth the time of the candidate and J&J to invest further...would be fast, simple, and provide a better experience for everyone"
I suggest to delineate the recruitment process in the acknowledgement e-mail of application submission.
"I suggest providing applicants with a status of their application should help in how I view J&J. I applied for this position more than a month ago and I never received a status update or a call from an internal recruiter, so I am assuming J&J is not interested in talking to me...funny I was reached out to provide feedback. Thanks."
"I submitted to this role as I have previously worked at J&J as a consultant.  I felt I was a good fit, but my application got rejected within 24 hours for a reason I do not understand.  More specific feedback would be appreciated."
"I submitted my resume March 3rd, 2017 and have not heard an update on status (currently 3/15/7). 
Some type of update would be beneficial."
"I submitted my application through a referral, but I haven't heard anything regarding my application. Understanding timing and the review process would be helpful. "
"I submitted my application and then it went into the blackhole and I never heard back one way or the other after 4 weeks.  I was qualified for the position, but never heard a response back.  I have since taken a higher level position with another competitive company who responded much more quickly.

I would also like the opportunity to see my download submissions before I submit."
I submitted my application and never received a response... that was/is a bit frustrating.
I submitted my application and never heard from J and J directly except that my application had been accepted. I was not informed from them directly any further than that but had to call an outside recruiter to find out that they had gone with another candidate. 
"I submitted my aplicación since I considered my experience an excelent fit for the organization, I believe
I have exceptional credentials and suficient professional Experience to
Make
The type of
Contribution to Jnj. But I never heard back. I believe that if a person is applying at least should get a personal reply saying why the resume wasn't a good fit.

"I submitted for this position on or about 4/18/17. It would be more helpful to have received this survey within a week or so.
Thank you.

I submitted an application to Johnson and Johnson two months ago and just received an email asking me to take a survey. It would be nice to hear back about the application. 
I submitted an application package via the on the black hole known as the web portal. I have had no communication after clicking submit. 
"I submitted an application over 2 weeks ago and have heard NOTHING from anyone.  I can understand if my qualifications do not meet the position's needs, but it would be helpful to hear back something."
"I submit to you that the application process is too lengthy. Reduce average time to complete to ~5 - 10 mins.

An explanation on how to do so will cost an interview :D "
I strongly believe that the recruitment process that I've experienced with Johnson & Johnson is very effective and bearable. I don't think it needs improvement at all. 
I still haven't received any responses from the job that I applied. It will be helpful if they can review the process little quicker and get back sooner than later. It will be good to have a closure if I am not a good fit to the company. 
I still haven't heard if I am a candidate.  Thanks. 
I still haven't heard back from Johnson & Johnson and would love to move forward in the interview process. 
"I still haven't heard back from anyone, it would be nice to know if I am being considered or if they don't believe I am a viable candidate "
"I still haven't heard back about the position, feedback on application status "
I still have not yet heard back concerning my application.
I still have not heard regarding the position from he HR Department
"I still have not heard if I am being considered for this role and I'm going on the assumption that I am not.  It would be nice to be informed sooner, rather than later (or in some cases, never at all) if a candidate is no longer being considered for an open position.  I'm sure it would very beneficial to anyone as they assess their overall job search strategy.   Thanks,  "
I still have not heard back from the Medical Sales Rep position I had previously applied for. If there is anything else I can do please feel free to let me know. I am still very much interested. Thank you so much.
I still have not heard back after submitting my application. It's been almost 2 weeks. 
I still have not heard anything positive or negative from my application to this role. Feedback from my skill set and interview if I am granted one would be appreciated as well.
I still have not hear back from anyone post application submission so it would be helpful to have heard back one way or the next.  Thank you!
"I still don't know where I fall within the process I was never followed up on after the call... best of luck regardless, Daniel Atkins"
"I spoke with an HR recruiter and had a good conversation. I was told that I would here from the hiring manager within the week.  I still have not heard back from anyone at J&J---it has been about six weeks since my initial phone conversation. If I am not the ideal candidate, I would at least expect a phone call or email letting me know, I have not heard either way. "
"I speak fluent Spanish and I am Caucasian. As demographics grow nationally and internationally we have become more interconnected. Johnson and Johnson might recruit from more traditional Ivy League universities, but the real reward is in the relationships built at the ground level and within the communites one relationship at a time. I say this because speaking fluent Spanish and being of non Latino decent has let me break down barriers and build bridges to grow my business and close the divide in the sales process. Johnson and Johnson is a recognized name and that name should be greeted by people like myself who builds a bridge to the future. "
"I sent the recruiter an email about timeline etc. I have not heard back from the recruiter, would be nice to have a status update on timeline and next steps from the recruiter. "
I sent a thank you to the interviewer via e-mail but his mail box was full.  I tried  several more times with the same result.  I never heard back (positive or negative) (just no response) from anyone from J&J either via e-mail or phone after my face to face interview.  
"I sent a resume into the black hole of the internet.  There wasn't much to it.  However, it was fast.  Don't rely on the application parsed from resume text for anything it is not likely very good information.  "
"i send out applications all the time...and not once did i get a personal response.  never got a phone interview or follow up.  i need a job badly and know that i can do many of these jobs that i applied for and those that i cannot, i am qualified enough to learn the balance that I am not familiar with."
I saw two different websites where I was able to apply. That was confusing. I applied to both at different times. One of them was extremely modern and user friendly. The UI/UX was gorgeous. I loved that one. The other was outdated and difficult to manage. I would love to work on both :). Thank you for the opportunity. 
"I respect and admire J&J for considering my application but they would have called me in personal to talk about more opportunity related to my experience in Quality Assurance.

No regret.. always I wait for the good opportunity from my dream company!! J&J."
"I replied to an earlier review request.

I was not at all contacted or informed of a denial, alas somewhat unprofessional handling of the recruitment process for people with 10+ years of experience."
I recommend the talent acquisition team to phone screen candidates.
I recommend adopting a more user friendly application platform such as Workday.
"I recently submitted an application for a position (Senior Scientist Neuroscience Medicinal Chemistry (1700157503W)).   I received an email less than 1 hour later stating that I did not meet the minimum requirements of the position.  Are filters being used to eliminate a candidate?  I am shocked by a rejection email less than 1 hour after submission. 
 
I think I fulfill the requirements of that position.  

I do not possess a Ph.D., I have an MS in organic chemistry.   I have 34 yrs experience, worked for a highly successful and respected biotech company in which I served as Medicinal chemistry leader of teams of 3-10 chemists, managed CRO chemist, served as a strategic member of project teams, served as a strategic member of collaboration programs with outside oraganizations, and authored over 90 publications and patents.  "
"I recently received an email regarding another J&J position for which I applied that stated I was not being considered.  I appreciated this.  For other applications that I have submitted, I have received no response.

For the position of the Senior Manager IT Enterprise Architecture, I interviewed with a HR representative who told me the next step was for the manager to determine it he would interview me.  I received no further communication.

Consistency in communicating the status of applications - especially when an interview has been requested and given - would be an improvement."
I recently did a video interview for a position which I thought was quite innovative.
I received your request for me to participate in your survey more than 30 days after I applied for an open position. I have yet to receive any correspondence from JNJ concerning this position. Seems to me that you are more concerned about the process (selfish) than the position (customer).
"I received two separate responses to this submission: one indicating the role had been cancelled, and the other indicating that I ""... didn't make it through ..."".  One overall response might be preferable.  Thank you."
"I received two emails asking me to complete this survey. The first email contained a broken survey link. This didn't bother me, but it might be annoying to other candidates!"
"I received this survey, while receiving nothing else regarding my application status. "
"I received this survey, however, I have not met with anyone regarding the position. I would suggest that this may have been more applicable once I have had the opportunity to talk with a hiring manager. "
"I received this survey, but no other response except a computer generated reply saying my application was received. Very informal process."
I received this survey request but do not recall an email that declined me from consideration for the role. 
I received this survey but I didnt hear status on the application I submitted for the position.  I would have liked to hear feedback prior to receiving a survey. 
I received this survey but have not had a response about my application.  
I received these emails before being contacted by someone from the Talent & Acquisition Group at Johnson&Johnson. I assume they were spam mail and didn't answer them. So I would make sure the applicant was contact first prior to sending emails. Thank you. 
I received notice that the role was eliminated so I have yet to secure an interview with J&J but look forward to the future possibility.
I received no response to my application beyond the auto acknowledgement that my application online was submitted.
"I received no follow-up as of yet. Either way, candidate follow-up in a timely matter would be appreciated."
I received no feedback regarding my application. To be honest I can't surely say when I even applied to this position.
"I received no feedback during the process that I was no longer in contention for the role.  

One week later I got an email asking to use my network of people for a similar role and not for me to apply for that same role.  I doubt that anyone who is left hanging during the recruitment process will open up their network to your HR team.  It just did not feel right."
"I received an email notifying me that I was not being considered for a role, but I couldn't determine to which role the email was referring. I have multiple applications active."
I received an email asking if I was willing to relocate despite there being no relocation package.  Then I never heard from the recruiter again. This made me think twice about J&J since I didn't receive a response when I asked if I was going to have a phone interview. 
"I received an email and phone call around 1 week post application and was asked, which was a great turnaround time to hear back . I was asked to follow up in a week if I did not hear anything. It has been 3 weeks now and I have attempted to reconnect with the recruiter 3-4x but have not heard back. Would like to be updated on a more timely basis if there is a plan to interview. Zero problems in other areas of the application process including referrral process. "
"I received an automated email after being referred by a J&J employee for 4 positions.  The email told me to use a specific UserName code (to be entered in the email address field) and Password when logging into jnj.jibeapply.com/apply website. When I do, it says ""The value you have entered in the field ""User Name"" does not correspond to a registered user"".  There was no one for me to speak to for resolution.  I lost a fantastic referral opportunity and I still have not heard from anyone regarding any of the positions I applied to or was given a referral for.  I was previously a J&J employee and hope to be again."
"I received an automated denial letter after I had applied for this role. I reached out to the recruiter on the reasons why, but I have not received a response."
"I received an automated acknowledgement, I received advertisements about other job postings, I've received a survey, BUT, I have yet to receive and feedback on the actual job for which I applied."
"I received a response to my application very quickly, and had my first interview relatively quickly (after a second follow up from my side). The recruiter gave me very positive feedback and told me she will recommend that the hiring manager speaks to me next. She said to follow up if I don't hear anything in a week. I have followed up several times since then and have gotten no reply, which has been a pretty negative experience. It would be nice to get a response either way, especially after a conversation. "
"I received a request for this survey, however, I have no communication on the status of my candidacy.  Would appreciate communication on that status prior to filling out a satisfaction survey."
"I received a form email rejection in less then a couple of hours of applying for a role that was on perfectly on-point with my background, experience and expertise; and for which I presented impeccable credentials and a resume aligned with the position. The quick form rejection email leaves the impression that the role was already filled and shouldn't have been continued to be posted, and/or my credentials and CV were carefully reviewed and considered.  I am hesitant to continue to apply to the company or make a positive recommendation on the recruitment and talent acquisition process given the abrupt and apparently unconsidered thought given to my  application.  It is disappointing, because it was a company that I wanted for some time to join, and that from a product standpoint has a good reputation...but the two have to work together.  "
"I received a confirmation email that my application had been received & that I could visit a website for career opportunities. The application process should be clear cut - ""yes,"" future interview, or ""no,"" candidate is not the right fit."
"I received a call from the recruiter.  She was extremely helpful and positive.  She told me that she would be moving me to the next step.  I have not heard from anyone.
I was a former employee of J&J, the Ethicon, Inc. division.  While with Ethicon I had a stellar sales career earning a spot into the $150K, $250K, $500K Sales Clubs along with winning the coveted Glamour Trip to Marbella Spain.
My current position is with Roche selling Diabetes Care Products...exactly what the position I was applying for is responsible for selling.  
Sad that my talent and experience is not looked upon in a more positive way."
"I received a call from one of the recruiters about their interest for a Sr. Java Developer position in their new Tampa office. After the initial discussion, there has been no progress at all. One thing I suggest to improve the current recruitment process is to email the applicants if they are not being considered for a job position. I think the recruitment process is ultra slow in J&J."
"I receive my ""no thank you e-mail"" about 12 hours after I submitted my application which leads me to believe that this a highly automated recruitment system looking for very specific terms or requirements. I find that to be discouraging. I was applying for a sales role and I feel strongly that had my application been reviewed by a human I would have been given consideration. Or at the very least I would feel better about applying in the future if it hadn't been kicked out of the system so quickly. "
I really want to get the interview opportunity of this job.
I really like the idea of this small survey. It is one of the small differences which makes Johnson & Johnson's reputation as an industry leader. 
"I really like Johnson & Johnson's application process. It is quick, user-friendly, and stress-free."
"I really have no issues with the J&J process, however possibly one improvement could be making it a little easier to sign up for alerts. I hope this helps!"
I really enjoyed you application process! Compared to most other companies the process was straight forward and headache free!
"I really enjoyed taking this survey. In regards to my overall experience and how I felt about the application process to the company over all.

 "
"I really don't see the jobs advertised anywhere on job boards, maybe that is on purpose not to widely and vastly post openings"
"I really care to better the world around me. ""Be the change you wish to see in the world."" When the candidate applies for the multiple jobs. Same below questions appear every time even though answer does not mostly change. Suggestion : Just show all these questions and answers previously provided by the candidate, provide edit ability to change. That will make the job application smarter and will save time for the candidate

"I really cannot suggest any improvements at this time.  From my perspective, the recruitment process was a very positive experience.  Everyone involved (i.e. recruiter/interview panel was highly professional and helpful.  The interactions I had during the interview process were stimulating and thought provoking.  I am excited about the prospect of taking on a new role at Johnson & Johnson and appreciate the opportunity to be able to discuss my interests and qualifications."
"I really appreciated the message where you make me aware of the missmatch, but it would be better if you would explain why. That will allow me to be ready in the future. 

"
"I really appreciated how easy the application process was. I'm very happy with how it has gone so far, but I am eager to hear back on the status of my application. "
I really appreciate feedback.
"I really am looking forward to the interview and to continue my career at Johnson & Johnson.  However, I cannot answer a couple of the above questions effectively because I have not been contacted for this career opportunity at this time, to discuss the role.
Hope to here from you soon.

"I realize this is how all companies seem to manage the hiring process, but it is very impersonal to submit a professional (doctorate level) resume with significant experience and just get back a one line rejection letter weeks later that says they are not considering my application.  The old fashioned verbal conversation with a live person may actually reveal ""talent"" that you don't even know you are missing out on.  I have applied for other positions at J and J and got same response.  Not sure if it is worth still trying to apply."
I realize there are many if not too many applicants but if not being considered would like to know right away.
"I realize the volumes of resumes require word match technology, but, I suppose I miss the old days of having HR recognize transferable skills.  So, where you ask if the role was descriptive, maybe you can help reduce the volume of resumes by identifying what skills would be considered as transferable.  It would be an beneficial experience for me to see what kind of resume analysis is performed to hire your more senior executives.  "
"I realize that you handle  a good amount of candidates, it would be nice to get a slightly faster response to an application. 
"
"I realize that J&J gets many applicants for a job, but some feedback would be appreciated."
"I realize it's difficult to comb through multiple applications, however sometimes when doing so you might just find the perfect candidate for the position your in need of. Don't rule out candidates just because they don't match all of your criteria.  There are so many whom are talented and offer the drive for success with their transferable skills that could be a great addition to your team.  "
"I realize getting back to each applicant can be tough, but a system to circle back and let applicants know where they stand - or an online job application tracker to visually show progress (or lack thereof) of the application, would be extremely helpful. "
"I probably can't help with that.. as in that is out of my area of expertise, but I find it frustrating how all of the jobs posted (and there's a lot of jobs), require specific qualifications that make me disqualify despite my experience and university degree in Biomedical Engineering.
This can be improved depending on the status of applications to J&J
If J&J is getting more than enough applications that match all the specific qualifications criteria, then the specific qualifications should remain to screen the less relevant candidates.
If J&J is not getting perfect matches, then it would be useful to look for candidates with less specific criteria that are willing to learn and train to become competent. Somehow like McDonald's burger franchise do it, but not as broad.
From my former experience as a Sales and Service Biomedical Engineer, I expect that I would be able to learn 50% of what is required for the job in the first two weeks, and 90% of it by the end of the third month. I would hate to be disqualified by this learning curve.
I would like to hear an HR's opinion on this, and in case I need to sub-specialize in the Biomedical Engineering domain, would you please let me know which sub-specialty is in the most demand?

I previously worked for the company and resigned to complete my education. I had more success with receiving interviews then. I'm a great employee. Your recruitment system/process seams not to recognize potential applicant abilities. 
I posted for this position in mid January.  I did not hear back until early April.
I personally think this is the best I ever seen. My only question is if my information will be taken to another position that J&J believes I will fit better to
I personally think that the company should hire candidates from the outside.
"I personally think that J & J has been doing good but in terms of promotion, perhaps could emphasize on sharing it often through electronic media, it might be helpful to boost the number of clients in getting to know more about the company. "
I personally feel that the application process was good enough for applicant to understand the job description and what organization needs.
"I personally believe that the recruitment process was very good with Johnson & Johnson. If I had to pick one thing to improve on with the recruiting process, I would have to say that getting back with potential candidates quicker would be the best improvement that I have seen. With that being said, I do understand that nationwide, there are many job opportunities posted from Johnson & Johnson so that does make it tough to go through every single one and identify those potential candidates for the job in a shorter time period. "
I personally applied via Linkedin and I feel they should contact the applicant with his or her status. 
"I originally applied with LinkedIn and a few days later I went to check the J&J career website,my application did not show up.  I had to re-apply going directly through the J&J website. Other than that, there were no issues.  I hope this helps.

I have not heard anything about my application yet.  I am looking forward to hearing from J&J.

"I only received a confirmation that my resume was on file, other than that I am guessing I did not receive any other consideration without further communication."
"I only have experience with the online application; so at this point I cannot provide a complete feedback in regard to the recruitment process. 

The online application was easy to use, I don't see a reason to make any changes.

"I of course would welcome the opportunity to speak with someone live.  Other than that, the process was fair balanced, succinct and as mentioned above, very intuitive. "
"I never received notification that my candidacy ended.  Perhaps it isn't?  I am not clear on this.  I feel that my qualifications for the posted position were exemplary, and I felt that my phone conference went quite well.  I have concerns that the interviewer may have overstated J&J's willingness to move me forward to the next level, to no avail.  I also wish the interviewer had asked more questions in the time allotted.  I respect Johnson & Johnson and hope to one day help the company be a great place for employees where important work is performed and recognized."

I never received feedback from JnJ concerning this opportunity. I've applied for several positions but I usually don't get any correspondence.
I never received anything to say if my resume was reviewed. It would be nice to get an acknowlement that they looked at it and have moved on with other candidates. 
"I never received any update on what happened after the submission.  In today's world that seemed harsh.  There is no closure of the loop if not selected.

I never receive a response about my candidacy status.  I receive a confirmation of my bid but never hear anything back so I'm assuming I am not being interviewed!  Thank you.
I never interviewed for this particular position or advanced through the recruitment process. I will say that the job description was very clear and the role and work environment were very appealing. Thanks!  
I never heard from the recruiter except an email saying my skills match and please apply. Then silence ... not even a standard communication that the job was filled and they would keep my resume on file. 
I never heard from Johnson & Johnson after applying for this position.
I never heard from J&J regarding the position. It would have been nice to receive an email letting me know I wasn't selected.

I never heard from anyone either way. 
I never heard from anyone and no one called for an interview 
I never heard back. ☺️
I never heard back regarding my application and was referred based on my past success in oncology sales. I am still interested in the role. 
"I never heard back on this position until this survey. I am confused as to if this position has been filled, or remains open."
"I never heard back from them. I live close by to the job, have the correct skills, etc.  At the very least they should back a typical form letter, but ideally a personal response as the status of the role. "
"I never heard back from my application to this job other than this survey. I applied to another job at J&J and I received an email that I would be a great fit for your company and the talent acquisition team referred me to a job I already applied to, so I re-applied and I haven't received any further communications. I would love to work for J&J, but not happy with the employment application process."
I never heard back from anyone to know that my application went through properly 
"I never heard back from anyone so as it states right now, I thought I was still in the process but apparently, I did not get an interview?????

There was no communication at all so it is hard to give any review since I have heard anying at all."
I never heard back from anyone after speaking to two different HR recruiters who told me they would let the hiring manager know about my skillset.
"I never heard back from a human, even though this was via an employee referral."
I never heard back either way. I would have liked to know one way or another!
I never heard back after my application. I applied a few weeks ago and would like to be updated on the process more often. Thanks! 
I never heard back after my application. 
I never heard back after my application was reviewed. It would be great gesture to reach out to applicants.

I never heard back after applying
"I never heard anything from J&J one way or the other regarding my application, nada, nothing zip which is very frustrating. Then I get this survey asking how they did...are you kidding me?

Maybe they could improve by replying to candidates."
I never heard anything back. A response would be good. 
"I never heard anything about my application. So I am assuming that by receiving this survey, it means I am no longer in consideration for this position.  It would've been nice to have heard updates through the selection process."
"I never heard any feedback from the position and I am a Director and VP of Engineering, Operations, and Quality Assurance in the Consumer product industries and was disappointed that no response was given considering the length of time and effort to fill out the application.

J&J needs to do a better job of follow up especially with a qualified candidate."
"I never heard about my application until this survey.  Now I wonder if you emailed me and it got lost in my spam mail.  If there was an interest, I would have liked a phone call."
I never heard a thing from Johnson & Johnson until now.  A simple acknowledgement of receiving my application and if I am a potential candidate for the job would of been nice
I never had the opportunity to speak with anyone about this role.  I would have loved to had the opportunity to pursue it further. 
"I never got anything back for the posting,  I didn't get denied,  but I didn't get an offer either so it's hard to tell where I stand in recruitment process."
"I never got a reply on whether my application was even viewed, or even an automatic rejection email that you would be pursuing other candidates. I spent hours drafting my application for it to presumably not even get looked at. This has left me with a negative opinion of Johnson and Johnson's organization. As well, I never hear back from your company, and then you send me this survey asking for feedback. This just confirms my initial feelings on your company's talent acquisition. As a reputable company, Johnson and Johnson should improve this recruitment process. Give your candidates/applicants the benefit of communication, let them feel as if their work was actually considered. Continue to be one of Canada's best employers. Good luck!"

"I need heard back from anyone at J&J to the status of my application , it would be nice to reply back to the status of an application "
"I must say I was a bit puzzled/ confused when I was recommended by a current j & j employee and she was advised that I, the applicant would hear something from j&j but I never heard anything until today with the exception that my application was received. The current j&j employee also spoke with the talent recruiter to be advised what the steps were for applying. I understand this position was very popular and saw that over 1,000 people reviewed the position. I just believe better communication would be appreciated. Thank you for the opportunity to apply. Respectfully "
I met the qualifications posted; yet received a not qualified or was it found applicants more qualified.  I believe my age or heritage disqualified me from having a legitimate opportunity OR this position was being posted to follow company procedures and the successful (internal) candidate had already been selected.
I met all of the required and preferred qualifications for the role and was not selected for a phone screen. 
I loved the LinkedIn reach-outs! I had Kristen Bondi/a recruiter reach out to me on LinkedIn and I applied from there- I really appreciated the personal reach out.
"I love to join and work for Johnson & Johnson. I know this company when I start my profession in Pharmaceuticals industry.  I was dreamed to join the team and be part of the company. 

Excellent products.
Great Reputation.
Well known company

Thanks. "
I love the simple recruitment process! I would love to get quick feedback on my application. Thank you for this opportunity! 
I love it!
"I look forward to moving along with J&J so that I can give you a better answer towards the end of the process.
Best regards,"
I look forward to hopefully having an opportunity to interview for this position. 
I look forward to hearing from a recruiter.
I look forward to an interview.  I will be a valuable asset to J&J. 
"I live literally a block from Ethicon (J&J company). I hold a bachelor's degree in biology/chemistry/Spanish, and over a year of experience in manufacturing and quality control. Yet, I don't even get a call back for an interview or just to chat. 

However, you guys (or Kelly's Services) are going out of your way to recruit people from out of state or other cities. This is San Angelo. People like me are scarce. At least give me a chance. "
I liked how easy the application was - it makes searching for a job a lot less stressful when you don't have to worry about a tedious application. 
"I like websites like Indeed. I go on Indeed often but I have not seen any Johnson & Johnson job openings there. I like the ease that that website offers, its straightforward and not complicated."
"I like this questionnaire, if you may add similar questions, I mean questions to verify the applicants' integrity, ethics, and etc., it will be beneficial for good team building.  "
"I like the way a candidate can upload a resume and cover letter without having it autofill into an application which has to be corrected.
I would suggest a comments field other than the one provided about commuting. For example, one question asked if I had experience in two different areas. The answer was yes and no. I would have liked to clarify my answer with a comment."
I like the update to show where you are in the application process.  Nice improvement!
"I like the new tracking ability, this is a great addition. It would be beneficial to get an update on the status much quicker. I am still under review, which seems to be a long review period. "
I like the format that shows where your application is in the process.  
"I like that a decision was made quickly, even if it was not favorable to me."
I like applying with only my resume and a few questions. 
I learned about the opportunity online with LinkedIn because I have been focusing my search on Ohio metro cities. The opportunity popped up and seemed interesting!
"I know you must receive thousands of applications, but timely  feedback is always appreciated.  A job offer would be the best way to  improve the process!"
"I know there is a huge volume of applicants for each role, but anything to speed up the process of hearing back would be awesome. "
I know there are lot of applications coming your way... but there should be a transparecy system as to why a certain application was not carried forward.. there can be a screening test which can evaluate the candidates. A good score will invite a call and a not qualifying score wouldnt ...
"I know that you are a big company and there are probably a ton of applicants applying for many jobs, but maybe provide more of a time line or update on how the application process is going. I think clearity of the process would be helpful. "
"I know that this would be difficult to do with the amount of candidates that apply for a position, but if there was a way to explain why a candidate was not chosen for the position would be very helpful for that person moving forward."
"I know that the decision making process takes time, but providing feedback early on during the recruiting process would give candidates a feeling that the application is not lost in the interweb."
"I know that the application process was intuitive simply because I don't remember having difficulties when I applied; the process flowed easily.

I look forward to hearing more about the position."
"I know that most of the ads are just for documentation and the company already considered the candidate. So for God's sake please don't waste the time and energy of the people who searching for the job.

"
"I know that Johnson & Johnson receives a large number of applications on a daily basis, but being contacted by someone within the company or recruiting department in regards to applications would be helpful on a job searching basis. Receiving feedback is always appreciated and constructive in terms of bettering the job search process and developing the best ways to identify opportunities to grow one's career."
"I know most companies will get 100s to 1000s of resumes for any position but it is always a huge help to get a status (not being considered, not right for this job, job has been filled, etc). The process can be automated and job seekers always appreciate feedback, whether good or bad."
"I know it's likely not practical, but it would be helpful to know if the applicant is in consideration for the applied position. 
Thank you!"
"I know it's difficult with the number of postings many roles probably receive, however qualified internal candidates should at least be given an opportunity to speak with the hiring manager.

With over 20 years of very diverse industry experience I know I'm qualified for the roles I post for, however I rarely get a call from the HR representative or the hiring manager. I'm in a fairly confined role within my function and have few working or networking opportunities with other departments. I wish the posting / interest process could help facilitate some networking opportunities."
"I know it is hard to contact each applicant, but perhaps adding a rough timeline to the automated ""you've applied"" message could give applicants an idea of when to stop waiting for a response.

thank you!"
I know it is difficult with hundreds of applicants...but any feedback on position hiring status is always appreciated....this survey is the only feedback I have at this time.
I know it is difficult to reach out to all applicants but I strongly feel it is something all companies should do as a professional courtesy.  It has the added bonus of being good for the brand.  I assume received this but am no longer being considered for the position- I hope you appreciate the dissonance between what you are asking of the applicants in the follow up to the position being filled versus what you are providing as an employer in this process.  I hope you accept this feedback in the fair minded spirit i intended.
I just would like for J & J to keep me updated periodicallly as to the status of the position and if I would be considered as a candiate for employment. I have over 15 years in pharma and medical device type sales and find that I would be an asset to the organization.  
"I just wish I was given the chance for a phone interview.  I have been out of the field for a while, but have educational experience and work experience that I believe would be a good fit.  Sometimes that doesn't come across as well in a resume.  "
"I interviewed on 17 February in Providence for this position. The interview seemed to go well, and I received an email soon after asking for another copy of my resume. After that, I never heard another thing. I would still like to work for J&J, as I was very impressed by the corporate values and the types of products under development.

"I interviewed for the position in October. Before the offer was given, there was a hiring freeze. The position became ""unfrozen"" in February. This is too long of a delay between initial contact and offer. Most candidates are not going to wait around. This position should have been grandfathered in as an offer was about to be made before the freeze. "
"I interviewed at J&J two years ago and the new application process is much quicker no has a nice simple interface. The only question that I had an issue with was salary history, this question should come further along in the process."
"I initially was unable to connect with the online application system from my home on March 24 , and forwarded a hard copy to the Aviation Department. I had called the Aviation Department and was told I had to complete an online application. I happened to be at a hotel later that evening in Wilmington, DE and was able to hookup online and complete the process very quickly within 10 minutes. I had previously spent over 2 hours at home trying to connect with the J&J server.

Conclusion; The connection with J&J from my hotel CONFIRMED that my Verizon DSL at my home is and HAS BEEN a totally inadequate internet service, as it is a 2.41mbs download speed. Therefore, the verizon DSL, has been replaced with a Service Electric Cable internet at 20 times the speed. If it hadn't been for the J&J connection problems at home, I never would know just ""how bad"" my internet speed was lacking!!"
"I I found the application process quite easy to go through.  Since the company I was a contractor for, Abbott Medical Optics, was recently acquired by Johnson & Johnson I thought applying for a full time position here would be a good idea and the process was very simple."
I hope to have the opportunity to work for this great company and contribute in the best possible way.
I hope to get a feedback at least within a week of applying to cut the waiting process.
I honestly thought it had the rare combination of ease and through.
"I honestly feel like every time I apply for a role with your company, nobody takes the time to actually see my experience, credentials and education. I believe I am a well qualified candidate with an ivy league graduate degree, and many years of domestic and international experience in the health care arena. I feel I should be given the opportunity to at least interview or be considered for other roles. "
I heard of it from a friend. Science associations ?
I heard nothing after submitting my application.  
I heard nothing about the position after I applied.  It feels almost as if my application was lost in the network somewhere.
I heard from a friend the position was filled before I seen it and applied.  It would be nice to get a message that the position is filled. I have a good job but looking for that great job again and not actively looking so I applied late...
I heard absolutely nothing after applying. The courtesy of communication seems to be a lost art on employers.  This doesn't go unnoticed. 
I haven't yet had a response to my application; it would be good to know if my application is still being considered.
I haven't spoken to anyone yet. 
I haven't received any follow up communication regarding my application. I would like to know if I am being considered for an interview.  
"I haven't received any feedback on my application. Some feedback would be great. Also, any ways I can improve my candidacy?  I am eager for this opportunity. "
I haven't received any email or call yet from j&j
I haven't received an offer today and interview. That would be a nice improvement.
"I haven't received a response as to whether or not my application was considered. I understand that there is always a process, but it would be great to get a status or where one is in the consideration process."
I haven't noticed anything yet that needs to be revamped in the recruiting process. 
"I haven't heard yet if my application is being considered, and it has been 3+ weeks since I submitted it.  I was actually a little confused that I was emailed this survey to ask to give feedback about the application process when I haven't heard back about my application status."
"I haven't heard nothing about the position neither the interview or hiring process.  Thus, it will be nice to send some kind of information if the position still available or if it has been freeze or if you have already hired someone else "
I haven't heard from the recruitment team after completing my application. Could you please give me a status update on the progress?
"I haven't heard from HR or someone in regards to the job opening but since it's my first time, I don't know how the hiring process goes. "
I haven't heard from anyone regarding this position.
I haven't heard from anyone or anything after I applied other than this survey.
"I haven't heard back regarding the opening. I understand how the process works as I was in HR for three years. However, it shouldn't take more than a week to respond to a sales role, unless the posting was old or filled. Quicker feedback on openings. "
I haven't heard back on my applications. A quick email if you will not be interviewing someone would be nice. 
"I haven't heard back from Talent Acquisition yet, but even if I wasn't going to be considered for the role, some sort of communication around thanking me for applying, but not continuing is always appreciated. "
I haven't heard back from talent acquisition 
I haven't heard back from anyone within HR around this opportunity since I posted for it on 3/20.  It would be helpful if I received an update around the process and if I am even being considered for the role.
"I haven't heard back about the job after a week or two but otherwise the application process was great.
Matt Duren"
I haven't heard anything back from the recruiters for three weeks after expecting a call. 
I haven't heard anything back from my job application process yet. 
I haven't heard anything about my application. Communication is key to all applicants to be clear on the application process and timings.
"I haven't heard anything about me specifically and my application status. Any communication would be greatly appreciated, good or bad."
I haven't heard any status updates so would be nice to be kept informed and hopefully schedule an interview. 
I haven't had enough experience to comment at this time 
"I haven't had an opportunity so far to go thru J&J's hiring process.
In spite of past experience with Pfizer Ltd from early 2000s I have not been considered. Candidates from myriad background's should also be given a chance. Thanks"
I haven't gone through the process yet
"I haven't even been asked back for an interview yet, how can I be getting my third of these feedback surveys!?"
I haven't completed the interview process as of yet so I'd reserve response for after going through the entire recruitment process.  Applying is the easy part but it has been a positive experience so far.  
"I haven't been selected for interviews and I understand the process is very competitive. I also understand that candidates that are not selected for interviews will not be contacted directly with an update on their candidacy. However, To improve the candidate experience, I believe some communication to inform the candidacy is no longer in consideration would be nice. At this point, I do not have any visibility to the status of the process - if the job is still open, my application is still under consideration, etc. "
I haven't been part of the recruitment process yet. So I wouldn't be able to comment.
I have yet to receive any feedback about my application. That is not a correct approach in my experience.
I have yet to receive any communication regarding my application. It would be helpful to know if I am still being considered as a candidate. 
"I have yet to hear back on this opportunity.  The initial email that comes back right after submission states you will hear back if there is a fit (paraphrasing)  But after several weeks if the interview process was continuing another email stating the company is still in process would be good.  Sometimes a response comes back 3-4-5 months after sending your resume.  I don't expect this to be the case with Johnson & Johnson, but it demonstrates the lag time with other companies that are competing for talent.  So improving on this aspect could be a great opportunity for J & J.  Thank you for this survey as well and reflects your commitment to people as ""people""
"
I have yet to hear back from anyone after applying for the position. I was hoping to either get an email saying what I am lacking to be considered for the company or an email saying they would like to schedule and interview. 
I have yet to hear back from a recruiter or email if still in contention etc. all I receive are emails asking for feedback on the hiring process. 
"I have yet to hear back anything about my application. If I am no longer being considered for this position, I would appreciate some acknowledgement to that fact so that at least I have an answer. I feel this is a very important step in recruitment that is often overlooked with most companies I've ever applied to and I feel that it is an easy change. "
"I have yet to be contacted one way or another in reference to my job application, quicker response time would be the only thing."
"I have written it several times and I am still writing it. Even though the process is good but I really believe that the complete online process at Johnson and Johnson is rigged.
It seems like positions are offered online just for the sake of it and the positions are either filled internally or through contacts and proper chance is not given to candidates. So applying on your site is just shooting an arrow in a murky pond with very less fish and just hoping that one of the arrows finds the fish."
I have worked for Johnson and Johnson before and really enjoyed it. 
"I have worked for Johnson and Johnson as a consultant while with PwC. You have an amazing company, with strong culture and strong products. I think you have a strong brand and can easily recruit the best of the best. 

In terms of the specific job opportunity - I did not get considered for an interview although I am a local candidate with a very close fit - not sure how I compared to the competition, that may have been a deciding factor. I have a lot of experience with recruitment and talent, so I look for people who are good problem solvers, seem to have a close cultural fit, and have a good personality - none of which you get from simply a resume. All my candidates will get a phone call from me to determine if they are a good fit. Many times, I can tell almost immediately whether they will fit culturally or if they would be successful in the job. Perhaps that is one area where J&J could improve. 

Thank you for offering me the survey! I hope to one day work there, will keep trying!"
"I have worked at JnJ as contractor, have excellent references (Jonathan Walsh) and more and have 15 years in Pharma - to date - no opportunity to work at JnJ.  I am looking forward to a recruiter and opportunity to work at JnJ Full-time."
"I have visited the Johnson  & Johnson website, which is designed to be easy access to every topic the one searching for. I have no complaints on the job description that is been displayed on the career portal of the company and also the other job searching sites. I wish the company a tremendous success in next comming years."
"I have tremendous delivery experience and have worked in digital solutions like IOT, RPA, Analytics.

I don't understand your recruitment process, not even once I got a call and some one tried to understand the capabilities.

By default, after a month I used to get a email that some one considered for this position or position in closed.

If you are not planning to hire from outside, why you are wasting my time. Please be clear.

Thanks,

"• If possible, provide an estimated time frame where JnJ will contact the candidate in the confirmation email. As such, candidates will not impatiently contact JnJ talent acquisition department to bring attention to their application. Reason being that numerous resumes and cover letters need to be screened and filtered, and having candidates calling might not help to facilitate the process.

• A ""review submitted information"" at the end of the application page might help candidates to review possible mistakes made at certain steps."
"[Minor Factor] Keeping applicants/candidates warm within the recruitment process could be improved [i.e. within at least 2-3 days' time, application process updates/feedback could be provided to candidates]."
your recruitment processes is very good. there is no need to improve

You're doing great. Thank you.
You want a survey completed within days of a rejection letter but yet you took weeks to notify me that I was unsuccessful. When communication rejection please don't provide an impersonal generic response. Specifically state why the candidate missed out on an interview. 
You should response a candidate faster about the result of application. 
you should provide attractive salary for freshers also...then only they becom intrested.i intrested in this field and in this company.but you providevery low salary.so i refuse the chance.so pls provide atleast 15000 rupees for fresher
"You should have to update status of applicant such as under review, "
You must inform us about the administration application either you rejected or accepted us.
You must be hiring Ambriel Chang.
You might put the closing date for submitting the application and the expected date for potential candidates will be notified to proceed to the next steps. 
You might as well post the recruitment in Korean.
"You may list down a line at the bottom of the vacancy add , if candidate will not get feedback in 15 working days , he should consider that his/her application has not meet selection criteria or other candidates are more qualified or equipped with right set of skills required for a particular role, This way candidate should not expect any feedback unless being shortlisted or application rejected."
you know best than us...
"You have to schedule an appointment to any potential candidates in order to know whether the candidate is able to work in what they are apply for, if they are not the candidates you are looking for so you can see they're experience for previous job and field of study whether it is suitable placed in a position other than work they're apply for."
"You have to change the recruitment process.
Why should we give you suggestion to improve the recruitment process.
Nothing should be paying to us.
Already company is  paying to your requirement team , they have to look for that the improvement should be done,that's why company is paying for  that, if we give you free advice to improve your process.what is the need of your recruitment team.
If you want a improve your recruitment process you have give some money.

I am professional,sorry for writing this if you hurt sorry for that.

"You have one of the better recruitment processes . So to improve, I would say, you could possibly have more videos with current employees explaining more about the company products and the work environment. You get your additional publicity while potential employees get a better understanding of what they are signing up for"
You have done a good job！
"you have done a good job, I don't have better idea to suggest."
You guys are brilliant. 
You folks had done a great job in simplify the online application process and great to receive this email from you as this shows that you folks are continuously improving your process in view of the ever-changing business environment.

Yet to undergo the entire recruitment process. So for I found it good.  
"Yesterday I received this email: ""Thank you for your interest in Johnson & Johnson Pte. Ltd. At this time, we  have  identified a group of candidates that more closely meets the needs of the business and will not be pursuing your candidacy for this position."" The specific position was indicated nowhere in the email. I applied to several positions with J&J so I have no idea of knowing which one the email is referring to. I checked My Job Page, and the status of each of my applications is not shown there either. This ambiguity should be removed."
"Yes, on process the recruitment."
"Yes, I have a skill in Supply Chain"

"written test , interview  "
Write back quickly whether or not the candidate has been successful or unsuccessful when applying for a job. 
Write 'HR' instead of 'Hr' in the job title :)
"Would like to share a candid feedback:

Reason for rejection of my application within seconds post applying was: my profile doesn't meet requirements.
Am aware that the position I had applied had a clear mention about ""tier-1"" B-school candidate. I believe that was the reason for the rejection of my application.
Despite having a good experience and understanding of supply chain planning, my profile gets rejected just looking at my degree, which is unfair, in my view!
While I agree that the ""tier-1"" MBAs are good,  would like to highlight that non-MBAs or ordinary MBAs are equally deserving and they should also be given a chance.

Anyway, these are my views. Am sure there must be a strong reason for following this process, though it would help if my above feedback is taken into consideration.
Thank you!"
Would like to see more job oportunities.
"Would have been simpler to apply for the position actually on Seek. Like other advertised positions are. Instead of going to Johnson & Johnsons own webpage.

With my varied employment history I have carried out merchandizing displayers in liquor stores, stock control of perishable goods(milk & milk products), Stock rotation , ordering & pricing of stock.

Dealing with ,negotiating on both sides of the fence, so to speak. With Sales consultants and with customers.

If I had been able to apply directly on Seek for the position, I could have submitted the above paragraphs there and then.

Thank you.

I do hope you consider me favourably for the position.

Terrence B Chester        "
Would be nice if we could check the application status online.
"Would be highly appreciable, if the job application status of the candidature is also updated to him. "
Would be great to know the current progress stautus weather the screening is ended or ongoing or will be so the candidate can tell weather they're considered or not. 
Would be good to respond to Candidate within 7 days from receipt of application whether successful or not. 
Would be better if the recruitment process can progress faster.
Would be better if candidate can have prompt feedback about result after submit.
Would appreciate some value added feedback on the application process and some insights rather than an automated email saying we are not pursuing your candidacy for the position at this time. 
"Would  it be better, for an more personal approach. An direct approach, gives a sense of trust and is more straight forward."
Wonder if J&J would keep application/resume for future job match if there is a new position available.  This will shorten the company hiring process and candidate might miss the next opportunity if they do not constantly review new job op. 
Without a discussion I don't understand how you send regret message for a position applied
"Within a few hours of my application I received a rejection email. If you don't have the time to call me and discuss my skills and driving factors don't bother advertising. I do recruitment as it changes people's lives. I like to get to know my applicants for many reasons one main one being, culture fit cannot be seen on paper. Each to their own I suppose. Goodluck with your process."
With trust recruitment
"with email for this survey, JnJ may can also send an sms to candidate asking to fill in the survey. This will help to expedite speedy survey responses."
With clear information for current update status of recruitment and maintain good communication with the candidate for the flow of recruitment
Willing to maximise individuals strength and given opportunities to PMET like me.
"Will need to understand what is the current process of candidate screening from HR stand point ""Screening with work related, # of year experience, education background or just forward all application to Hiring Manager for action"" before comment?"
Will be fair in the hiring process.
"Why i failed to this job
Tell me"
why are you job select in johnson and johnson ?
"While technology is obviously the way to go in this era, I wonder whether a more personal touch would set the company apart. Adding a component that allows candidates to showcase themselves and personalize their application beyond the traditional resume plus cover letter, for example. What about the idea of allowing applicants to add an optional video personal statement? This might combine technology with a more personal touch and would give reviewers the opportunity to see applicants (a sort of pre-interview)"
"While sending the survey link, the company may consider to apprise the candidate of their application status"
"While rejecting online application by talent aquisition team,exact reason must be specify. Exa: Education Qualification is not matched. Or Experience is not inline with job role.Or Expected salary is high. "
"While recognizing that it may not be feasible to provide a human touch due to the sheer volume of applications, it would still be good for candidates to receive some feedback on their application and/or suitability. Given the technology available, one could also create a potential pool of candidates, even if they are unsuccessful now by having a candidate group, e it WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn or via any of such social media platforms.

Thanks"
While it may be difficult for you to reach out to all the candidates who apply - there needs to be a process through which the candidates can be updated and informed of the progress of their application. 
"While I appreciate the effort in finding the right candidate, it is a bit difficult to believe that I have not been shortlisted for a single position I applied for since 2010, and maybe even before,  across the globe. 

Automated No-Reply emails do not throw light on feedback for me. Having worked for over 15 years, it would strange if I had applied to roles , if I knew they were not the right fit. 
Thank You"
"While HR function strives to obtain the right talent for the right place, considering candidature with the right attitude at par with candidature with right ability can be great idea. Since this opens up opportunity for those who have the required qualification as well as number of years experience but have a mismatch between current profile and desired profile. Thank you."
while candidate apply online through company website should have the information weather the post open or not. 
"Whether I was rejected, I would like to know about the result."
Whether an application is accepted or rejected please inform the candidate.
"When u  taking recruitment of u should selct staff from Para Medical. Who is work in ot . Who knows the surgery and how conduting surgery. Its to save camapany time and saving company reputation.

"When the applicant meets all the criteria, sending a generic rejection email doesn't suffice. Especially when dealing with experienced candidates, a feedback/call regarding the details of rejection distinguishes an employer of choice vs the ordinary organisations. I was very disappointed with the recruitment process and the way my application was handled. Organisations need to remember that a candidate applying for the job could be a future employee and they will also be your unpaid brand ambassador, hence the treatment they receive would decide whether they would re-apply or discourage others to apply as well. I would not like to apply again. Thanks Bhavana Sharma, 0426060700, shar.bhavana@gmail.com"
"When Someone apply for any position, employer should conduct the interview for them. I have applied many times for various posts but never got the call for interview. That is why I came to know that recruitment process is not intuitive.

"When I go to the career page (www.careers.jnj.com), type in job reference ""000018J8"", the search results was "" Nothing"". Not all the time, but sometimes."
"When I came to the interview the role was already gone. Still I appreciated the chance to have an interview. After the interview I wrote a thank you e-mail to Head of HR/Recruiter and never heard back, not very polite/professional.I believe communication is key and even if a candidate does not fit one deserves respect - not at least from a employer branding perspective."
"When I applied for the sales executive role in Johnson & Johnson, I didn't got any reply whether I am selected or not for the further process. So i think this improvement can help Johnson & Johnson in recruitment process."
"When filling out the application information, those procedure are somewhat complicated.Hope the procedure can be reduced so that any parties who is interested in the post in Johnson & Johnson fills out the form in a convenience procedure. "
When do recruitment not only look at the Candidates Industry but also look at diversity of the Candidates profile. 
What you could do is to place reviews of people already working at J&J and help explain the work culture of J&J. A video of the work place or interviews with current employees would attract future employees. 
"What would be great from an overall recruitment process standard, would be a candidature tracker for an applicant, to see how far one progressed and if not selected, final reason for elimination."
"What kind of selection procedure is in place here, hr never send a mail or call for interview , all the selection is done by hr favor ism so what is the meaning of submitting the resume on the portal  for the open position.

"
What Johnson & Johnson can do is to immediately set the schedule of the whole application process for the applicant. The recruitment team can often update the applicant regarding the status of the application/
What I believe that johnson & johnson can do to improve their recruitment process is to post their jobs on social media such as on Facebook so as to create awareness to the members of the public
"What a waste recruitment process, not a single mail or call received from the HR team to schedule an interview at least for the fair employment "
"Well.I think the scope of the recruitment of my personal j&j are wide enough. For example, a lot of the best students don't know Johnson & Johnson in the north have fair, compared to the outstanding college students of the university of southern, the students of our north is as good as them. Social skills, learning ability and adaptability, we better. But we have a lot of good students don't know the recruitment time and place for Johnson & Johnson, thus missed a lot of opportunities, thus, Johnson & Johnson lost a lot of excellent employees. Personally, I think the company can increase in the next few years for China's second - and third-tier cities resources occupation, this allows the Johnson &johnson in China, the huge market for larger, more returns.
"
"Well, I am really pleased with this process talent acquisition feedback and my overall experience. According to me existing process is well enough good. Thank you.
"
"Well, hope you guys would hire me soon! =D"
"Well, every organisation having there HR team and they are following the particular process of recruiting. The candidate should try to follow the instructions / process rather than trying to change the system. 

I strongly recommend that before recruiting a person the HR department should be satisfied with the person that he or she will be well capable for the vacant position. "
"Well,  as I have not heard back from Johnson & Johnson re my application for the position , it seems a little strange to be doing a survey at this point .
Maybe send this survey out after the interview or rejection process."
"Well with due respect,  I'm not a human resource manager to give some opinion on it. So instead of answering this question by putting my thoughts which surely, in this case, comes up with the help of the internet, I believe the company does have a better expert who knows much better than me that how they can improve the recruitment process. "
"WELL JOHNSON & JOHNSON HAS A BEST RECRUITMENT PROCESS I GUESS NOTHING MORE TO BE ADDED.


THANK YOU"
Well I am waiting to hear from JNJ about my application. Haven't received any feedback whether my resume is shortlisted. So would request a feedback. 
"Well I am not sure how can you convince candidates about the accountability of the screening process. Matter of fact this is a common problem for the recruitment process itself, not unique to J&J. 
I would love to see you somehow to show people that you process every single application with solid grounds and be fair to select the right candidate with in means of merit and competencies.

Best regard,
Volkan "
"Well done, keep it up."
well done
We will see when I go to the interview.
We use to apply on J & J Website but never getting any positive response till now. Is this process of selecting candidate is transparent. How we can no that this process is not biased. 
"We should get a person touch  from HR through call, to be very clear about JD."
We recommend that the recruitment processing period is not too long so the applicants do not move to other companies
"We received an email acknowledging received of application. But I think it would be very helpful if we are given a clear indication whether it's still processing or already rejected. 
"
"We expect more opportunities to take part in the Campus Career Recruitment of Johnson & Johnson,"
"We are applying for the posts.
But not getting any call
Applied for many vacancies from past 6 months
But no reply. At least why not considering mail is sufficient."
"Was an easy application process. Only question which requires clarification (from memory) is any family member working for a government agency? This should be clarified as to how far reaching family is defined. Ie living in same household or city etc. 
Talent acquisition team member very helpful. However I have not yet had a response as to whether my application was successful or not. It has been approximately 3 weeks since applications closed. "
Walk in Interviews in India to bring transperancy
waiting period for the result of application is too long. Appreciate if the employer could give definite time for the application result.
Waited for 3 weeks for the call from recruitment team but there was no response though followed up several times. Appreciate if the candidate would get a confirmation of the job (either yes/no).
"Video interview was disappointing.

Lack of clear job description given in the day to day duties I would carry out if I was a successful applicant.

No feedback in whether I was successful or not.

Disappointed as I am well experienced in this field and met the application requirements.

I feel being interviewed by phone call by someone overseas and then by video link by someone in Sydney was challenging. 
It was a lengthy, repetitive, unfavourable experience.
For a local employment position I feel like I wasted my time applying for Loans Technician.
The reason being the above mentioned and an opportunity to be interviewed in person.
I valued JnJ credo, and was looking for a company to work for with these values and strengths, so this led to more dissatisfaction will the recruitment process.

uploading of documents need to be easier. perhaps this was because of the process followed by the job portal

update the process immediately  and provide the feedback for the candidate.
Update the applicants on the process of application whether the result is good or bad. 
Update on the recruitment what ever the status it is
Update on the application would be nice. This way we can know if we are short listed or not. 
Update on Job Role status : Filled ? or In the process of evaluation. Thks. 
"Update candidates on the status of their applications within a fortnight, even if they were rejected. More communication is better with less."
"Update applicants as to their application status especially after the phone interview. Because the waiting time of around 2 months is too much. Applicants will easily be dissatisfied and get turned off with the company, which is both negative for the applicant and the company because the applicant will lose trust in the company and the company will lose a potentiatly favorable talent.

Update and give timeline of the recruitment process.
Update about the progress of the application to the applicant.

Thank you."
"Unfortunately, I was never contacted to inform me that we would continue with the process or that I was not a fit for the position. That's why I give it a 7."
"Unfortunately, I was in traffic when I rang to confirm my application.  The recruitment officer acknowledged receipt and then asked if I could do the initial interview.  I should have stopped and asked to perform the interview at a later time as I was not able to concentrate fully on the discussion.  I would only suggest for the recruitment officer to potentially understand the environment the candidate is in and if astute enough, offer to ring back at a later time to ensure the best possible outcome."
"Unfortunately, I cannot participate to the job interview because J&J (Thailand) already selected final candidate. However, job announcement in J&J website has been still available during I applied this position.

Thank you for asking my feedback.

"Understood that there are lots of applicants for one specific position, however, it would be nice the system could send out the notification if the applied position is closed.  Thanks."

"Two Ways To Improve Your Hiring Process.
1. In order for the recruiting process to improve, The hiring process needs to be adaptable and new every single time. You can think of the hiring process a bit like the weather: constantly changing and requiring us to put on our sunglasses, get out our umbrellas, or  in extreme cases,  take cover! Much like checking on the weather before starting your day, you should be constantly checking on your hiring process to make sure it matches the current climate. You can’t rely on a one-size-fits-all approach and expect the best results.
2. Technologies such as Skype need to be utilized by company to grasp larger, more remote talent pools. By doing so, top talent can become more accessible to organizations."
Two way communication between the employer and employee is very important part to get a efficiency result. thanks you 
"Try to provide more exciting job roles for freshers also so that conpany can get fresh talent to explore.

Try to make it simple and quick.
Try to make a digital form for recruitment in order to make sure if the company have received our application
Try to maintain walkins in india
Try not to rely on AI to screen application. 
Try new people with different skills
"Try making little adjustments throughout your selection and hiring processes and see how it impacts your candidates’ perception of your employer recruitment brand: new technology, sourcing and recruiting tactics, a changing economy, and many other recruiting variables mean your recruiting goals have to include continuous improvement. You need to measure the effectiveness in your recruiting process to improve it.
"
Try contact the recruits directly by phone or arrange for video call.
trim down the basic requirements when it comes to educational and personal capabilities
"Trends nowadays with regards to talent acquisition is not just by recruiting people through employer branding but by customer feedback inside and outside of the company. Through good service and passionate work etiquette, talent acquisition will surely be propelling to a new heights of success"
"Transparency- If the application is rejected, you should add the reason of why that decision is taken in the concern mail. "
"Transparency, contact to candidate to let the candidate know whether the application is going through or being rejected. Information on how long the reviewing process. Once the time has passed, the candidate will know that he/she is not considered further in the recruitment process.

"To start, this was my only encounter with J&J healthcare in Australia with the  HR team. I'm sure this isn't a reflection of J&J business in Australasia.

Your recruiter Jon Fallon based in Sydney, Australia agreed to follow up on a 20 minute interview as timing of his call wasn't suitable to me. We agreed he would call me back at a set time (Monday 20 February at 12.30pm), but he never did. I have left him subsequent voice mails for the following days and week, but he never returned my call. Not even to say if they decided not to pursue the opportunity with me (RSM Spine & Codman VIC/TAS). "

IMHO:
1. Applying software/application with advance state of the art logarithm in screening and selecting through numerous resume with ease.
2. Reduce the time length during screening period, therefore leads to efficient use of time. Time is priceless.

Hopefully these humble opinions​ of mine could beneficial for the survey.

Those who have uploaded their CV in the official site of Johnson &  Johnson should be regularly informed through mail about the vaccacies  whenever there is one.
This type of recruitment is enough otherwise who are all applying interest candidate kindly contact and attend the interview.
"This survey mail should come as quickly as possible, ideally the same time or day after applying for the profile."
"this server is better to improve the recruitment process, but if you add the personality survey questions then you get better results. "
This section requires more times which I am not prepared to invest due to my busy daily schedule now.
"This recruitment type of process with Johnson and Johnson is my first experience I have run through. With this process the Company will be able to understand the applicant's expectations and level of knowledge about Johnson and Johnson.
In order to improve online recruitment process, J & J  needs to provide more information regarding next step after this survey. Thank you."
This process is very impressive and I have never experience before.  This is a great process and also help to enlightening company reputation.   
"This process is unique 
I have not come across with process like this to comment"
This process is nice . 
"This process is good but the weekness if the applicant do not have update email so.they miss the info from J &J. It will be better calling by the team saying  that application letetr is rcvd and will be provide and do futher interview if meet the requirment.
"
This process is good
"This post job application survey, while interesting in itself, might solicit slanted responses or intentions from the respondents who expressed keenness in J&J position. Good effort of J&J to reach out to potential candidates, and collect data to improve the recruitment process. This does enhance the 'customer' experience in our engagement with J&J. "
This making me feel good. Taking feedback from an applicant is good experience. Generally these surveys are sent to selected candidates to understand their experience throughout the recruitment process. This is different and already feel good about it.
This is very good recruitment procedure 
"this is very good process , this is the first time in my carrier that if we have apply for job then after company taking a feedback from the job seekers which is selected or not ,

but company want to improve hiring process throw this activity .

thnks "
This is the survey after my application few days ago. Not able to give any comment here. Thanks
"This is the good recruitment procedure followed by your reputed organization and if candidate is shortlisted in your design criteria, immediately proceed the further process instead of taking long time."
This is the first time I applied with J&J so I can't tell yet as I am still on Stage 1 (that is submission of my CV online)
This is the first time i am applying and impressed to hear a survey email with in 3 days of application submission.
this is the best way
"This is the best survey process I found but, if add the supervisory responsibility and physical demand and working condition in this survey then I think it will be little bit improve the survey standard of company."
This is the best recruitment process i have seen in my career. i wish i would be a part of this organization to improve mine as well as company's personality.
this is the best process system I have seen . No more comment . 
"This is my opinion:

I'm never process interview and selection, my opinion:

there an applicants who will join Johnson& Johnson should be process based on their experiences and interest without connection/relations top persons in the company."
"This is my first time to apply the role. I just passed intial step of the pricess though, it is appreciated to hear comment, notification as next step even in case application is denied."
"This is my first time to apply in your company, so I think I'm still not in the position to give comment or reaction on how your recruitment process was done. Perhaps, if I will be considered as one of your finalist for the position within a couple of days/weeks, then it will be an honor to say the outcome of how the process goes."
"This is my first application to J&J, so cant say anything. "
"This is my first application at J&J ,when I will go through the process after wards it worth of giving suggestions regarding recruiting process."
This is Good & better way to recruit the rug candidate.
"This is crucial for a recruiting process that’s looking for candidates with technical skills, or a strong background or experience. Sadly, people like and stretch things on their resumes, creating difficulty to the process and to the company after the initial hire. Growth and development are important to young professionals, who might not have it all already and who value an employer that values its employees and their professional growth."
"This is an ongoing process , an I believe , It's in line with the best practices available, "
This is an excellent process. 
"This is an excellent process, however more description of requirement could be given and applicant's expectation be asked.

This is also a good procedure that Johnson & Johnson provide this survey for employee. but this is a lengthy process. Johnson & Johnson may also recruit via telephonic interview.
this is a good form of acknowledgment from Johnson & Johnson to let the candidate knows that the application is been attended.
this feedback is only applicable once the recruitment process is complete.
This esteemed organization does not need any improvement as it is getting better and advanced Everytime
"They the way approaching candidate in this field itself and they haven't capable enough to continue with this organisation and they have look for candidate though this kind of process direct recruitment, so that they can do well in all aspects after that they need to verify about his past company experiences..if a person from cardiac team they will definitely do well in diabetics also so they have to select those candidate from other specialty too.."
They should work on hiring   experience  professionals. 
"They should short list candidates  not only by considering CV but also call for an formal interview(either telephonic or face to face). Only those have more than 10 years experience working in UAE. I strongly believe that those who has experience in any industry can catch up with a small training. But nobody in the talent acquisition team is bother to do it and will always stick to short list only candidates with work experience in the same field.

I am sure that looking into CV wont get the full reflection of the candidates quality as CV can be prepare by professional CV makers assistance. 
Hope your team will consider my review on this aspect

They should provide opportunities to cross department people also who are capable enough. 
They should provide openings for fresher so they get good platform.
They Should ask candidate for a personal interview & know their strength & Weakness & Ask their Interest & passion Accordingly give them a chance to work with your esteemed Organisation.
"They should also recruit through the online submitted  applications because it may happen that some of the skilled and talented candidates  are there also.

And also company should give chance to work to freshers candidates also because a fresher candidate do his work the work effectively & efficiently to save his job otherwise he or she will be terminated. 

Until  and unless a fresher candidates will not get the chance to work in a reputed  company how will he or she becomes experienced candidates. "
They never mention upfront but seems like J&J never want to sponsor work permit and recruit from other countries. Be specific and upfront guys.
They need to make the processing faster.
They may include the voice chating and may also use SKYPE for recruitment process.
"They have to look the candidates CV after that they want to make a telephonic round if they are satisfied, they can approach for further level, and also should look a candidate for the location whom will know well about the city or Territory market. Whom will know well about the location. "
They could get back a bit sooner regarding the job and perhaps have a contact number so people could follow up.  
They can run analytics of past employees hired with their background to check for similarities and finding patterns.
They can make a social networking group to get the attention of more suitable and efficient candidates for better recruitment process.
They can improve the website because it is a bit confusing at first in terms of finding positions in certain areas. The rest so far is good and well organized. Hope to moved further on this job process. 
They can improve the recruitment process by going to the career fairs in the schools in the metro and provinces so they can have a more diversified pool of employees committed to excellence.
They can develop a short online assessment test to actually see if a position matches to applicants.
They can be more proactive and fast in processing the applications
They can atleast give chance to the applicant for an interview to see their capabilities that sometimes is not visible or not justified by the curriculum vitae.
They are working good for requirement.
"there's nothing to improve, everything went fine for me! "
"There was no follow up from recruitment team about the outcome after the interview although it has been more than a month and it is presumably unsuccessful. 

The hiring manager was late for the interview and answered a few work related phone calls throughout the interview. He did apologise for the interruptions as he had to deal with an impromptu situation. 

As for the job fit, the hiring manager gave a strong impression that prior background and experience from a particular industry was vital to the role I was applying for. I was quite disappointed as I felt that I was called for the interview due to having the right skill sets and was being considered even though I was from a different industry. 

This was probably a result of lack of communication between hiring manager and recruitment team."
There was no feedback for rejecting and I believe my resume was not properly screened by HR staff. 
There should be telephonic round with the candidate to understand the profile of the prospective candidate.
There should be more defined job description.
There should be clearer process with timelines.
There should be an option online where we can see our job application status.
There should be a very friendly atmosphere so that the employee feel comfortable.
"There should be a time bound response to every application submitted so that a person's hope does not turn into despair after waiting for long. 

Also, any person having minimum eligibility requirements should at least be given a chance of telephonic interview. "
There should be a local process for hiring to know more about the reputation of the candidate as well as his Knowledge skills ability and aptitude to handle such tasks.
"There should be a follow-up message after application; the automatic sentence makes it a bit cold and not knowing what's J&J review me as a candidate.
"
There should be a contact point where applicants can get information directly like there should be a dedication phone number or email address by which we can reach to you talent team and get reply to our queries within minimum time.
There must be direct information Import from LinkedIn which was not working properly and may have option to pick it from about section of facebook
There must be a system where an applicant can log in for the vacant positions available.
"There is only one thing i wanted to in a recruitment process to avoid the intuitive approach. Give a test to candidates and the result will tell you if he/she has a good ability. Do not rely on graduates of reputable schools because those can't afford are much dedicated, motivated and goal oriented people."
"THERE IS NOTHING TO IMPROVE, EVERY FINE"
There is nothing more to improve in the recruitment process because all needed informations of the applicants were already supplied with the recruitment team.
There is no problem on the recruit process at this point. 
"there is no need to improve the recrutiment process. It's a quite good process in time, equality, and fairness."
"There is no need to change anything, everything is fine
"
"There is no need for any improvement in recruitment process, becouse recruitment process is very easy and convenient."
There is an extremely transparent recruitment structure is place which shows the level of professionalism at JnJ. Would really love to a part of this beautiful culture
"There is an automated mail to acknowledge receipt of job application, which is excellent. Thereafter, there is no follow-up on the outcome of the application.

It will be great to be kept informed of the outcome regardless of whether there is a fit or not. This will definitely help to maintain or enhance J&J employer brand image. Hope this feedback is helpful."
"There is always room for improvements in any sector highly dependent upon needs, transparency and specific requirements ."
There is always a place at the TOP. Recruitment process can be more faster. Since Johnson & Johnson is world class organization and people love to work with this organization.I am one of them.
There is a clear application status information from each applicant to dispel doubts and uncertainties for each selection process. Either direct to applicant personal email or available on company website.
There could be a clearer indication on web or by mail for an applier in which state of the acquisition process does the applier belongs to as of the time.  And the response time limit for the job poster to respond if decision was no go.  Last time I had to spend 3 weeks without any response from the system or HR coordinator and the answer was no.  It was very much disappointing.
There aren't any improvements that I could.think of at the moment.
"There are some suggestions:
1. Give some information about the due date in each stage of recruitment process.
2. Written test or interview can be conducted in the online test."
"There are a lot of people who excel both on paper as well as during the interview. However after being accepted, the company soon realised that their expectations does not match up.

Therefore I believe that the current style of of recruitment is obsolete.

I believe the candidate should be put in an environment that they will eventually demonstrate their genuine character and capability. For example having the candidate organise a dinner event for the interview panel. For higher volume recruitment, the company can organise a 1 week boot camp environment where the candidates are made to perform certain tasks and the hiring managers then observe for the character traits and behaviour and problem solving skills that they are looking for. 

All who applied should be invited and after the boot camp then comes the formal interview. I believe through this method, both the future employee and employer can have a taste of how working life is going to be in your company. The employee may think it's not their cup of tea and choose to withdraw their application or the employer may find them suitable or unsuitable. 


"
The wechat could be more customization like interaction with recruiters
"The website was hard to navigate to find my position that i applied. Seraching the opportunity was hard. 

The description was straight forward to understand my roles which makes me to jump into this challenge. "
"The website used to submit the application had a lot of technical issues.  I had attempted to attach my CV many times, but it kept showing an error, so I had to keep trying the link, logging in and out several times.  It took more than an hour for me to successfully attach a CV after many attempts before I could complete the application process."
The website of recruitment must be easier 
The website could be more user friendly in terms of local vacancies. 
"The web based application recruitment is efficient. Its a new and efficient way to gather necessary information from the candidate/s. I would suggest for Johnson & Johnson to probably have a 'contact HR' link to be redirected to an email or a repository where recruitment team can check and respond as needed. Candidates can send queries or concerns if they have clarifications in some of the questions. Given that the recruitment process has been integrated virtually, some candidates would probably need to consult something to the recruitment team (conventional way). "
"The way of putting up the job description of Johnson & Johnson is excellent. The role sometimes can be more specific. But gone through many recruitment process, I have heard that the process of Johnson & Johnson's is the most challenging and worthy."
"The usual process is good but maybe a quicker response to the candidates on a real-time basis as soon as the application is received and it is being viewed is essential.

Making calls to the candidates to discuss & understand their profile better and getting to know their expectations & future prospects with the company is a good way to add a personal touch to all applicants.

It will help the Recruiter to understand the candidate's behaviour and response better. Also the candidate will be more comfortable and will get a positive outlook about J&J as a organisation to build their future with."
The timeline of the hiring process. Notice for both successfull and unsuccessfull applications.
"The time between some steps does seem quite lengthy i.e. when reference check and psychometric testing have been completed, there is still some time that passes after this.

Overall I have found the process has run very smoothly and a high level of communication does exist within this process."
The system must allow the online users to successfully attach their updated resume in your database. 
The system is not intuitive to allow the candidate to manage the profile for application and it's quite confusing. 
The submission of my application went by smoothly. 
The standard recruitment process already provides essential information. It seems that the team takes careful consideration upon each candidate's qualification so it may take some time to process the applications. However it would be great to speed up the process. 
"The skills and competencies of these candidates may potentially best fit in other job vacancies within the same establishment, instead of losing a good candidate due to R&R mismatch, is there a platform to round up these candidates where similarly they are opened to work in other roles."
"The selection of the candidate based on gained experiences, less into intuitive process which this will help to open more opportunity for season employees.
"
"The Role of Sr Manager - Lens Extraction was not  clear. It was mention 12 years experience.Is it 12 years experience as Man management Role or the overall experience in the industry or in the same field. The more specific means more in depth idea on what is looking for. That's my honest feelings.

"
"The role for the Manager, Consumer Experience And Innovation didn't have the qualifications setup

The candidates weren't aware or informed if he or she is rejected and the status on the site doesn't update the candidacy 

If the candidate is rejected , they should get a proper response to follow through "
"The role as advertised was almost a perfect fit with my experience, however after first round phone interviews it was decided that the description was not bringing in senior enough candidates. "
The resume of the candidate can be directly submitted.
"The resume is downloaded from a job portal Naukri.com, I got the information from the Naukri portal that my resume is under consideration.
I am very excited to work with Johnson & Johnson."
The Resume can be considered for other position and candidate might be ready for new role and tasks.
"The result of screening could be updated by email, though I am waiting for interview call.
Update on status of my application could help."
The responses for an application should be sent faster.
The response time for the evaluation can be improved a lot. As I have applied on 14th Feb and haven't received any response from the team yet.
"The response period can be shorten and also, I would appreciate if reasons, or feedback can be given to candidate on areas where he or she did not meet the requirement."
The recruitment team should give feedback to the applicants not just good news but also the news if the applicants are failed to meet the competencies.
"The Recruitment Team may opt to create quick online tests for personality and skills compatibility, to best filter and select applicants for the position."
The recruitment system is actually good and user friendly
The recruitment system did not allow for a preview button and it wasn't clear when the last step was. It's easy to accidentally submit by clicking next and no option to withdraw application or contact person to edit application once accidentally submitted.
The recruitment process was very efficient and thorough. It was one of the best.  
"The recruitment process was really simple and easy to follow, the only improvement might be the time waiting to hear from Jonhson & Johnson on where the application status stand.  My suggestion might be having a page where the applicants can check the status of the applications.  Thank you for your time."
"The recruitment process was quite intuitive and the job description including the R&R, skills was clearly explained. But I would like to discover the lead period for each selection as well in the recruitment process."
the recruitment process should not take a long time so that applicants can know certainty the time required in the selection process.
The Recruitment process should not be a lengthy time frame. 
The recruitment process should be simpler and faster.
The recruitment process should be made faster .
"The recruitment process should be in minimum time period.
The recruitment process is appreciable."
The recruitment process should be faster. 
The recruitment process should be fast. 
"The recruitment process should be completed in a short span of time,"
The Recruitment process should be bit faster..
"The recruitment process should be able to attract competent applicants for companies with good experience and knowledge skills, and also match between job demands with knowledge and motivation that tend to fit the applicant's personality."
The recruitment process requires not much but more exposure and chance to the freshers or post graduates. May be some training programs may help. The recruitment procedures are fair enough.
"The recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson is very transparent, so I think you should maintain this process."
The recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson is great.
"The Recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson is already very good.Still there are lots of ways to improov the recruitment process.
1-Screen out the best candidate after going through with the resume.
2-Is the candidate is best fit for our profile?
3-we can organise different types of pool campus to find the one of the best candidate for us.
"
The recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson is already great. But a more broad profiling test will be more advantageous for the company.
"The recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson has been running smoothly. Per experience and observation, the talent acquisition spend two to three weeks to decide on a ""pass/fail"" candidate selection which can be improved if the HR team install proper guidelines such as setting deadline on the submission of applicants' resume. Also, creating a FAQ page on the careers site to help support the idea that your employment brand conveys helpfulness and transparency. Moreover, it helps to cut down on the number of applicant questions you may receive during the hiring process and that helps you save time and process employment applications more quickly. "
The recruitment process may be faster.
The recruitment process itself is thorough and skills oriented. Maybe one improvement could be to establish quicker information dissemination to new/prospective hires or maybe there could be a chance or meeting to engage fellow new hires and/or members of the team/managers in order to gain an initial insight of what is going to happen before day 1 of work
The recruitment process is very thorough and straight forward as it is. A recommended improvement may be to include type of shifts and working hours offered in the job description. 
"the recruitment process is very systematic, and I thought it was good. but the person who was in charge of our department was not well. she took a long time to post a job description more than 10 days, she forgot to do it? and after the interview, she again forgot making offer letter more than 1week. it was really tiring."
The recruitment process is very systematic & good.
The recruitment process is very good. But I think it would be better if the recruitment process is done in a simple way and doesn't take much time. 
The recruitment process is very good as of now. Very good communication is maintained. 
The recruitment process is user-friendly and but could have given the notification to applicants at a faster rate. Thanks.
"The recruitment process is user friendly however, it should be more faster. "
The recruitment process is quite clear and intuitive.
"The recruitment process is nearly perfect cause they offer survey before an actual feedback and interview. With that, they will be able to know what's the interest and views of the applicant for the company. I would be so glad if they will hire me cause for me Johnson & Johnson is a perfect company to showcase my skills & capabilities. "
"The recruitment process is in place, because it takes management to get through all the necessary process needed to get the recruitment right, so the only suggestion I can made is time frame."
The recruitment process is good.
The recruitment process is extremely awesome. I believe the recruitment team is doing great. :)
The recruitment process is excellent.
The recruitment process is easy and simple and any candidate can be easily go though it and apply based on their choices.
The recruitment process is designed very logically and practically. I found everybody in the hierarchy intervened at the right time (step-up) with practical set of questions. The system is already robust.
The recruitment process is comprehensive. 
The recruitment process is clear and well-structured. Appreciate if applicants are allowed to check their application status from time to time. Thank you.
"The recruitment process is amongst the standard recruitment process throughout the industry. This can rectify employee credential and key skills well before recruitment.

No necessary improvement required."
"The recruitment process is already very good, thank you."
The recruitment process is already in a good format it is just that a little bit of change is always good. A bit of more direct approach to the company might help a bit. 
"The recruitment process is already good, however the feedback is not quite fast."
the recruitment process is already efficient.
The recruitment process is all okay and timely enough.
The recruitment process I think is already good
The recruitment process can't be better.
The recruitment process can provide more job position in subordinaries branches such as Jenssen. 
the recruitment process can be improved by fastening the process about candidate selection by informing them about how to go about in the future
The recruitment process can be improve by letting the candidate know that if he/she is shortlisted by sending a courtesy email. 
The recruitment process by J&J is one of the best in the market. We were one of the dealer of the company and always positive views we used to get from the one associated with the company.
The recruitment process at Johnson & Johnson already seems to be seamless so there's nothing I can see to be improved or enhanced.
The recruitment personnel who conducted my initial interview informed me that if I qualified they will get back for another call. Have not heard anything after that. I hope a follow thru will be good. At least we know what the status of our application. Never heard anything after that and up to this day I still don't know if I failed or not.
The recruitment consultant (Nikkie Ramos) email me to check convenient time for a phone interview. I advised Monday. On Monday I was waiting for the call and never heard from him. Nikkie then calls me on Tuesday during my work hours. I ask if he could call me back in 30 mins and that was it never heard from him. I think I'm being disadvantage in recruitment process. 
"the recruiter need to :
Make being responsive to candidates a priority , Be truly prepared to interview your candidates , making a blog ,Keep your finalists close even if they aren’t selected , Proactively check in with previous applicants , Survey applicants for input to improve your recruiting process . need to and very much need"
The re recruitment process is good
The questions can be further simplify and concise for Asia applicants
The progress is feeling smooth and no need for any improvement 
The profession of the Interviewee should thoroughly on professional grounds. At higher experience the company should highlight the road map of growth to the candidates.
The processing time of application should be more faster than the usual time
the processing length should have been indicated for a better applicant experience
"The process was smooth and user friendly, it's automatic and accurate. "
"The process was smooth and I received direct feedback from the recruiter within 5 days after my application.This shows the efficiency of the hiring process and the dedication for people within your organization. 
Even I was not considered for this role this time, I will apply again for future similar opportunities, and will definitely visit J&J career website on regular basis.
Thanks for your support!"
The process was quite smooth and user friendly.acknowledgement of application was recd immidiately after applying.The only thing that i would suggest is to kindly send the applicants a personal feedback and status of their application as the same would keep the candidates interested.
"The process was quite smooth and intuitive. It was a pleasant experience. 

I came to know about this role through a friend who has received an alert from a job portal. Candidates with relevant profile may be directly reached out through LinkedIn and other similar portals. 

A status  wise update may also be shared with candidates.
"
"The process was lucid and user friendly. I cannot think of anything at the moment for improvement as the current process seems adequately efficient for Talent acquisition.
"
"The process was extremely long and drawn out, from final interview to the offer. This could have been a lot quicker. "
"The process so far, has been a good experience, as I haven't had wait long, to hear back from you.
Looking forward to the next step of the way nterview. "
The process so far managed very well
The process should include questions that wll best describe the applicant's strengths and weaknesses and show his/her fitness for the position. 
The process should be more quickly.
"The process seems really professional and one of the best i have gone through as a candidate. I like the concept of conducting surveys however with all due respect, i feel make ""being responsive"" to candidates a priority. For example, its been over a few weeks that i had applied for this role. However, havent really got a yes or a no from the company/ recruiter yet. Rest its all good. 
Thank you. "
"The process overall was very professional so far, compared to the other firms."
The process of recruitment is good.
The process of J and J is good for recruitment. So from my side there is nothing any suggestion. 
"The process of application was smooth and straightforward. To aid applicants interested in the role better manage their expectations, I would recommend that a closing date for the role and indication of when successful candidates will be notified be indicated on either the role description or follow-up correspondence. "
The process needs to be cut short and should be more focused on evaluation of the competencies suitable for the job profile.
The process looks smart in line with market trends.
The process is well planned and executed. No changes is required. 
The process is very opaque. The updates are not timely. Neither hiring manager nor recruiter communicate outcomes decisions lucidly and clearly with reasons.
the process is unto the mark.
The process is streamlined and very efficient. 
The process is straightforward.I don't have any problems with it 
The process is simple in the web app and there is a notification if it is not accepted
The process is relatively simple and user friendly for any applicant to navigate through. 
The process is properly updated as per the current scenario. 
"The process is overall good,but i guess its taking too much time."
The process is just perfect. Thank you
The process is gud .. my be let the appilicant know the status of application
The process is good. Speed of response can be improved in my view
The process is already very user friendly and informative.
The process is already very user friendly and informative.
The process is already up to the mark improvised. 
"The process is already pretty good, still I think after applying once, those who are not selected, their resumes should keep properly in the HR database and receive alerts when any other matching opening comes in near future."
The process for reaching out to employer was simple. I would like to connect to real people working for J&J and get a chance to learn from them. Looking forward to meet and learn.
The process followed it up-to-date.
The process followed is appropriate.
The process could be bit more transparent about if or when the candidate can expect to be contacted after applying for a position. If the vacancy still remains or if the application is for some distant probable possibility. 
The process can run faster. 
"The process can be a little shorter. Expect a revert from the concerned person regarding the applied job & also whether the profile is considered for the role or not.
Even if the profile is not considered, it should be communicated via email so that we stop expecting the reply & carry on with job search.

Thanks & Regards,

Rupal Trivedi
 "
The process by J&J is good no further suggestion to improve according to my best view.
"The present process is seems to be good, but to make it simple where give only the major information of the applicant "
The present process is perfect...
The person applying for job should be able to track exact status of application. 
The person applying for a job should be informed even if her/his profile is not shortlisted.
The page be made more appealing.
The overall
"The organisation can create awareness among probable talents through electronic, social or mass media programs ""connect with Johnson & Johnson"". 
 It will also create brand image and product publicity."
"The only thing which was noticed was that, the job application sent did not have any response. It is suggested that even if the profile does not suit the role, it would be great to receive a communication."
"The only improvement I would consider would be ( and I know it can be time consuming ) would be feedback as to reasoning for unsuccessful application . IE: skill set was not sufficient, times available were not conducive of the companies needs etc . "
"The only feedback I can provide, is it would be nice to receive an update on the application process or quicker response window responding to applications.
"
The online system is quite complicated to a new user as some online website may provide some easy instructions to the applicants.
"The online recruitment process is tedious and can still be simplified/ shorten. Currently the questions contain too much ""technical"" questions and doesnt really help the company identified the kind of candidates with similar values as the company (if that's of interest to Johnson & Johnson).

Hope that helps. 

Regards, Saw Gin 

 "
"The online process is user friendly, communication on the interview can be made faster. "
"The online application process is a breeze, no hassle, simple to use and all data collections are appropriate ad relevant. Kudos for the good job. "
"The online application is very convenient for applicants.
However, it is my pleasure to comment further if I have an opportunity to go through the complete recruitment process.
Thank you."
"The online application form did not allow me to view an overview of form requirements such as essays and documens. I had to click through the pages of the form and put in dummy information with the intent of completing the essays questions later. Towards the end there was no warning that i was on the final page and my application would be submitted simply by clicking ""next"". There was no request for confirmation and my incomplete application was submitted. I am disappointed that my incomplete aplication would likely be viewed unfavouably by J&J recruiters when my intent of stepping through the application was so I could prepare thoughtful responses. To remedy this problem you could provide an overview of the form at the first page or you could introduce a warning box that indicates ""next"" means submit."
The one of the best. 
the one I applied is for Accounts Payable but I was interviewed for Intercompany post.
The number of interviews and processing time before offering the advertised position would be appreciated.
"The manager itself should be the one to conduct the interview not your ""soon to be colleagues"" to determine which one fits the role. "
"The major steps has been already considered. So nothing to  suggest about. 


"
The login process is very big which consumes too much time
The link from jobstreet will be better if directly to the job post you are applying and not to the main page of jnj. Thank you.
The least J&J can do is to get back to an applicant to let him/her know about the status of the application. I haven't received any call or email from your side about the status of my application. I'm still taking this survey because I like to treat others in a way I'd like to be treated. I hope you can improve on that aspect. Selecting the right candidate from the list of applicants is one part. Maintaining a good relationship with the other applicants (who will one day be your customers) is more important. 
"The Johnson & Johnson is Good Origination .
The recruitment process should be fast as compare to others .
and very friendly nature to add the requiters to company profile .

The job vacancy process could be explained in the first page include the timeline is favorable
"The job posting can be made more informative regarding the specific set of skills and talents required , other than that the procedure and everything else is easy and helpful.
thank you"
"The job discription was mentioned in one way in the process of recruiment by HR but when I join company, the job is in another way. It different from the way HR has told, just a tactics of HR to minimize the offer salary. That means I agreed with the offer for job, but in reality I have more roles. Maybe I feel HR is a liar."
The job application process is fairly straightforward and user friendly. 
"The J&J recruitment process is already very streamlined and easy to use.  The videos, career milestones and personal sharing of existing employees is a great idea and makes a compelling employee value proposition.  "
The interview process takes a long time . It would be really helpful if the process is completed within a shorter period of time 
"The interview process is bit too long, time should be managed"
The interview process is best among other and it should be much more effective for all round progress of employee.
The interval time between one stage to the next stage of process should be more efficient
"The interface provided by Johnson and Johnson for recruitment was user friendly so i really had no technical issue while applying, the only concern is candidate should receive response of their selection or rejection in clear words."
"The initial telecon interview scheduled but recieved call 15 min late ( may be due to tech team busy in another task), after HR given next day schedule but interview didn't happened. Expecting prompt response so that candidature also have clear understanding on his selection."
"The information was clear and concise.The search engine was quiet useful to me. If one of the main objectives is to increase the number of application, the use of social media might be effective. In my case in specific, the use of Facebook ads with a specific target audience (University student or graduated in Taipei or Taiwan). The social media platforms with most users in Taiwan are YouTube, Facebook and Line. I found the application through Google search engine. Hopefully it's helpful."
The information I heard about Johnson and Johnson is great. That's the reason behind applying in this company 
The improvement which can be done in recruitment process is by stated clearly about the recruitment timeline and the document needed on the application
The HR department can reply to the candidate faster and give the test for them.
"The hiring process needs a lot of improvement. There is no feedback or any aggressiveness from the HR in getting in touch with the applicants. Hiring process needs review and improvement. 

Thanks!"
The feed back after application sent candidate who apply need more faster than current.
The extraction of the CV content to the application can be better coded. The formatting runs presently.
The entire process of application was quite fluid. So no major improvement feedback. 
"The employment site should be user friendly, most of the time application may not have time to fill up every details required in your application since, the same information is in the resume.  Design should be consistent with user experience"
The duration for requirements process
The design of the website is very friendly and easy to engage.  Candidates will be very impress should there be a clear feedback loop advising about the situation of the recruitment and where the case is currently.
The current system is concise and satisfactory. The system is precisely made to avoid duplication of entering information which is already there in resume. Overall the application process is satisfactory
The current recruitment process seems to be designed well. In my opinion it would be helpful if there was a opportunity to submit/upload additional supporting documents. eg- Certificates/Employer reference etc. 
"The current recruitment process is very intuitive and perfect for me.

1. I can find new jobs from Johnson & Johnson's website.
2. From the description of this role,  I know what skills and competencies is needed to be successful.
3. The brief anonymous survey lets me know that my resume has been viewed.Because the waiting time is very long.

Now I'm looking forward to joining Johnson & Johnson."
"The current recruitment process is subtle. But in case of rejecting the candidate, the basis of rejection must be communicated for future betterment"
"The current recruitment process is amongst the best and my this assessment is based on wide experience on current recruitment environment.  

Thank you Johnson & Johnson, respectfully.  "
"The current process was quite up to the mark, however if the appearance of the application on the screen (User interface) could be made much easier and attractive.
Eg:- Some of the information was improperly arranged and was missed by me, I filled it only after I was not allowed to move to next page by a pop-up.

Thanks"
The current process is good to use already.
The current process is fairly comprehensive. Have not faced any major hurdles yet.
"The current process is already very good. All the process and thennext steps are always explained by the hr team. All correspondence is clear. I also do like the fact that I get a call first then I get the email correspondence to the subject that was just discussed. 
I feel that hiring process for J&J is top notch! May Cheo was exceptional!  "
"the current process appears to work well, the most important factor is to provide prompt feedback to candidates "
"The current procedure is also good but it is also improve by depute a separate team for recruitment, who look after the  application on daily basis, short out the same & arrange the interview when there is morethan sufficient candidates also technical questionnaire should be provided on site during application."
The current procedure is actually lined to a very unique and latest recruitment process. User-friendly and perfectly understandable. I am already satisfied.
"The current jd is detailed and provides a clear understanding of the job scope and requirements. But if there is something more that can help job seekers make an informed decision, could have an online ""live chat"" personnel to answer our questions, of course that will be if there are no constraints or limitations in terms of resources.  "
The current is better but need to provide update on the results as soon as possible
The current arrangement is good but could be better if the review process could be shorten. 
"The company should go to premier institutes of the India (IITs, NITs, IISERs..etc) and should do the campus placement to hire talented students."
The company should consider other candidates having rich experience during internship and it might also consider to recruit through CA campus placement.
The company should be consistent in providing feedback to their candidates whether successful or not.
The company select the right candidates.To collect proper information  about requirement of the job skill that are important  asking the perfect questions in an interview  and collecting too little information about the candidates. 
The company needs to improve the recruitment process by making a goal to contact the applicant within a week either via email or phone.
"The company must do the following:

Add More Detail to Your Job Postings.
Include Others.
Don't Be Afraid to Test Candidates.
Ensure the Process is Consistent with All Applicants.
Emphasize Growth and Development."
"The company must arrange walk-in interview for fresher and experience candidates.so that everyone get opportunity to get job in his/her dream company.
"
The Company Jhonson & Jhonson has great reputation globally & this is enough for myself to work with a renouned organisation.As far as long perceiverence is concerned this particular organisation is a great place to work with. 
"The Company have to call for the interview and assess the person  in the  professional way as how far the candidate was suitable for our environment and in what way he will develop our organisation. 

The company can conduct the written test and one to one interview for the filtering the correct candidate.   "
The company has to continue tha brand and quality 
"The Company has a very extensive and well thought-of recruitment process in the company web site and on the job advertisement sites. I just do hope that you would prioritize applicants from these sources.

Thank you very much."
"The company can set a timeframe for getting back to the candidates. This allows the candidates to have a better gauge of their job application status, shall they be contacted or not be contacted after the specified timeframe."
The company can post more ads and job listings on various websites and social media outlets as these are great outlets for possible applicants to view.
The company can organise the written test for recruitment  to shortlist competent candidate.
The company can give an opportunity for the candidate to present themselves on the reason and the rationale for applying this job.
The company can give a clear timeline of the recruitment process and update the progress on social media using official account of Johnson & Johnson.
"The careers page has duplicate webpages. After applying using my CV was not updated in the system when i checked back on my submission, it was still using what i uploaded 1-2 years back.

There should be some response with regards to rejection and the basis of selection should not be purely based on the numerical value of the number of years of experience."
the career path must be shown clearly as the opportunity appears with detailed descriptions
The candidate should send his CV or Linkedin data to the recruiter without fill the same data that duplicate with the CV or data in Linkedin
The candidate shall be subjected to entire recruitment process
"the best thing is when you hired me, because i have so much expectation working at jj, the recruitment process through internet is hilarious but i think seeing one on one is the best way."
The auto-response was a good form of assurance that my application was well  received and this follow-up survey is also a very good indicator of how considerate the company is of people who take interest in the company.
"the approach to an appropriate candidate is a must, in a while i have only seen this email and acknowledgement mail as a confirmation  , however there is no phone call as of now...what i mean is if the candidature is as per the requirement a quick polite refusal on acceptance on the candidature can help candidate to take the company , job posting or even the selection process very seriously ... Contact is the key for internal & external customer both thats what i have learned from 11 yrs of my work exp"
"The application site has improved significantly. It's easier to navigate now and has direct-to-the-point items to fill out. I have not yet been invited for an interview for a professional application. But since I was OJ3 Intern back in 2011, seeing this process now surely makes applicants aspire more to be part of Johnson & Johnson. "
"The application process was very convenient to applicants, with smooth and quick processes. From a hopeful applicant's end, I'm considering the possibility of receiving feedback regarding the status of the application from the recruitment team as a way to improve the process. "
The application process was quite smooth and easy. It would be good to provide a quick personality test to allow users to find a good career fit prior to application. 
The application process was flawless. I have no complaints whatsoever!
The application process was fairly easy
"The application process should be trackable.
The rejection letter should mention the details, why the candidate is not shortlisted or selected. For example: academic non-eligible, Experience was not as per the role requirement, Less years of experience, skills are not upto the mark etc.
"
"The application process needs improvement, as we (in house applicants) are not getting communication from HR about the progress of resume even after vacancies are closed.
Request is to give the timely updates whether application is rejected or selected.

"
The application process is too long. I am an applicants that applied via Jobstreet and yet to receive any response from company. This is the first email that I have received from Johnson & Johnson.
"The application process could perhaps be improved if the recruitment website accommodated the inclusion of a cover letter, either as an attachment or text box."
"The application platform is very user-friendly with well structure, easy to use and clear guidance. 
One small suggestion I would like to give is: set up a facebook page for candidates to understand the progress of the application process. 

BTW, I think overall is a positive application experience, thanks a lot. "
The ANZ HR team needs major improvements in their recruitment process as I was extremely disappointed with how they handled my case from start to finish (if there was a finish as I just never heard back from them all of a sudden). I feel I was treated unfairly without good evidence so much so that the credible reputation of Johnson & Johnson has been marred forever in my opinion.
"The advice for recruitment process of Johnson&Johnson would be connected with large recruitment web-site such as mynavi, rikunavi or others as for it was hardly to find any recruitment information in those mainstream webs. Graduations could be get the newest recruitment information and collect what they want to know about Johnson&Johnson. In addition, going to campus for recruitment seminar is also a rapid way to gather talents for the company, and also the gallery for graduations to make full understanding of Johnson&Johnson."
The advertised position is a maternity cover contract. This was not mentioned in the advertisement.
"The advert application description and process was easily understandable and fast to process through, though it would have been prudent to have some sort of behavioral survey set so that it helps both the applicant get a feel of the job role and assists the employer also rate the applicant based off of Intelligence and emotional quotient aspects.
Having a diversity of applicants with different motivations for a job role assists the employers get a feel and sample more factors in selecting always changing attributes that match an ideal employee  "
"The addition of other relevant employee inputs on their experiences and perceptions of Johnson & Johnson's role describing a brief stance of their initial expectations and what has come to be their experience could be an additional decipher for potential candidates, if the particular positio best suits them. "
The access to taleo website can be more visible. It takes me a while to find the URL in order to update my profile. Overall experience was easy. 
"The 360 assessment is a good exercise to get to know what do people around the applicant think about her. However, it might be worth to consider to reduce the number of referrals required (6 names) as at the end there are only 3 references taken."
Thats good only it takes more time
That every one know about the openings in company.
"Thanks for the message. Pls consider points as below: 

1. Pls consider to reduce reference check quantity (in my case up to 6-8 people) because this can harm the confidentiality of the candidate joining JNJ recruitment process. 

2. the personal filling is quite repetitive leading to time-consuming matter because candidate needs to fill 02 times for same information (01 by email, 01 by hard copy)

3. Timing allowed for medical checkup after 03 days are quite tight because the candidate may have biz trip and cannot come back on time to do the medical checkup after only 3 days

4. The request of submitting the candidate's current labour contract may violate confidential term of that company which mat lead to possible legal risks.

Thanks"
Thanks for the effort. 
"Thanks for sending this survey over.  However, I haven't received any of response for my application whether its success or not.  It's appreciated if JNJ could give the initial feedback for their job applicant as my application for this role was almost more than 1 month ago.  Cheers "
"Thanks for giving me this opportunity.
As per my view Johnson & Johnson can improve to share feed back of candidates after getting interviewed if they are not selected. Some times I observed that even after a good interview rounds at Mumbai (Mulund) I didn't received any update about my candidature even after continuous follow-up (I understand there might be a company strategy and norms behind this). But as a candidate I hope that I should know if I was rejected because of technical aspects or something else.
But this is really good that even after rejecting in my last interview round with Johnson & Johnson  in December 2014, I am getting an opportunity to apply again with new hopes.
Thanks for giving me this opportunity
Best Regards
Sachin Shelke   "
"Thanks for being invited to participate in this survey!
And as a candidate, to be honest, I thought Johnson&Johnson could be a great example of being a reputable employer in the world because of quite quick response of feedback. While it's a system auto response but already having a positively incentive energy in some extent. 
If possible, getting a formal official response for recruitment process is better.

Hope it's a helpful suggestion.

Best Regards.
Ivy"
"Thank you very much for this opportunity to give suggestions about Recruitment process: 
1)It  should be more personalized. 
2)Candidate should get to know Approx comparison of him/her with company expectations & other candidate. 
3)One basic CV of candidate can be taken in database of company for different vacancies.
"
"Thank you for your recruitment. I am very happy to join J&J !!
If J&J had specified the schedule for when they release offer letter, the recruitment process would have been better.

"
Thank you for connecting with me.It gives me immense pleasure to be a part of your brand. The one thing I want could make recruitment process better is that having a small survey at the time of applying for having more information about a person who is applying for desire position.
Test case studies on the types of jobs applied in the experience of prospective workers to know the potential of job applicants well.
"Telephonic interviews could be held up.
After receipt of resume for candidate could be contacted to know further about their interest and eligibility for desired position."
Telephonic interview with the employer. 
Telephonic interview can be organized.
Telephonic as well as face to face interaction will enhance the fulfillment of requirement matching in-between employee and employer 
Telephonic /skype interview for out station candidates
TAT need to be reduced .. It takes days to hear from you after applying
"Talk to candidates about more than just their credentials and qualifications, keeping in mind that they may not be a fit for this role, but may be perfect for your next req.
Stay in contact with candidates to eliminate some of the fears and consternation that candidates often have during the hiring process."
"Talent recruitment process if invest in having skilled recruitment Specialists have a leg up for finding talent and qualifying them based on the job requirements, but furthermore for Culture Fit.

If you have recruiters who are career professionals, their insight to the marketplace and to candidates is vital for companies. When you don’t have candidate flow, your investment in talent acquisition is low. The second part to this statement, is that companies need to spend time to find the right search. Skilled search are expensive, but they are good for the company, good for building your brand, and great for concentration on bringing the right talent to your organization."
Taking survey elaborates the standard of the recruitment process and I feel this is satisfactory.
"taking off campus at various colleges, institute
motivating youth by providing them training as an apprentice"
Take shorter time to process the application.
Take online exam.
"Take my Interview, to know skills that I am equipped with"
Take me
"Take into account various factors when interviewing, including candidates cultural fit, their ability to work in team and motivation for applying. Also, J & J can give preference to local candidates for better know how about location and better inclusion."
"Take help of your staff. Ask for the reference of candidates 
Motivate internal staff for applying the position. "
"Take feedback or interview through Skype
Questions also from social issue"
Take face to face interview and main interview concern was show the talent and bahavior skill.
"Take an online interview with the person to know how he is capable, problem solving etc.Set candidate expectations with job success factors.The company should test the candidate regarding his skills,education etc. "
"Take acIt would be nice that international applicants could be taken into account for further job positions
"
Systematic process follow ups.
System was very slow
"Survey applicants for input to improve your recruiting process
Don’t underestimate the power of pictures and video"
"Sure to review the resume. And schedule must be there.
Strongly on psychology test.
Review the background through the resume or CV."
Summarising all the opportunities with j n j
"Suitable candidate like me, need to be hired immediately."
"Suggestions to be made in the Job description:

1- Salary range to be provided.

2- Timelines (for example: joining date, interview date etc)

3- Percentage of travel (both national and international)"
Suggesting J&J to read all through out the CVs to see the applicant's working experience so as to consider them on the applied post. As some don't mind the ability and talent of the applicant and just only based their decision on what course and school did they graduated from. And hoping that J&J will be transparent on the results of qualifying exam and as well as the interview.   
"Suggest J&J to take considerations who has applied multiple roles in the organisation as this can mean the candidate is keen to be part of J&J family.
To also consider interviewing candidates who may not have all the required requirements for the role, however, look at the candidate's attitude and interest in becoming part of the J&J family. "
Such type of feed back you have taken while applicants only filled the forms. that means this is very good practice and continue the same for future.
Strongly satisfied with the process
"Still waiting resume review answer. Will vert appreciate if you can let me know the schedule and prospect more precisely. Thanks.
Lu 080-6567-3230"
Still many suitable professional are not aware about the opportunities with J & J since the  vacancy information not widely informed through social media and all. 
"Still have not received any feedback if application was successful or not.
No timeframe has been given.
Thanks

"Sorry but I can't comment on the recruitment process of J&J as being a fresher I'm unable to analyse . It will be my first working experience if I get the job and I'll be very obliged. 
Thanku "
"Sorry ,currently I have no Specific Ideas about this ."
sometimes you need to look performance from candidates directly because CV or resume just show you small part of other potentials.
Sometime the site is getting hang. So a faster processor may be helpful.
Some updates on the progress of the application e.g. To let us know if we are still under consideration for the role or otherwise 
Some transparency in terms of application status.
some times good candidates are in market but its tough for them to reach big brands due to companies internal recruitment process. company should also think of hiring people out of reference also so that it woud be mix of both
"Some kind of follow up, positive or negative, would be nice"
"So far, the website and this survey is a new thing to me and it is good. But I need to complete the whole process to give a fair justification."
"So far, Johnson & Johnson already has the best system to recruit training. But maybe a bit more advertising to tell people."
"So far, i think that the recruitment process that Johnson & Johnson has at the moment is good, maybe the company may also want to reach out to individuals through LinkedIn or Jobstreet. but nonetheless, the current process is good. "
So far so good. Nothing to add at the moment.
So far so good. 
So far so good.
So far so good!
so far so good
so far recruitment process johnson&johnson very good for that in the future it will get better. succesfully !!
"So far nothing to be change, just give more change towards graduate and lack experience candidate."
"So far it went well. Though I didn't receive any interview calls. Hope it will go well.

"
"so far it is good, not to change much in recruitment process"
"So far it has  been good enough in terms of acknowledging the application and keeping the prospect engaged with this survey.
It would only be fair to comment once we go through the entire cycle."
so far I think is pretty good. What if you gave a case study for recruitment process
"So far i have not got any opportunity for an interview with J & J , so i cant comment about this "
So far i have no received any feedback or updates on the progress yet so it would be hard to comment on what J&J should do to improve further.
So far has been very good
So far all is good in the recruitment process. 
"So facts and figures provided are true and please try to be responsive cause I have served notice period and I am searching a job right now, so finally call or revert responses cause I am looking to join your family."
"Skill and knowledges was important but beyond those things the most important is can do attitude and integrity, company should provide training to improve Skill and knowledge and develope people with coaching and mentoring.

Sir I applied many times but didn't get any response and I want to work in J&J so what should I do ..? Please give me chance for interview. 
sir according to me i have apllied in many mnc pharmaceutical but nonoe replied it back but when i applied in your company it would replied back which is the main think to arose some spark in the applicant to get the opportunity to work with such agreat company and i thinks your requrietment process is good but i have one urge please give opportunity to fresher to work in your company
"Sir about recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson , I have no idea ,so unable to given suggestions.
When I will be selected then I can give you any comment.
Thanks"
"Since this recruitment process style is my first experience, I think this is interesting. However, the first time I received an email from you, I was a little bit concern about whether it is a phishing or something like that... So,  I wish if I could have a chance to hear from my agent in advance that the email would be sent directly from you. Thank you for your consideration."
"Since this is the first time I am applying and the process isn't complete, I an unable to judge and suggest."
Since the process followed for recruitment is lengthy but it is a part of company S.O.P so it requires no change 
"Since I haven't been interviewed yet at Johnson & Johnson, I wouldn't be in a position to comment on the entire recruitment process. "
"Since I feel I had the experience and the skills for the role, it would have been great to get to an interview. I am often left wondering if the JD is really a true reflection of what conpanies are seeking or not. Anyway, it's great that you at leasthad the courtesy to ask for this survey."
Since I am unfamiliar with the recruitment process I cannot provide any valuable suggestions to improve it. But whatever procedures I have gone through to apply for a specific post is simple and less time consuming.
Since I am currently at the very early stage of the process there is not much to improve. If I have more insights later I will share them with You.
Since database of applicants have been store in system. if there are other position available in the company whereby the applicant is more suitable then system should automatically identify the applicant by the key words from applicants details to be the candidate for that position even though the applicant did not apply for this position. 
Simplifying application process will resolve.
Simplify.
Simplify the resume submission process
Simplify the process.
Simplify the process
"Simplify roles requirement in simple words and avoiding technically heavy words...
Skills sets are those weapons that the same can be used accordingly in different industry except few general knowledge of the product, which can be overcomed by the skill of learning too in a very short span. And Thats what we call adaptability and dynamism that is required today and without which a candidate is just a another candidate.
And lack of knowledge of a new industry, should not be seen as an incapability to fit the role. Its skill and aptitude that matters the most.
At some point of Professional life, we all were amateurs
I worked in construction and oil & Gas for more than 20 years but still excelled in Automotive as to for the car manufacturer (Daimler Chrysler) to recognise my skill.

selection criteria is admirable
Selection by expert

Response to selected and non selected candidate on time
Response to Candidates should be very fast.

Respond sooner
Respond quicker. Clearly you are a huge organisation receiving thousands of applications for hundreds of roles however applicants appreciate an idea of expected timeframe. It was 3.5 weeks from applying to being advised of a phone interview. The phone interview took place soon after which was good but I was told that they would be making a decision on second round interviews early the following week. Another 3.5 weeks has passed and nothing further. I had reason to contact the Talent Acquisition Team about another role last week so inquired about the status of this role and was told they were still conducting first round interviews. Better communication in this area would be helpful. 
Respond promptly post application stage on the status of progress.
"Respected Sir,
As I have not gone through the recruitment procedure of Johnson & Johnson fully so it is difficult to put my comments on it but the application process is quite impressive and I think an extremely reputed company like Johnson & Johnson already has good recruitment process."
"Respected  Sir / Ma`am

I have an ability to grow with a job, handle responsibility and build positive relationships with work colleagues at all levels. My present employer is very satisfied with my work rate, and I am confident that I can bring the same level of high performance to your company.

Regular updating of Jobs.
Regular updates with updated technology.
"Regular updates on the applicant's status would be appreciated - whether the applicant is still being considered or has been rejected. Most especially now that it has been a month since J&J has contacted me. 

But overall, J&J has been very quick in contacting me after the application submission, and I am very impressed with their application process. "
Regular contact with the prospective applicants even if not much has changed in the process so that you feel engaged in the process. The same contact also after being successful in the process.
"Regardless of resume review result, I have not received any feedback yet from Johnson & Johnson. Hopefully hear any feedback soon. Thanks."

Recuitment Process was great !
Recrutmen should be fast ...
"Recruitment was smooth and informed (from the career fair booth and until the email and online applications), however the booth in school sadly ran out of flyers/brochures. The online process, however, was clear enough. Hopefully, we hear from the Johnson & Johnson soon."
"Recruitment time should be concentrated in the 3,4 months each year, because it is the peak supply
"
Recruitment time can be accelerated for candidate screening
Recruitment survey could have been asked to complete post interview to provide apt comments. Thank you.
recruitment should advise the status of  application.
Recruitment process would be much faster than current scenario.
"Recruitment process was obviously good and in trend of the present technology. But sometimes you need to talk with the applicants personally in able for you to range, see actuation and feel the sincerity in them, which could not been observed in an internet application process. Because you only interview  applicant who pass the criteria in an internet application, maybe  some of failed applicant could be the most suited for the job. 
Thank you for this opportunity."
Recruitment process was good. Yet we need a faster process for our application
Recruitment process was good. A timeline of the interview result given at the end of the interview or keeping us updated on the progress and when the position will be closed will give us some better idea i think.
"recruitment process to be transparent and online update the status.
"
Recruitment process should not be too slow to proceed further formalities after applying or after submitting the resume for any opening.
"Recruitment process should give the basic detail of all the stages of recruitment  which followed by J& J with feedback time line for applicant.

Recruitment process should complete in 15 days.

"Recruitment process is a bit unseal for me personally. The first interview over the phone was very good and productive but the second one by video conference was not really the best way to conduct interview in my openion. Especially when you have to do it 6:00 AM, early morning. I don't know how the interviewer make the best judgement out of our conversation when she's already late almost 20 minutes for the conference. If it was me who's late for the interview, I am very sure that will automatically impact my chance of prograssing to the next stage and I think it would have been different story if it was face to face interview. The interviewer also mentioned that she would get back to me at the end of last week with the outcome and she didn't, so I am assuming that I didn't make it to the next stage and that's a bit unfair but it's all good. Finding someone who's more suitable and match the job description is what matters to the company and I perfectly understand that. Having say that the recruitment process would have been a lot more efficient and productive it you give the candidate the chance to meet with the interviewer face to face. I believe having that chance would bring the best out of the candidiate as you can easily make a judgement out of the person who's right in front of you. Overall, It's worth trying and hopefully someday I get to have another chance to join the leading medical device company in the world! "
Recruitment process in Johnson & Johnson is good. Updating more often the applicants is helpful.
Recruitment process can Johnson & Johnson do to improve through experience  Knowledge and responsibility. 
Recruitment process can be improved by written tests assessment pertaining to the IQ and reasoning analysis. Skills can be trained after recruiting the employee but the intelligence can be judged by a written test..online /offline.

1. After submission of resume reply as soon as possible

Above described point play a very important role for any recruitment process as per my opinion."

"Rather than sending me a survey, you might actually respond to my application!"
"Rather than giving more importance to the qualification and experience of candidate, a technical analysis on the ability to perform the work should be given as an opinion from my side. The candidate should get a platform where he can prove his technical abilities as well his skills. May be a person with less experience can be more skillful than a much experienced candidate.

Its been my experience that once I applied for a position, I do not get any response (whether positive or negative). That would be very much appreciated."
Please convey if applicant is not shortlisted
Please contact the candidate 👌
"Please consider with real employee... 
I would like to have second chance to join with you!
Thanks."
"Please consider to add ""chat"" facility for knowing further insight into desired credentials. Overall the system is quite okay.  Thanks."
"Please consider each of applicants more detail. Please do not only see their educational background, but also skill and experiences. Some people may have other strength or opportunities that is not related with his/her educational background. Some people also eager to learn new things. Thanking you in advance."
Please confirm with in week whenever person applying for a job on direct portal.
Please concern about the interested persons
Please call people and understand their skills & experience
Please build in mechanism to keep candidates informed about status of their application. Also a provision of feedback. 
Please avoid time wasting in the recruitment process.
Please also look into the subjects the candidate has learnt in his/her MBA. I did my major in Digital communication management and minor in brand management but in my current job I was handed a role which is completely different from what I read. But I want to have a career in digital and that is the main reason I want to switch. If a company just looks into the fact that the candidate has digital experience or not then candidates like us will never get a chance to prove our worth. 
"Please add the draft function for application on website. Sometimes candidate is not able to finish all questions at once, it is a little frustrating that candidate need to do the questions all over again. But this is minor problem, the overall experience is good."
"Please add questionnaire for skill sets, that helps person to see if he can fit in that role or not."
Please acknowledge the job applicant. I did not receive any acknowledgement / communication after applying for the post of scientist toxicology/ senior scientist toxicology.

3. Salary range for perticular post"
"Phone call interview
"
"Personally, there is not much to say as I believe that J & J has an in- depth HR team that is diligent in vetting all applicants. I would have preferred a ""call back"" to notify that the application was received and is either under consideration or has been rejected. "
"Personally, I think the recruitment process is already excellent. But, as a fresh graduate, I think that it will be better if Johnson and Johnson give some information through Career Center of universities to help last year students or fresh graduates reach the information easier."
"Personally, i dont think there is any major improvement required."
"personally i think that skill, knowledge and education is most important than other things like caste, previous experience where is he or she educated where he or she is belong so if  you work on that matter other thing is negligible only you have to select those candidate who have skill and passionate about the work then it is beneficial also for the candidate and the co."
Personally call the applicants to prove there mettle in the interview. 
"Personalise the experience, mostly automated with general feedback.  Would be nice to know that someone actually looked at details provided.  I understand that you have many candidates to sift through which makes task impractical but some feedback would improve communication."
Personal contact
Periodic intimation of the process steps and status of application on mails 
"Perhaps, the company can send timely updates or send a timeline regarding the status of an application to candidates applying for a certain position, which allows transparency in the recruitment process."
"Perhaps to keep the candidates updated on the progress, even if they are not shortlisted"
"Perhaps tn the essence of saving time on interviews, a psychometric exam can be utilised initially this will assist in limiting the pool and possibly prevent a dilemma of a great candidate with a non strong test"
Perhaps the company can determine the selection criteria and attributes required for the position and create a profile of the ideal candidate if possible. 
"Perhaps the biggest issue was the timeliness in receiving an offer, approximately 4 months."
perhaps shorter response time. 
"Perhaps reply with a reason why. My CV matched the job description and the very next morning after applying I received a thanks but no..
 "
Perhaps provide the candiate with some indication of when they can receive some feedback if the have been successfull or not in moving to the next stage of the process.
"perhaps info if candidate is required to start work at short period, compensation package range."
Perhaps in the employee search for the operational part there is no need to use an outsourching company.
Perhaps frequent email updates of application progress and time estimate if/when J&J will notify successful applicants of interviews. 
Perhaps faster turnaround time in advising the candidates about their application status.
"Perhaps consider some questions to assess the candidate's character, as a cultural fit is also crucial for both parties."
Perhaps can post it on social media or more oppurtunity by direct mail offer if needed
Perhaps be more transparent on the progress of the process etc. 
Perhaps an easier way of monitoring application progress like an automated email every X days.
Perhaps a short word on why the application did not meet the requirements should the applicant be bypassed in the selection process and what might the candidate need to improve.
Perfect recruitment process as yours!
People should get a call based on their candidature and also people should get selected on the bases of capability and competencies instead on likeabilty.
Participate in event such as a job fair 
"Participate in different school job fairs. In this way you can scout potential applicants, getting the right of being the first to scout some potential candidate before they graduates."
"Overall, your recruitment process is quite perfect so that it is difficult to let qualified candidates slip through Johnson& Johnson. Personally, what is more important is that employees can offer the company and how to work faster and better."
"Overall, the recruitment process is absolutely good, but J&J can be more approachable than now as far as Chartered Accountant (finance Domain) is considered by participating in the Campus placements of CA."
"Overall, the process is already good. It just need to improve on timely response."
"Overall, the online recruitment process was well planned and thought through, such that it was simple for an applicant to navigate through the online portal. Expectations for the applicant was also clear and concise on the job description.

Nonetheless, a possible improvement could be an inclusion of a more detailed timeline for the graduate program."
"Overall, the application process was informative and straight-forward. However, to further improve the recruitment process, it would be helpful to provide a rough timeline of key dates such as when the results will be announced."
"Overall, I think process is good and effective. Third party recruiter (Blueline) and HR are quick to respond and keeps me updated. But I think J&J can still improve on the turnaround time of the end-to-end recruitment process."
"Overall, based on my experience Johnson and Johnson is one of the companies that have the best recruitment system. Johnson and Johnson only need to make a final confirmation to the applicant when the application wasn't qualified. "
Overall the process was easy. A small suggestion could be to ensure it is suited for low-bandwidth connections as well. 
"Overall it's good. And I'm happy to receive updates on new position and also informing success or not  success on application.

Thank you."
Overall i'm impressed with J&J recruitment process.  It is very easy and not complicated.
Overall Happy. But Johnson & Johnson can improve the speed of recruitment process.
Overall Good procedure..
Overall Good Experience with the recruitment process. 
Overall Good
"Outline of recruitment process timings and clear indication if time line has changed. 

This will allow candidates to assume that they have not been considered furthered if they have had no response by a certain time.
"
"Other then experience please see canditate potential too .. potential like business skills, convencing ability, etc.."
Other than an automated response I have not heard anything as to the progress of my application so it is difficult to address the question of improvement.
organize talks and fairs to introduce any job opportunities 
"Organize local hiring opportunities in cities or municipalities, like a job fair, and conduct on site interview."
"Opportunity must be given to most of the applicantsto go through the selection process , irrespective of their results."
"Operations Managerial.
Project Management.
Maintenance & Engineering Manage.
"
"Openings for local human resources at each branch of the company, to understand the willingness of the market at the local site for the betterment of the company.
by making an announcement not only through its own website, but also through several online and offline media related."
"Openings are not visible on Social media sites like LinkedIn, Naukri.com. People come to know about openings only through alumni."
Opening already posted on various social sites. No additional procedure is required.
Open to every necessary things that is to be learnt for the enhancement of the growth of the organization. 
"Open more roles for entry levels, and fresh college graduates."
Open more opportunity for international. I worked for Unilever 3 years with  top-60 MBA degree. But I got rejected because I dont have work permit. 
Open communication.
"Only the timing issue. I hope J&J can send feedback or proceed the next steps to potential candidate quicker.
Thanks. "
Only the response time to the candidate to be improved. Either suitable for a position or not a minimum lead time to be set where the candidate came to know whether his profile considered or not.
"Online test (eg: IQ, EQ, English,...)"
Online interview would be good
"Online application process needs a final review process before the submission - I was going through the steps to check if I needed anything else than the resume and the cover letter, and took me as a surprise when I received the message that the application was submitted after the gender equality question. Typically other online applications have a final review process where it lets candidate review and submit or save the application for later step.
The video interview system needs a technical improvement - not very friendly with the Mac OS and perhaps not very consistent. My interviewer was unable to connect to the system - and we ended up talking over the phone, which was fine, but it was obvious both of us had technical difficulties."
Online
One to one interview
One To One Approach will be more considerable 
one suggestion from my side is to change phone interview to video conference interview to have a better interaction between interviewers and interviewee
One should get a clear status  from the recruiter regarding the process of the recruitment 
"One of best company of the planet. I have more than 5 year Entrepreneurial Journey Experience , This is only organization which I loved the most and wanted to work with this organization.

One can also go for offline campus recruitment in different collages or institutes across the countries which are also working good in different research areas of science.
"One appreciates the sheer mind blowing number of applications Johnson & Johnson HR/ Recruitement must be handling. But, it would be nice if there could be a time bound process visible to candidates. That is the number of days within which a candidate should hear the status of her/ his application's success (or not). And subsequent time bound process for the chosen CVs. Thanks so much for approaching me with the survey, it exhibits the value you put on prospective candidates. "
"Once the application are send/mailed some confirmation and revert should happen. 
I have applied multiple times to diferent roles but till date I have not got any confirmation of my resume matches or there is not update.

I am sure it will be helpful for the applicant to understand the details as is the profile okay or not and will he be given an opportunity to interact with the team. "
Once candidates apply for any possition there should be call.back from hr team to acknowledge reciept.
Once candidate applied regardless of his selection inform him about the improvement area & consider whenever next opportunity comes
"Once apply for the position there should be a clear reply whether the application is acceptable or rejected. 
Working with J&J is a unique opportunity for everyone.. keep up the good work.
"
"On my personal experience, the job offer is taking too long. Two whole weeks and still no offer. It's sort of getting frustrating but I am hopeful."
"On my opinion, coparing your on-line process with Korean Recruit Process like ""SARAMIN"" or company own web site, your process has many chapters. 
I think your ""attached resume"" site is duplicated. Web site asks my private informations like country,gender,birth date & current address. But, English Resume has all answers for your requests. Maybe it makes applicant mistkes of  reading or completing. "
On line attachment needs to little simpler.
"On contacting for query resolution owing to a tech glitch, the response was not received via mail and I had to contact someone telephonically.

Ensuring prompt response via mail is useful.
"
OK
OK
Office tour to be understand how the company operates

"Not Sure. Your Application process is good. However, if you feel the candiadate is suitable for another opportunity in your organisation , then should call him directly for the interview.

Please update on the candidature to the candidate (including me).

Best Regards,
Ketan"
"Not sure if its possible considering the number of applications you receive but it might be a good idea to provide a tracker for applications. 

Something which depicts the journey. So even if the HR teams don't find the candidate suitable they at-least know they weren't the right fit.  

Might need a change in the HR side of the application management system and a few extra clicks per person from the HR team. "
"Not sure if it is too much to ask, however if this can come as pop-up survey during application process (like after submission) then the respondents will be able to give better response as experience with the process will still be fresh in their mind.   "
not so.
Not required any change.
Not received call from your HR. So not clear about the status of a job application. Please make process more clear.
"Not quite sure whether the process of selection is my profile will processed by JNJ global then select the potential for market or market can select by themselves?

Some candidate may well known in that area in the market, if selection done by global team company may lose the opportunity to meet the valuable candidate."
Not only by website but also from career or jobfair.
Not only access the competences and skills ( what is crucial) but also expand horizons by giving the opportunity to bring new ones from overseas ( not to stick to requirement to have xxx years of AU experience).
Not much. Completing this survey is a first in all my years of applying for a job.  Why do you think this helpful in your screening process?
"Not much, to be honest; even the response time was better than I expected. "
Not much comment on this since I have not go through an Johnson & Johnson interview before. Hope I get the chance to experience in the future. Thanks!

"No matter the number of job applications J&J should automatically send emails to all applicants once the job has been successfully filled or removed from the market. 

Companies are doing a great disservice to potential employees by not having a programmed response email delivered. This could also include bi-weekly updates notifying all if the position approval is still pending. 
You can send me a survey with little hesitation, try being a bit more human with your hiring protocol and round out the application process. 
Thank You

"Nama saya Hanafi. Saya lulusan dari Institut Teknologi Medan. Teknik Informatika Komputer. Dan sampai saat ini saya masih bekerja sebagai penyuluh lapangan di peternakan ayam Boiler.

Adapun tanggung jawab saya adalah membuat laporan tentang kematian dan pakan yang terpakai per hari. Menjelaskan kepada peternak tentang cara penggunaan obat. Menjelaskan kepada peternak yang baru pertama sekali beternak tentang manajemen pemeliharaan pada saat brooding serta apa saja yang harus disiapakn. Dan lain-lain.

Saya memilih pososi Profersional Sales diperusahaan johnson & johnson karena ketertarikan saya di bidang marketing.  Disamping itu saya juga ingin mengembangkan kesempatan bergabung dengan TIM profersional yang ada di johnson & johnson.

Adapun hal yang paling tersulit bagi saya menghadapi peternak adalah ketika peternak tesebut suka melakukan kecurang semisal menjual pakan atau ayam.  Bila hal ini terjadi biasanya saya langsung mengambil tindakan yang sangat tegas yaitu pemecatan kepada peternak kecuali jika peternak tersebut mau mengakui perbuatannya dan meminta maaf maka saya akan memberikan kesempatan dengan beberapa catatan tertentu.

My suggestion is only that you should give a chance to the applicant once in interview who applied for the job. He may be not suitable according to rules but let him prove his candidature for the job.
"My suggestion for the improvements:
- established more network for the job posting so more employees will know and recognize it. 
- on recruiting, make sure that employee have a good well known about the clients company. 
"
"My resume is headhunter recommendation, if from receive a call from a headhunter to receive this research, it's a long time,  at least two to three weeks. So if you can consider by defining the company job requirements and details,maybe you can receive your resume more in line with company's position to save selected time"
"My proven success in achieving marketing objectives, along with my comprehensive expertise in utilizing online channel to dramatically improve sales, as well as success in launching of online shopping mall, will contribute immensely to the success of Johnson & Johnson "
My personal idead that two weeks for Johnson & Johnson to review the candidate's application is probably a long period of time. I hope that the recruitment process could be improved and the processing time will be shorter in the future so that the candidate could save some of the waiting time.
"My opinion, I think this process is good."
My experience thus far with the recruitment process has been quite good. Thus I have no suggestion at this time. 
"My experience so far has been limited to submitting an application, so it's hard to give any feedback.  Everything I have seen has been positive. "
"My experience has been a positive one in the main, with Johnson & Johnson international website presenting a sophisticated portal to apply for a role.

I see the opportunity to work for Johnson & Johnson as a significant step forward in my career, and I believe I can utilize my skills in marketing and sales to the benefit of Johnson & Johnson.

I look forward to experiencing the next step in the process, by being invited to attend an interview to fully explain how I can be a valuable asset to the company in Vietnam.

My belief is Johnson and Johnson implementing the best process to hire the talent.
My application was rejected
My application process took 3 months to complete. There were a lot of useful exercises throughout the process however wait times were quite long in some instances. Perhaps this could be improved in the future. 
Must try to get back to the applicant as soon as possible and clarify the status of application
Must start the selection process immediately and deliver the selection results by  end of the day
Must review the submitted CV and immediately invite qualified individuals for interview to assess the applicant
Must Initiate SMS intimation to give an update on the process.
Must inform candidates about application status
Must be user friendly and specific. Under the country categories there should be specific areas/places of candidates preference. Also as a registered job seeker I would really appreciate that new offers be sent in a form of an alert or email. 
Must be quick response
Must be fastest in process recruitment for fulfill the vacant position.  For else is good.
"Mostly candidate who applied are employee for his current company, and want to keep responsibility to managing or monitor. On this Johnson & Johnson to take initiative to hold process after office hours in case request face to face interview, hold the interview process at saturday or sunday, or through skype."
Most of us did not get to know about vacancy. Kindly provide tha vacancy detail in website 
"Most of the time J&J hiring managers favours internal candidates over external candidates at positions higher than sr Manager e.g Associate Director, General quality Manager,Quality Director etc ( many times applied for India and Singapor job postings but later became aware that internal candidate was preferred) .Thus it looks like job posting on external websites like linkdlen is done only to comply HR requirement.Thus deserving candidate do not get opportunities to add showcase their talent and add value to your organization."
"Most of the people love to work in Johnson & johnson. As that i am also the one.
I dont have any suggestion on improvement on recruitment."
"Most of the companies hires from same industry experience, I think sales people from other industry experience can bring new ideas and scope."

More regular/consistent feedback
More quickly to inform the status of recruitment
"More prompt updates on the recruitment status, applied for the position since 6 April 2017 but no application status updates till date. 
Applicants tend to be fluid hence is important to keep them warm during the application process - recruiters could call the candidates for a short interview instead of waiting for the job posting to be closed before starting the recruitment cycle. To have a good closure on applications - if the candidates do not meet the job requirements, a courtesy rejection mail should be sent to put a closure to their application. "
More promotion on the campus.
More personal touch. Faster response for both shortlisted and rejected applicants.
"More open procedure, more open information"
More open for real opportunity on the company in the world 
More on placing in reputable job seeker application also open hiring in several reputable university
More of the easy approach towards the candidates and candidates can  know more about the vacancies

More information in your website about activities in support employee skills 
More information about the schedule of the whole recruitment process.
More information about application status.
More human resources to fastrack the screening and see the best applicant
"More frexible way to recruit people from an internal company.Because what I saw from my experience most Job offer on this talent aquition site seems like fixed job offer. An applicant is already decided when we apply for the recruitment. So it's neither a fair recruitment approach nor public offering. This is what I faced when I try to contact these job offer on the site.
I think it's better to separate public offering job from fixed offering job."
More flexible negotiation of benefit
"More feedback on the current process, be it positive or negative. "
More feedback on the application status of applicant.
More fast for the recruitment process
More fast and quick recruitment process.
"More explanations about decision

More concrete description on job requirements and work duties would be beneficial for a better job matching. 
More communication post application 
More clearly step by step in process and quick respon for status application that already submitted.
"More clarity on the timeframes until a response - favourable or unfavourable. I applied for the role about two weeks ago, however I have had no follow up beyond the initial automated response. I'd love to know whether my application for this role will result in an interview, or whether I should turn my attention elsewhere."
More chance to the candidate like direct contact to candidate.
More career opportunities for the recent graduates
More better in application process and verification to the email.
More announce in online media
more and better communication to the candidate
More abundant filters to find the relevant posts
More  opportunity for Regional IT role.
Mobile interview will be an added advantage
"Minor changes could be advantageous, like LinkedIn easy apply, faster turnaround time after application. "
Minimize time taken for recruitment.
"Might some of your cooperative agencies were not listed in your application website. 
 Brecruit Limited referred me to Johnson & Johnson Medical Suzhou Ltd. But I don't remember I can find Brecruit in the listed agencies."
"Might be helpful to share with applicants an estimated time period for which applications will be considered so as to help better manage expectations / planning. Overall, the application process was straightforward and quick to complete. "
"menurut saya dengan interview dapat mengoptimalkan rekruitmen, setiap calon pegawai pasti ada kekurangan dan kelebihan yang perlu di kaji lebih dalam."
"Membuat group untuk calon"" pelamar berdiskusi , seperti yang di lakukan oleh perusahaan perusahaan lain "
Meet personally for better selection process rather than online system.
"Measuring the applicant ability about the skills and knowledge is easier rather than measuring the character. It can be calculated by several tests objectively.

Observing people who have long experience on organization, I found a special character and spirit when they have the opportunity to work in the company. I feel that it is very significant for J&J Company to have such employees. I think J&J Company needs to ask very detail about the most significant activity from organization experience to applicant. By that, the company can measure how far and how strong the applicant to achieve their target (expected result)."
maybe you can do more propaganda to let more people know the recruitment
"Maybe us as an applicant, I hope that we can get notified with any update on our applications. I hope that we improve that part as we applicants would love to have those updates."
Maybe timely feedbacks and update will help.  =)
Maybe the turnaround time in informing the applicant. 
Maybe provide more version of language for candidate from overseas or multi-culture background.
Maybe provide more active feedbacks for the outcome of personal application
Maybe provide a more personalized message of the outcome of the recruitment process. If someone is not successful what would be the key thing for that outcome.
"Maybe please give a chance to those lacking job experience. Especially if they have the educational background. There's an in-house company training that will be provided, if they can pass the training and they have the education and qualities i believe they can also do the job just like those experienced employees. Besides everything can be learned and everyone can be trained if they want to. How can one have an experience if almost all companies are looking for an experienced one? "
"Maybe more detailed insight on the exact duties of the designation can be provided.
I am facing some technical error (loading error) while filling a part of the application for another role in J&J.
Kindly look into these errors."
Maybe Johnson&Johnson could do a video interview or interactive test
"Maybe Johnson & Johnson could improve its recruitment process by cutting down its processing time. Also, simplified application process with no creation of profile, but if it is important part to obtain applicant  information then its okay. In that way, maybe, more applicants could apply and become interested to pass their resume'. Thank you!"
maybe J&J can inform the candidate the recruitment status and schedule of next event in real time.
Maybe inform the applicant the progress of the application. 
"Maybe increase the application status update to applicants, as for some position you may need to wait several months to hear back, or at least provide a general timeline for the applicant that may help easier the application process."

Just continue this recruitment process since it is very helpful and informative to all applicants. 
Just connect with the candidate and you should give proper communication that candidate salacted or not and explain about next process.
Just be more specific on the job description.
"Just ask to submit the resume. Almost all the candidates give maximum of the information through resume. Once you feel candidate is good than proceed with further query which is a must for the company to know. AI can shortlist the form for sure its helpful if company is getting too many of applications. But minimum requirements which is needed to AI will be time saver. Judging a candidate with the interest in Company through the detail filling of form can be good but may be not so attractive. One good example can be NETFLIX.  Sorry if I am writing too much.

I would really appreciate and am looking forward to hear from you soon. I think my credentials will be a good fit in your company. Although the scale of your employees and number of applicants will make it difficult to reply to each applicant separately, I feel it would be really great if you could give the feedback to their applications individually. Apart from that I feel the recruitment process is good."
"Johnson and Johnson can really set candidate expectations with job success factors. Make information about job success factors available to all candidates at the point of application by simply linking to it within the body of the job description.

Johnson & Johnson should do online assessment for the first stage of recruitment
"Johnson & Johnson should become more active on LinkedIn by adding the LinkedIn Easy Apply button for example. The current model (via Taleo) takes a long time, and might scare away good potential candidates that do not want to go through the whole process of logging in (lost password/lost username/slow website)."
Johnson & Johnson should be give information to candidate if he past or not pass recruitment process

"Johnson & Johnson respond to candidate application is very fast and effective. Besides, application process was so simple and easy. 

In my opinion, survey should be in certain extend to identify not only the person's skill but also those with right attitude. But if you are looking for the perfect candidate or a very narrowly defined skill set, then you’re missing out on those who could become that perfect candidate with a little bit of growth and development. "
"Johnson & Johnson recruitment process is very good. It is user friendly and very easy to understand. By the way In keyword search box if changing the normal keyword search box to job name list, it will be easier for user to search the job "
Johnson & Johnson might want to apply the employee referral scheme so there will be a high chance for the prospective employees to staying longer. The company can also hire a recruitment agent to speed up the recruitment process as they can focus more on analysing the applicants' resume should the current in-house recruiter cannot devote so much time on the hiring procedure. 
"Johnson & Johnson may want to have a small team to look into 3 more stages of hiring managers and above. Currently, the application received (commonly in-placed) and survey of process (uniquely in-placed) are much appreciated. The other 3 stages to be considered are 
1) A HR  personnel to contact the applicant through email that review is completed and possibly interview session to be arranged (can be considered), 
2) hiring manager or HR personnel to notify the shortlisted outcome through LinkedIn or email
3) Interview arranged and outcome of the interview"

Johnson & Johnson is having a good recruitment process.The job description is well explained and so is the application process maintained properly.But it would be good if the candidate is also given suggestions on the basis of his/her profile review which positions could also be a better fit so that it becomes an interactive involvement.
Johnson & Johnson is doing their best as far as recruitment process is concerned.
"Johnson & Johnson is decades old & a very reputed company.

More than what I can suggest it already knows how to recruit the best & deserving candidates.

Still, best to my knowledge, a candidate who holds his work experience with various organisations would be much skillful rather than the one who spent a decade in a similar company.

A candidate who is looking for a good work culture, a company with values & a good reputation is surely a deserving candidate for he surely will not be into office politics.

Yes, there are people who hate office politics & believe in work, using their skills at job."
"Johnson & Johnson is always transparent, candid and neutral. They should maintain the standard. "

"
"Johnson & Johnson is a very transparent recruiter. I appreciate the prompt communication email messages that I receive from your end, which help me realise that my job application is truly being viewed by a person and not just going unnoticed in a vast pool of applicants to J&J.

What could be changed is that candidates whose profiles, rather the wordings in their resumes, are not an exact fit, must be considered for the roles as we might miss out on a good candidate just because their resume doesn't show exact match of relevant experience.

Thank you for taking the time to hear out my opinion. This is what I love about Johnson & Johnson!"
"Johnson & Johnson is a very reputed company. I think in the process of recruitment of an experienced or fresher candidate, the research and development group of the company must interview the person about his skills/expertise which is to be needed for the company and also how much he can dedicate himself/herself to improve or betterment of the company's future.

Secondly, like this page company should create a career blog where applicants can subscribe to the blog by posting status updates on various social media sites."
"Johnson & Johnson is a really good company. The recruitment system is easy to use for me. However, there were some problems happening when I press the previous button to come back to the previous page. It said that there were something wrong with the server, when I came back to the previous page to 
re-upload my resume and cover letter. After I tried several times, it could work finally. I don't know whether it's the wrong with the sever or my connection.
Thanks for having me to do this anonymous survey. Hope to hear from you soon."

"Johnson & Johnson have a good recruitment procedure, it is only to insure that the person/applicant hired have a consistency to the job or work pertained to him/her. Character is one of the main aspect that need to be considered in hiring. Experiences can be verify, but the character and attitude of a person signifies the output especially in a long term commitment with the company. Loyalty, being concern and the love of the job that make a person to work hard for the goodness and growth of the company or business. It must have a character to be the asset and not a liability to a company or business."
Johnson & Johnson has done perfectly. Is is more simpler than oher companies' recruitment processes. Perhaps it can be made less steps in the future.
"Johnson & Johnson has been provider of baby care products all over the world. The company is reputable, so I commend the recruitment process they are providing. "
"Johnson & Johnson has already established a great reputation name in the market, as a big company I think it's best to focus more on being responsive to applicants through internet/mails. And also the company should manage to conduct an exam to the lucky applicants chosen from the online application."
"Johnson & Johnson has a very good name in the world, and it is a brand...by seeing the candidate curriculum vitae on the site or emails, we can alot a HR manager to know about the candidate and arrange the interview either through Skype or direct base..

This would help lot of candidates applying for various positions in Johnson & Johnson...and this kind of doings will also let HR knows about the candidate when there is an conversation better than written conversation through mails...

This is only my point of thought and not to hurt anyone....

"Job process is too heptic. You should call the recruitment as u got their resume 
You take too much time to select the employee for your reputed company"
"Job openings should not be restrictive for candidates in regards with location.

Atleast an opportunity for an interview should be given to the candidate because a CV/Resume might not reflect the actual potential of the candidate whereas if given an opportunity for an interview through video call can reflect the potential and experience of the candidate.

Candidates from small companies could also bring new ideas and could add an additional value to the company so candidates with background from small MNC's should also be given same importance. 

Thank you for giving me this opportunity for sharing my views about the recruitment.

JnJ is known for a robust recruitment process. I would really like to see how welcoming it is to the candidates who believe and have same goals as the company.

"J&J is the one of best health care company,and one of the best brand.I want to be part be part of such a place,serve my employment within the organisation."
"J&J is one of the best company to work with.I think they have the best person on table and what they do will surely in favour of the organization.
Only thing what I want to say, at least call the candidate for the interview may be he/she has the potential which won't be seen in his/her CV."
"J&J is good organization and having very good repute all over the glob in my suggestion regarding Malaysia,you should consider foreigners as well if having relevant experience and permit so they also avail these kind of opportunities. "
J&J is already well reputed organisation in each process. For recruitment process am not the correct person to judge as i am applying for internship or entry level job.
"J&J is already following excellent  process, one thing you can add give opportunity to other sector employees."
J&J is a great company to work with. I don't see any reasons for improving the streamlined current recruitment process. Thanks.
"J&J HR can have a telephonic round of interview, before personal interview."
"J&J has very well defined recruitment process and robust HR department. I always feel proud to be associated with such a great & most reputed organisation. 
I just want to mention about one technical part. Many a times the internal applicants once rejected or not considered, do not get adequate info about the same. Any intimation to those candidates about current status of application & reasons for rejections can definitely help the candidate to improve upon. Whereas for referral candidates, periodical information do come to the referrer on a regular basis at every stage.
Lastly once again, my organisation provides the widest range of opportunities to its employees to perform & excel in different verticles as well as explore the best of her/his capabilities."
"J&J has an extensive career choices, hence you may provide a tool for applicants to explore what role or functional area fits their skills and experiences or maybe personality. "
"J&J has a good tool, and the communication is clear, I can not see this moment any improvement."
"J&J could improve the recruitment process by responding quickly or capping the response time at 10 days or so.

Since I have not heard back yet, I do not know where do I sit in the process at the moment."
J&J could improve on giving a distinct feedback to unsuccessful candidates so they can improve themselves next time they apply rather than making the same mistake 
J&j can showcase the vacancies on LinkedIn jobs since it is a widely used authentic platform for job search
J&J can provide time frame on how long candidate will wait for the response and/or when it will be considered not successful
J&J can mention clearer career progression. 
J&J can interact with the applicant and motivate them to make them aware about what J&J want from them
"J&J can improve the recruitment process if they can inform the applicant within 3 days period if they are shortlisted or not, in order for them to move and avoid waiting in the que. "
"J&J can implement an system to intimate the applicant whether he is selected or not, also whether they receive and view the applicant application form. "
J and J very good organisation.They select candidate on their valuable skill
"J and J should explore new talents as well.There should be at least one written test for all candidates based on different competencies to check behaviour of persons,based on that further interview rounds Should be done."
J and J can give more emphasis for the applicable positions in terms of highlighting the job criteria as 1) Non-priority / 2) Priority mode depicted in the posted roles.
"J &J recruitment process is good but application review timing is taking long time.
If it is take less time than will be fantastic job."
J & J to provide statistical information about number of online application received for each position and also more detail information on the status of the my online application
J & J need to set up more transparent recruitment process to the interviewers to let them know their weakness and strength.

"I`ve seen few of Johnson&Johnson vacancy in the web recently. They were all shown a very detail about the work and the requirements of the eligible applicants. However, I did not notice any specific requirement for the Therapeutic Area Lead (such educational background, working experience, specific skills) like other vacancy, or I might miss to read it somewhere in the web.It would help the applicants if  the information is quite precise about the working requirements. 

On contrary, I guess Johnson & Johnsosn Talent Acquisistion Program was quite professional by giving applicant the chance to evaluate the recruitment system. Hopefully, it remained proffesional until the company decide to decline or furtherly process the candidate application with proper notice. "
its very good but every  process have scope of improvement 
Its really good and I am happy with the recruitment process.
Its quite good but I believe vacancies should be published in local  newspaper and magazines too.
"Its pleasure to write about one of the best pharma organisations in the world.

I feel current recruitment process is good.

I make difference in work
thanks & regards-Kishore Gondrala
 
"
its okay its a grea tprecedure
"Its my opinion is ""final interview will conduct through video conference"", this is save the time."
"its improved, not a big deal"
"Its high end recruitment process, too good"
Its good..
"Its good. However after applying online, there must be attempts made to conversate with maximum of candidates in person or over phone to get a clear picture of their skillset and knowledge. Online application doesnot provide much of such window."
Its good that company is taking these type of cross check against thinking of candidate it should be more better if you guys put some company related questionnaire 
Its good process nothing change can be required now.
"Its good process Carried  out by J & J, but its very slow can be get on fast track.
"
its good process 
"Its good as of now, will be able to share it more accurate once joined"
its good
its enough
Its better way to recruit with face to face interview
Its been a week since my application and I still havent heard from the recruitment office. Thanks
"Its an easy process. So, I did not find any fault in the recruitment process."
"Its always a dream to be a part of such prestigious organization that is  Johnson & Johnson.I have confidence that i am enough skilled and talented to a part of this company  but never got an opportunity to prove my potential.
So i would request you to please give me a chance and others who deserve.By this way i can be an asset and thus your recruitment process will be awarded for best talent acquisition
Thanks
Fahad"
Its already very good...
its already good for me.
Its already good at JnJ. Telephonic discussion regarding role with HR can further help the candidate.
Its already a nice suevey to know about the employee mind. But it can make better by asking more questions about past industry criteria. And how johnson & johnson is more challenging for them.
Its a simple and self guiding process which is user friendly 
"It,s truly user friendly website. Perfect!"
It's working perfectly for me at the moment.
"It's very honored to receive your E-mail,and I used to want to join Johnson & Johnson.But it's a bit late to get your mail. I've found the company to wrk.I suggest that you should be able to give the news a bit faster in the future.

BASET WISHES FOT Johnson & Johnson!
Thank you !"
It's taking more time to recruit..  kindly do the selection process immediately as soon as possible.
It's scientific
It's really good experience for me during the application.
It's quite well managed.
It's ok as far as my concern.
it's ok
It's not my bussindess
It's no problem so far.
"It's just started with me so it's too early to say ,till now it's good"
It's great process already.
It's good:)
It's good recruitment process.
It's good for application. Please provide other positions for new oppatunity.
It's good enough~
It's good enough. 
It's fine. Very systematic. Thank you.
"It's excellent process as hardly few employers take feedback on the application process. 

Best Regards,

Varsha "
It's enough to improve the recruiting process. Thank you
It's better to give the applicants faster feedbacks
It's better to add  on a review button before submitting the application. Thank you.
It's already very good. 
"It's already very clear , transparent and strong enough "
It's already satisfactory 
It's already good.
It's already fabulous. Thanks.
It's almost perfect as far as talent finding & finalising the recruitment of a candidate. It would be great if candidates could be contacted via mail or SMS to give feedback on their application for a particular position they have applied for within a definite timeline. Rest all good. All the best. Regards.
"It's a very clear and Intuitive process, if you could also reply back to the application swiftly that would be much better. 
Thank you, for giving this opportunity. "
It's a right and new technique for requirement right now.
"It's a OK , But Sometimes we feel that is not proper way due to some questioner ."
"It's a great pleasure to do the survey. I have some friends also for j&j loved, but sometimes they may not know the recruitment news, hope to more recruitment information spread, is advantageous to the talent introduction. thank you."
"It's a good process, improvement always comes from learning and learning is life time process. Keep learning it will get automatically improve when it requires. I don't have any comments, first I need to improve and prepared myself to set the J&J level."
It's a good process which you are practising currently but try to reply all the applicants for there job application I know it's not possible but try for the same.
It's a good process to analyze the candidate's opinion and mental ability... 
It'll be better to send the survey immediately after the application submission instead of after 1-2 weeks of the submission 
"It'll be better if the system can show the apply status, then candidates can know whether their resume have been read.  "
It would have been nice to get  an e-mail to let me know that the application is under consideration from someone from talent acquisition team before getting this survey. 
It would be very helpful if the company website can provide more opportunities to connect with current employees or former interns at the company. Applicants would like to learn more through the insiders. 
It would be useful to access job description requirements. 
It would be nice to understand what the recruiting processes and time frames are.
It would be nice to provide the status of the open position if it is still open or had been filled up. 
"It would be nice to provide brief status feedback to candidates on each key stage of the recruitment process so as to keep the candidates updated where are they in the process, including if the candidates’ applications are not successful.

"
"It would be nice to hear back on the status
Of the application whether selected or rejected "
"It would be nice to be sent a rejection notice for our application. If at all possible, a short note of why we are not considered for a role, it would be most helpful. 
Thank you."
"It would be much better if the job name/title mentioned in the final feedback message to avoid any confusion especially in case the candidate made 2 or 3 applications in 2 or 3 different jobs in the same time so it is not clear if the final feedback message is linked to one of these applications or all. 

Please find the below message I received for the final feedback where you can find it's very vague

It would be more interesting if add creative animation on these survey..but i'm satisfied with the recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson
It would be interesting (from a worldwide company like J&J) for the candidates to know if the job opening is focused on Nationals only or open to foreign/expat applicants.
"It would be ideal to have an application progress tracking system (Application received &gt; Application under review by HR &gt; Application under review by hiring manager &gt; Interview 1 &gt; Interview 2 etc), so that applicants will be informed the stage that his/her application has reached.

This way, it will also be informative for J&J to gather data (for example at which stage most candidates fail, which stage takes the longest time, which is the bottleneck during recruitment process) and examine/improve the recruitment process. "
It would be highly apprecaited that we can know how long would it take for the resume check and its result.
"It would be helpful to update the applicant on the progress of his/her application to J&J. With this, applicants will be able to track the status of his/her application."
It would be helpful if informed to applicants ahead of time on whether the company will assist with obtaining work permit for those applicants applying from foreign countries. Or if the company would entertain candidates who are willing to work on their own work permit if they are to be shortlisted or chosen for a position.
It would be great to inform candidate even if we are not shortlisted & also at least provide a few key pointers of why we did not get shortlisted / chosen. 
"It would be great to indicate any age restriction in view of many job seekers who are either in their mid-forties or above, this would help to reduce unnecessary applications."
It would be great if you can provide the contact details of an employee currently handling a similar role. It helps the candidate to get a better understanding of the role by connecting with him or her. I got a good understanding of the role from one of my batchmates handling the same role.
It would be great if we could follow the steps of our application online
It would be great if there is respondent to the candidate's application outcome. Thank you!
"It would be great if the interface is more mobile friendly or simplified to allow for higher ease of application on the go. Alternatively, having a mobile/tablet app interface should make the experience better to."
It would be great if the company can return up with a mail regarding status of their application as against Recruitment .
It would be great if Johnson & Johnson could provide the applicants an update on their application status. 
It would be great if Johnson & Johnson allows the applicants to update the resume for jobs applied as applicants might acquire new skills between the time of submission and time of processing at Johnson & Johnson end. 
It would be great if I would be notified when the company decides not to proceed with my application. That would enable me to move on to other opportunities. 
It would be great if i was given a feedback on my applications. I have never received nor hear anything from anyone on any of my applications. Your applicants are practically consumers of your products thus should be treated as clients.
It would be great if I can open my submitted resume while applying a position from J&J  website because I can check again whether I had submitted  a correct one or not. I think the process so far so good. Thanks.
It would be great if an applicant can have chances to modify her/his resume after finished uploading.
"It would be good, if JnJ can keep the status updated more regularly"
It would be good to that JnJ could response to candidate if he/she is not being shortlisted for face-to-face interview within 14 days. This will allow the candidate to move on to next job searching. Thank you. 
It would be good to receive email alert from Johnson and Jonhson during the application progress. thank you. 
It would be good if you could give an estimated time that it might take to hear back regarding the application. 
"It would be good if the process can be done with personal data & uproad full CV.

Thanks  again."
It would be good if J&J is able to provide a rough timeline/ interview process in the acknowledgement email. 
"It would be better to let the candidates know as well if when would the ""results"" for the application process be so that they would also be less anxious in checking their emails everyday to check for an update. :) "
It would be better to give a notice to all of applicants including the candidate is not the right person to proceed an interview. Thank you. 
It would be better to be updated weekly or bi-weekly the status of my application.
It would be better to apply SEO (Search Engine Optimization) in Google in order to make it easier for people who look for any vacancy in J&J
It would be better if you also took candidates into consideration who does not have any referral from the industry.
It would be better if there were shown that how many applicants for the job postings have been applied. 
It would be better if the recruitment process is faster and the applicant know their application status easily
"It would be better if the job openings are categorised into their job level (Entry, mid-level, etc)"
"it would be better if the interview can allow more time to discuss the all working experience of the candidate, rather than 30 mins interview to make judgement of the candidate. effective interview should be around 1 hour. thanks "
"It would be better if the applicant has an option to edit his/her application by going back to previous steps. In my case, I was supposed to upload a cover letter after I finished the last step but to, my surprise, my application was already submitted. "
It would be better if Org hierarchy and Salary (Budget) are also revealed in the job post
"It would be better if Johnson & Johnson can provide the number of day for CV review and feedback so that the candidate aware for better arrangement.
"
"It would be better if J&J provide an anticipated schedule of recruiting process to the participants, so the participant does not need to be anxious about the uncertainty."
"It would be better and knowable by jobseeker if job vacancies in J&J are also posted in campus career website and job search engine such as jobstreet and jobsDB.
It would be better if the recruitment flow process could be described in your website."
It would be appreciated if you could provide the status/the progress of the recruitment.
"It would also be better if Johnson and Johnson recruitment team would accept open applications wherein one can submit his resume anytime even without any available position yet. By the time there will be a vacant position, the team would them choose from the open applicants of who among them best fits the job."
It works well.
"It won't be wise to judge a candidate's potential just by looking at CV only. There are many hidden qualities, passion and dedication in some candidates crucially beneficial for your organisation but unfortunately they are missed out of your shortlisting by the hasty screening. For example, I am determined to make my career and grow with this renowned company by putting all my expertise and experience of 41 years of my professional career mainly in Radiopharmaceuticals industry but I have so far been filtered out!"
It will help for J&J to periodic update the candidates on the status of their applications.
"It will better if you can provide the status of the application as well in the candidate profile. Currently, it does not mention if one's application is under consideration or not, interview status etc. "
It will be well appreciated if I were given more information on the reason why I was not selected for the position that I applied for.  This will be a leverage for my improvement.  
It will be very helpful if the preliminary hiring process can be through skype. It will definitely save time and money from both end.
It will be very early to give my opinion.
"It will be nice if the applicant gets some personal response, even though if the recruiter is not considering the application. "
"It will be nice if recruiter is able to inform candidates if their application is successful or not. 

Alternatively, it will be good to set a X number of days to know if the application is successful. E.g. I just applied for Procter and Gamble role, and the auto-email reply did mention that I will wait for 30 days and after which if no one contacts me, it means my application has failed. At least this sets my expectation to wait 30 days. "
It will be my pleasure to work with you.
It will be much greater if there's a preelementary test for all aplicants
It will be more intuitive if there is any mechanism to inform the candidate of their current status of application.   
"It will be helpful to see the standard timeline and next steps. 
Thank you. "
It will be helpful that if I get the information about the progress of my application. 
It will be helpful If we get communication with update on progress of application by phone/sms/Email.
"It will be great to have more information about the recruitment process, maybe a feedback if what to improve. It will be great to know the opportunities for people that need sponsorship from the company. Thanks for the opportunity. "
"It will be great if the applicant can recive updates on the recruitment process. For example, I have not heard back and has no idea if i am still part of the process for the role"
It will be great if Johnson & Johnson can give a receiving note to its candidates when it receives their applications and provide feedback to those short-listed candidates once it kicks off the screening and interview processes.    
It will be good if the company can indicate if a prospective employee job application is accepted or rejected.  To reduce the anxiety of waiting 
It will be good if the candidates can be informed whether they are shortlisted / suitable for the job position applied.  
"It will be good if I get to know about 

1) the local working culture specific to the site of application.

2) Knowing the hierarchy

3) if it is a new or replacement position"
"It will be decided on the basis of participation 
in interview process. "
It will be better to give a feedback to candidate as faster as possible.
It will be better if this survey has a Chinese version hhhhhh~
It will be better if the process can be quick. Thank you. 
"it will be better if Johnson & Johnson can response back to the applicant quicker. Such as yes, no or when to come to the interview. This will allow the applicant to make plans for their coming future career."
"It will be a dream come true if i get opportunity to work with Johnson & Johnson.
Looking forward to hear from you.
Thanks."
It was quite simple and fluid. Easy to fill in
It was probably the easiest application process I have done and I have gone through so many recently! 
It was just right! Thanks 
it was good enough
It was easy to access and apply for the position and this kind of survey makes me more be comfortable.
It was disappointing to see that there was absolutely no response  (neither positive nor negative) after the application. I believe my profile was a close and excellent fit to be at least considered for an evaluation. I really look forward to hearing back from Johnson & Johnson.
It was a great process to apply for a position online. Don't think any betterment is required 
It varies company to company this one to be discuss internally with teamets 
It took a long time to know if I am being shortlisted for an interview. No progress update from the company. 
It takes time to get feedback.
"It takes more talented people to have an interview, and people can learn to grow。            thank you for reading my advice     Wangzan"
"It takes long time (over 3 weeks) to receive feedback (no matter how positive or negative it is) from recruitment team. In fact, nothing at all except an formulaic auto-notification email. It makes candidate feel in the dark and not respect, I just wonder whether people will review my resume as ""first come first serve"" or not.

In a nut shell, good or bad, we deserve to know how J&J reacts to our interest with your company. Thanks."
It should move the process at faster pace
"It should have a review page, instead of automatically submit the application form soon after we finish the last form page."
"it should give some warning about deception about offering job in Johnson & Johnson
give some reply for not long time "
"It should get more background details from the candidate like education, working experience, family, hobbies, etc that the employer could get some ideas and impression about the candidate. Thank you very much."
It Should Be simple and crystal clear
It should be fast and updating to us.
It should be fast and fair.
It should be fast
it should be fast 
It should be a lot of Jobs
It should be a fast pace process as I consider time is money.. Once selected then training immediately we should start the work to improve the profitability of the company 
"It shall be in a short time period since some people need to have a job quickly, mainly for fresh graduate."
It shall be good to know the various stages / rounds of interview candidate has to undergo in the us more clear. 
It seems the recruitment process is good for me. 
It provide direct contact and provide time frame for selection for CV or recruitment time.
It need to minimise the time of Recruiting process. 
it might be update the recruitment process with candidate as much. Thanks :)
"It might be better to organize more campus seminars and update the positions in time.
Thanks!"
It may provide the better and faster the recruitmnet for an applicant. 
It may be a good idea to also mention industry equivalent grades/designation as reference to any given job title.
"It is very to to gather opinion what applier considering of this new position suitable, however I think it is better to conduct survey right after submission."
It is very rigorous but a slow process (in my experience). Speeding it up will be better for the business in the long term. 
it is very good from my current perspective
"It is very difficult to receive an interview with JNJ. I have sent so many resumes over the years where I am more than qualified and always get rejected. It seems as if they are roles that are posted internally and no one outside JNJ gets them, or maybe you need to write a specific wording as your presentation so that the system accepts it. Not sure if an actual person reviews it or the system does or the person reviewing them from a different department not the one of the role does not have the thorough experience to fully evaluate an ideal candidate for it, because I really find it impossible with my high level vast expertise, I always get rejected for any role."
It is streamlined process and it is a great experience for an institution like Johnson and Johnson to ask for a feedback from one of the candidate.It brings out the importance such company places on an individual outlook and that what makes it perfect.
It is still good enough.
It is so far excellent !!
"It is recommended to study comparative with another company even you have a good recruitment materials but it's not enough. If you would like to improve the pontential candidate through the recruitment process in your company, pls go to find some comparation with another huge companies in Indonesia."
It is perfect process but I feel after applying the post at least one telepohnic round is require for better understanding about the process.
"It is not possible matching 100% candidates working Job description with employers for a new job role. when ever shortlisting a candidate do consider his qualifications, exposure & previous work experience with different organisations.

thanks & regards-Kishore Gondrala

"
"It is important to select right candidate for the required position. 
For selection of right candidate, I would suggest not to select on the basis of race, country or religion but instead of check the capabilities, knowledge, skills and team working ability of the candidate."
It is highly appreciated if a MT sharing video can attach to give a more realistic and in-depth sharing from a current employee. This enhances the interest of suitable candidates.
It is great already!
"It is good to include some questions that help looking into the character of a person, like personality questionnaires. This helps to provide brief idea of whether the candidate is suitable to the company culture or the role. "
It is good nothing improvement will require.
"It is good in terms of easy process in application and detail descriptions on the role.

However, it still needs to improve in 2 aspects, I believe
1) update personally on the result of the application.
    I prefer to send to personal mail. but if not working, at least clearly state on the career page. but currently it is difficult to know my status in career page

2) It would be much favourable if J&J can provide in what aspect I am weak and whether I am in a pool of highly talent and potential or just one of the normal candidates. That will be helpful for me to apply next time.

Thanks!"
It is good as it is now.
It is good
It is following a good path for recruitment process
"It is difficult for me to suggest as  I am not aware of recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson.
But, I am quite satisfied with the recruitment process as Johnson and Johnson is quick in response of my application.
"
"It is clear Job description and professional survey.
so, I think it seems perfect!"
"it is better to report lots of pages (e.g. people & job, pharmamedi, saramin and etc.) the position for the recent graduate."
"it is better to inform the application result as soon as possible, whether we can join Johnson & Johnson or not. Actually, there is no further information about my application as supply chain management trainee. I really hope this problem will be fixed in the near future, so that nobody will wait such a long time jobless or in doubts about the probability of joining Johnson and Johnson. 
Thank You."
"It is better if we can save the draft of recruitment steps and it is better to give a glance environmental situation like full, of tension or moderate or not. "
It is better if the process is faster than current one.
It is bad to have a potential employer who send an experience survey invitation to failed job candidates without telling them that they have failed the job application. 
"It is already the good recruitment process, more the awarness  about vacancies and positions will give good and talented Candidates to the organisation."
"It is already pretty much defined ,no need to improve as such."
It is already good
"It is already enough and good, but it would be better if the working hours and salary is posted and more specific description of the role. Thank you."
It is above criticism.
"It is above average good, excellent."
it is a well organized process
It is a simple and straight forward process.
"It is a quite longer process, You really need to cut it into a pretty smaller way,like you should take resume first if you think the person has a 40-50% chances to get this particular job than ask her/him to complete the further procedure.
Thank you."
"It is a little difficult to say, as I had been turned down in the early stage of the process (resume screening) and have not seen the entire process. However, providing means for the candidate to submit their information via recruitment portal in the beginning of the application process provides a very positive impression of J&J from candidate perspective that the company has very structured approach in recruitment (candidate selection) process."
It is a good process.
It is a bit complicated to find a detailed description of each job. Easier process would be helpful for job seekers.
"It is a best process, Not required any improvements process for recruitment. Thanks "
It is a  fair process of recruitment organised by J&J .The improvements are required only in term of  fast response time to the applicants.
It is @ best....
It has unique process for selection. One in its own kind. Best!!
"It has been one month since my application and this email. To someone actively searching for a job, these questions are hard to answer since It's been a while since the actual application process. If this survey would be sent out three days to a week later would be more appropriate. The process as I recall was pretty standard. "
It has been a week since my application and I am not sure if I have been shortlisted for the position or have been rejected. I would certainly appreciate a note of rejection if it is the latter case. 
It has been a smooth process to apply online so far.However cannot comment on the full process since haven't been through the entire process of interviews with Johnson and Johnson.
"It has been a few weeks since I applied but I have not received any updates as to the process. Considering the employment brand, I would expect there would be an automated system in use which could atleast provide if the process was active on a fortnightly basis."
It had a great improvement compare to 2 years ago for the online process.
It does well on recruitment process.
"It could inform us which stage of the recruitment Johnson & Johnson is at, so that the applicant is better updated."
It could be bit easy while they explain about the recruitment process for the role so that it will be easy for us to make ourselves convinent..
It could be better if the process notice automatically to applicants about procedure status. Thanks.
it co is very good.
It can workout on recruitment process because its been so long that i have registered my application and got the response this late. I was waiting for it from so long and had lose my hope to be part of it. But glad to see the revert and hope that it replies on time or within 1-2 days. 
It can provide me the right opportunity identifying my skills and my talent to work with it.  
It can provide feedback to the candidates once the process is done.
It can improve the turn around time for the job applications.
It can be more fast
It can be little bit faster. Also the application process can be little bit faster; if I have to upload my resume then whats the need of feeling databases additionally? I think its consuming extra time which is very valuable for a working professional.
It can be filter through General intelligence questionnaire during filling the application. 
"Is the process generally longer, can it be shortened? Very important, everyone is looking for a job."
Is it possible to send the candidates emails even if they are not suitable for the position? Thanks.
"IQ tests, interviews, and tests in accordance with the position of application"
Invite more candidates for an interview
"Invite me to meet for an interview, and disregard my age and race"
Invite me in for an interview rather than request me to complete a survey.

"Introducing an application tracking mechanism for the candidates. Typically if a candidate is looking at change, they would be considering multiple opportunities and not knowing much about about the process & progress in one does not help the process."
Interview process is fast. Good job! Keep it up!!

"In the recruitment process and us, candidates would probably check first the employer's career sites, we are looking for ideas, stories, news and all that about the company that we are applying for. This is in order for us to identify whether  we really are into pursuing our career with you and in order for the company as well to identify who is capable and really fits on the job and most especially the culture of the company. So, more blogs, news updates about Johnsons and Johnsons, about the people inside the company, and everything that shows how well the company is doing, that starts a transparent communication between the company and the best candidate of the job."
"In the process of recruitment, I hope that the hiring team will respond as soon as possible to the applicants to notify them of their application status. It will give them an idea of what to do whether to prepare for the next step of the recruitment process for Johnson and Johnson or to find opportunities in other companies"
"In the languages section the only options available were korean and mandarin. There was no option to select neither, the type of fluency or simply english. This could be rectified so that applicants can give the correct information as one could not move ahead in the application without selection one of the mentioned languages."
"In the event that the process is not going forward, candidate should be intimated.

Even if through an automated rejection mail, at least the candidate knows where they stand in the process, instead of being hopeful without cause."
"In order to recruit Korean talent, Johnson & Johnson should make a homepage in Korean. "
"In order to improve recruitment process, I am suggesting to post more employment ads in different job seeking websites. Also to encourage current employees to give review to the company so that job seekers will have idea how great the company is. "
"In order to apply for the referred position the candidate has to access J & J site by entering the user-id/password provided to the candidate.However in my case the user-id/password combination did not work & I could not apply using this recruiting process. I tried reaching concerned persons for resolution of my issue & also conveyed my issue to the J&J employee who referred my name, who in turn contacted the team who take care of access issues. Till date I have not received any response & I am unable to apply."
"In my view, it would be appreciated to send a rejection letter to applicants who have not been selected for a position. Not all companies do so. "
In my view j&j has good recruitment process already.i will give my point after joining this company.
In my point of view they should also 3rd party interview as neutral body for candidature.
In my own opinion I think the recruitment team must have an essay part max of 500 words where the applicant can tell more about his/herself. In order for the team to know more about the applicant since they will just contact the applicant through phone calls. Thank you.
"In my opinion，the recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson was very innovative and reasonable.Through this talent reserve model, Johnson & Johnson can get more job seekers information, but also allows more understanding between  job seekers andJohnson. I hope that Johnson & Johnson can pay more attention to the job seekers job trends and needs, and employer can have more communication with job seekers, just gave graduate students more opportunities to try.Therefore, I look forward to one day be able to receive the offer of Johnson & Johnson."
In my opinion，communication is the best way for people to know each other.  The company could give more opportunities to interviewers. we should deny a person's other talent by his school.
"in my opinion, the recruitment process is very  rational and effective, so basically you might keep the current process.
It would be better to let the applicants know the current recruitment status easily to keep their motivations high. 
* No updated informations have been known since my application. 

Does my answer meet your expectations?"
"In my opinion, The recruitment process is generally OK.

However, Resume submission check and modification function is not clear.

If only this point is complemented, I think it's better than ever.

I pray for an eternal prosperous development of Johnson & Johnson .

Thank you!"
"In my opinion, the process was smooth and intuitive, up to a point. However, I do wish that the acquisition team would contact the applicants sooner or even equally because my peers received a feedback regarding their application whereas I did not. I think they need to improve on that, in a way where: 1) the applicants will know if their application/profile has been viewed, 2) the applicants are contacted whether they passed the screening or not, 3) they are given due explanation as to why not they are considered etc. I think that in this way, the process becomes personal BUT objective, the company benefits, the employee/applicant benefits."
"In my opinion, the process is very structured and clear to applicants. 
The only improvement area I can see for the moment is the feedback. The speed of feedback is very critical for the applicant, thus providing it in very short lead time will be very convenient.

Karim"
"In my opinion, the company could be more interactive and perhaps provide an active status on the recruitment process. This would be for example, by having an active update of whether application is in consideration or not. 

Additionally, given the background of the company, a graduate recruitment program for some positions would be lucrative. It would not be unfair to say that many graduates without experience would still be competent and highly talented. Moreover, a personal contact with the company at the location applied would be supportive to provide a further insight into the application and perhaps, how it could be improved for future applications. "
"In my opinion, the application part of the recruitment process is very seamless. From the job ad leading to the company website to being able to monitor our progress status as we complete the application form. And Johnson & Johnson should continue with this. 

I am currently waiting to hear back on my application status (ie. whether I am granted a first interview) hence I will not be able to share any experience or whether any improvements can be made. A suggestion would be to inform applicants if their application is not successful (that's only in case this is not already being done)"
"In my opinion, it is better to talk job/position description more details at 1st phone interview invitation instead of just inviting/scheduling for the interview. "
"In my opinion this recruitment process you have already was good. 
But I have suggestion if Johnson & Johnson can have interview face to face besides having the online assesment, maybe Johnson & Johnson already have the interview with some candidates you want them to join, but I think it will be nice also to give the other applicants chance to have interview. Because it would be different when the applicant only answer the online assesment without knowing who she/he really is as a real. Knowing the applicants personality and insight are important.

That's my suggestion of the recruitment process, I wish Johnson & Johnson can improve the recruitment process and give chance to the other applicants who want to join.



Best Regards,
Hillary Maria Venessa Sabrina"
In my opinion the recruitment process appears to be fairly good enough.
In my opinion the process of recruitment should be faster. 
"In my opinion if applicant get preliminary result  within seven days of applying the job that he/ she has been shortlisted for interview, also consider candidates worldwide with relocation facility.  "
In my opinion good candidates and profiles may be ignored/missed due to the practice of key words based scanning of the CVs. The algorithm for these words should be more job relevant so that the rejection happens at the stage where the candidate is found to be inadequately equipped to handle the role as opposed to missing a few words in the resume. The application process is very intuitive and easy. So thumbs up on that! Cheers! 
In my knowledge Johnson and Johnson already has the best recruitment process.
"In my humble opinion, you should focus on people living abroad. Need to have of course background and skills for the job but someone who's avalaible to leave is own country and comfort zone to go on a life project... that person will be for sure one of the best with the personality and skills that you guys want; ambicious, fearless, positive, winner!"
"In meantime i am not aware about the recruitment process how they are doing. I think talent acquisition is a good process by applying on career job portal. Most of companies are doing in such a way.

In getting back to candidate as soon as possible with either good or bad news. 
"In general, the market review of J&J as employer is very favourable. As for the recruitment process, prompt feedback on the status to the candidates would help."
"In general, all recruitment team should not just look at applicants CV they should give everyone a chance to be known and understood as not everyone are good in selling their selves but are very good when it comes to doing the actual job. Skills are learnt but not attitude."
"In fact, I think the recruitment is very formal and the process is complete. This whole process give me good impression of J&J. I hope the waiting time can be shoetend so that the recruirment will be more efficient. 
Last but not leasr, J&J is very good company and I' ll be excied if I get the opportunity."
"In digital era I things we should do maximum utilization internet manner. We can post the job advertising at jobs board like Jobs DB etc. Furthermore we do the same whether at face book, linkedin, company web, job fair etc. For faster and better result we can develops recruitment team in each department as HR empowerment. Provides good training and clear guidance to ensure proper execution also prepares recognition if necessary. On my opinion we no needs third party support like head hunter partner just bother company budget also ineffective way. Refer from Indonesian Demography, we have about 255 million population with more than a hundred million as internet user. Most job seeker do actively search through internet facility to get jobs information by minute, they have good skill about social media utilization."

"In case of not fitting to the applied role or positions, candidates resume can be matched to toher openings time to time and should be intimated to the candidate even if he is failing to view J&J website on regular basis"
In case CV is not shortlisted candidate should get a mail informing him/ her about that.
"In case application rejected,the applicant should be informed."
"in addition to advertising through electronic media, and through the announcement on the website of a private company"
"In a few ways the whole process was a little unpersonal. There is no direct connection I could make as an applicant with the people I would actually work with. To lose this feeling of randomly sending an application to a big company, a more personal aproach in form of a contact directly conneted with the job a person applies, for would be a huge plus."

"I've noticed that the job application portal has streamlined as compare to before, that's good for the company as I believe they receive more applicants apply for each position. Of course, on the C level positions, it might need to set more requirements and questions for the J&J job application online portal; so the first screening is done through the portal which ease the HR personnel to proceed to the next recruitment process. "
I've never been contacted by Johnson & Johnson after submitting my application? 
"I've just reached the phone interview level and so far so good. I think it would be better to keep the applicants updated on a weekly basis on the job opening that they are applying for, like giving updates to those waiting for the opening of asia and australia accounts. "
"I've applied for this post quite some time back via the online portal as well as an email to hrservices_sg@its.jnj.com. To date, I've not received any response on the progress of it. Will be good if there's some form of indication on how long does one expect to receive a reply, be it it's still in the process, not successful etc. Thanks. "
"I'm still waiting for a recruiter to contact me so I prefer to wait for that stage to give any recommendation.
I really appreciate the effectiveness of the online application process."
I'm satisfied in current process.
I'm ready for the next test will be carried out at any time. Thanks.
"I'm pretty impressed with J&J career website, e.g.,  the detailed job description, the required skills and critical success factors, etc.  Perhaps the only thing missing is having some visibility of the status of my application; but I suppose it may not be feasible given the volume of applications that J&J is processing."
I'm not sure why I'm answering this survey. Did i get the job or not? :)
I'm looking forward to join Johnson & Johnson.
I'm have criteria for Key Account Manager for Johnson & Johnson and i can do better for Company 
"I'm good with the recruitment process, although I have not yet been advised about the status of my application (which was 10 days ago) maybe they can improve their speed of response, a candidate’s chances of finding a position are much greater when we have open lines of communication."
"I'm actually surprised to receive this survey request as this was the first communication after I submitted the application, I thought it should have Ben sent to poeple after thy go through an interview"
I'll do my best 
I'd like to suggest JnJ to participate into job fair event so we can get more access to apply
I'am still awaiting feedback on my application and its been 3 weeks already. It would be great if you could provide the same within a week or so
I would very much appreciate for Johnson & Johnson to update the candidates on the outcome of their screening interview. 
"I would suggest to HR team to provide a feedback, I even if not positive, to the candidates after the interview. In another application, I went thru first interview round with the HR, but after the interview, I did not receive a feedback. "
I would suggest to conduct some skill based questions to initiate the primary screening process.
"I would Suggest the process should be more easy by calling Walk-in interviews for the desire experience candidates, Now a day candidates are not getting the job in their particular field of education so these so not happened.

"I would suggest that the applicant or the person who will be interviewed over the phone should be informed first via sms or email prior to the call. In this manner the recruiter and the applicant will be on the same phase at the same time, and that the applicant will sure to answer the call, because he/she knows or expect a call from Johnson and Johnson.

Thanks,

Richard"
"I would suggest that Johnson & Johnson provide the applicants feedback for their application. Though I have applied in Johnson & Johnson several times, I have never heard back anything. A genuine feedback helps candidate to analyse their candidature."
I would suggest screening process should happen taking candidates from diverse but same functional domain. Ex: Sales and marketing is mostly common in related field and can be worked out best with different strategy and the type of cleint we are dealing with at a given point of time. Thanks for opportunity. 
I would suggest improving the processing time of the recruitment process. I think it takes longer time in this process.
"I would recommend a pre-screening process right after a candidate's application for a position. This is can be done by a web application, containing pre-screening questions of which the answers hold value for Johnson & Johnson. This will help increase efficiency of recruitment team in screening the best fit candidate."
I would really like to go through the recruitment process and be able to provide this feedback
I would prefer fewer steps to submit the application
I would like to suggest that a way to deliver/relay any progressions of one's application be considered. I'm still waiting for news to be honest. :)
"I would like to see a ""real person"" sending emails and providing updates on application status instead of an automated email."
I would like to recommend that they ahould at least give us a chance for interview because expressing ourselves that what i do and what I could do will be determined by that only
I would like to put my thought as J&J could improve on phone discussion with the candidate before hiring. So that the candidate can get a clear view about his responsibilities and roles he's gonna play. And it would give him confidence that the company is serious on hiring the candidate.
I would like to know why i was rejected. not only me but also any other applicant wonder about it.if you let us know we can make throughgoing preparations for next opportunity that join to J&J.
I would like to know the outcome of my application. 
"I would like to know and have an interview that goes beyond a filter process.

There are many things I would like to address. An interview would allow me to demonstrate my passion and motivation to work at JNJ.

I would like a feedback if I was selected for the role and if not what is the reason behind it.
I would appreciate a swifter response on the application
I wish there were ways where we can reach the recruiter or email the hiring manager as well.
I wish recruitment process will be faster than before and there are several offline test in this recruitment process. 
I wish Johnson and Johnson can provide us applicants a feedback regarding our application status whether good or bad
I wish I could get a feedback about being selected or not. I Think this survey doesn't represent the result of my application.
I wish HR and line manager can communicate with candidate directly and give me feedback after I apply and interview. 
I will suggest that JNJ can include more company culture matters into thd recruitmsnt process in order to deliver a positive value and take it as Employer Branding. - Annabelle Zhou
I will request you to give chance a chance to the eligible candidate to attain the interview process from their present location through Skype or telephonic process as a result many eligible candidate can get the chance to attain the interview. And J&J can get best group of employee. 
I will provide u a better software for recruit ur new employees..
I will have to study or know your current recruitment process before making any suggestions
I will give my comments in interview.
"I was very proud when being part of johnson & johnson, and could build the company into a more advanced and high-income terintegritas I expected"
"I was treated as an individual. There was one person interviewing rather than a panel. The interview was essentially two parties getting to know one another which I found personable and alleviated nervousness. 
I would like some more information on conditions of work in terms of hours, pay and expectation. That's really about it. 
Thank you "
I was the maternity cover for this role and was listed as the preferred candidate so this survey is somewhat redundant in my case
"I was not successful in my application, given the speed of my response I am assuming that my cv didn't get past the initial screening. More specific feedback would have been appreciated. Although I don't hold a medical qualification,I have held a medical director position in GSK consumer healthcare previously and so have relevant experience. If a medical qualification was mandatory then it would have helped to state this in the job advert. "
I was not interview yet.
"I was just hoping if someone not suitable then Johnson & Johnson inform the candidate, so they didn't wait too long."
I was impressed the Johnson & Johnson' hiring process for the candidate because the candidate exactly can understand the role and objectives for the open position so I want to get the opportunity for interview with Johnson & Johnson.  
"I was called for an initial interview once, however the timing was not good because i am busy at work. I politely asked if the HR can call me again at the agreed time. But i did not recieve a call ever again after that. I feel sorry for myself for not being able to take that shot. But I feel like the HR should've given me a follow up. "
"I was approached for this role, I was told I would be put forward for the National am role however it was taken by the time Victoria interviewed me for the Territory role that I was over qualified for.please consider peoples time and ensure applicants,are contacted before interviews go ahead if positions are taken thank you. "
I was an internal candidate. Just that the process could be better by atleast providing some feedback to the applicants. I haven't heard back.
I wanted you to describe necessary English skills more clearly.
I wanted to know the process and how many interviews I have in advance (I assumed that I will be taken 1 on 1 interview but there's 1 on 2 interviews twice actually.
I want you to let me check my application process status on this web.
I want to get job in this great company
I want J&J to explain about the rejection or acceptance. If there is some reason for that decision. Thanks.
I Understand，recruitment process can take time but it also means losing a good candidate. Please make the Process duration shorter and help job seekers to be updated on internal status of their profile.
I understand they can improve on reaching the high profile candidates to brief them if they are not qualified for the post or if something can be improved for later openings.
"I understand that J&J recruit quite a lot of new employees as a leading pharmaceutical company, I would appreciate that I could have more feed back from the recruiting department, either from my applying position or HR."
I truly appreciate HR taking the time to to provide candidates with updated information on the status of their application. My advice would be to continue doing so. It encourages applicants to return to the Johnson & Johnson career website and apply to different positions.
"I thought Johnson & Johnson recruitment process is better than other companies one.
Current system is very good for me. 
because I've regularly updated my resume and cover letter, then could upload file on the recruitment system simply and easily ."
I thought it was a very smooth process and did not see any problems.
"I thought I was going for a position with Abbott Optics/Vision not with Johnson & Johnson.

Was informed by the recruiter that Johnson & Johnson had acquired Abbott Optics/Vision. "
"I think, when someone already completed the 7-steps of general profile, and already put their resume/cv/anything the company needs. No need to show the same interface for the next login. Whenever I login to the website (jnc.taleo.net) I always face the same user interface and asked to fill out the 7-steps of general profile. I think it no use."
"I think, this process should not be suggestable by us."
"I think, the status update on the application should be shared with the candidate."
"I think, selecting the candidate is not just by the experience or by the score. but, you can considerate the soft skill too. "
"I think, it will be helpful if the recruitment process will invite the applicant in person as soon as the online application is done. Thank you and may God bless you all."
I think your recruitment system is so reasonable and good for applicants
"I think your company should have any test first ,after if they can pass the test , you will make another process that is interviews."
"I think you should visualize the application steps through creating video or infographic. It will help candidates understand the process easily and enhace your company's image: more dynamic and friendly.

"
I think you need more explaination about the hiring job position. thanks.
I think you may announcing more channels that would be good.
I think you can have a demonstration session to show your candidates how to use your products and how important your products are for making lives better. Then the applicants understand your products and you can hire those who really want to join J&J. 
I think to improve the recruitment process is emphasize and make it more efficient to the person who wan to apply to the job they want.
I think this survey can actually be included in the last section of the recruitment process.
I think this online recruitment process is okay. The questions are simple and intuitive.
I think this is a very easy and better recruitment process. Nothing improvement is require.
I think they should have a Job Fair around metro manila to easily access the place that the others can't be able to come on the head office 
"I think these are the better steps to be taken for recuritment process:
1)Forget trying to ask magic bullet questions
2) Ensure you have clearly defined what it will take to be successful in the position
3) Test candidates
4) Include others in the hiring process."
"I think there is scope of improvement as single resume upload should be allowed for multiple profiles. Also, there should be some update on the process even if it is negative."
I think the things that JnJ should need to do for better recruitment is by describe clearly how is the criteria of the candidate that need so it will easier the next recruitment process to get the best candidate for that position.
I think the right &  suitable candidates should be called for interview .
I think the response from the moment I applied was very quick. I appreciated that. Although I was rejected it helped me move on. When responding to a candidate whether to decline or offer next steps of screening it would be great to have the title of the job on the mail. I applied to several positions but I didn't know exactly which one at which location I was turned down to.
I think the reply you provide to people for recruitment are late there might be people out looking for urgent jobs and when they don't get fast replies from companies career website they start finding on other sources that might mislead so i request you to reply back with the vacancy and recruitment   process.
I think the recruitment process was really nice. But the process and the respon should be faster. 
I think the recruitment process is very intuitive and simple. So I could apply to Johnson  & Johnson easily. Thank you.
I think the recruitment process is very clear and straight. 
I think the recruitment process is good but if you can describe more clearly the opportunities that the candidate will have when working at the company. Thank you!
I think the recruitment process is good and it will be advantage if recruiters as soon as possible make a date to interview the jobseekers
I think the recruitment process is already great
I think the recruitment process has been very good and thorough. Johnson and Johnson are clearly determined to recruit the right people and this is evident in the recruitment process.
I think the recruitment process from Johnson & Johnson is the best I've ever seen.
"I think the process was seamless, integrating with linked in might be something to consider. "
I think the process via an agent was enough good!
I think the process is very good.
I think the process is already well streamlined and at this moment I cannot think of any improvements required.
I think the most important thing that the applicant must know is the transparency between employee-employer relationship.
"I think the major part lies with the recruiter for giving a clarity on things.Even if there are many people for a certain post and you are yet to reject or select you must put that across to applicants for them to have a realistic hope.
I also believe one should be given a fair chance, a person may not be handling a certain role but may have the flair and skill set that fits that role and just because the exact role doesn't reflect in the professional experience ,the person isn't considered.
I think to understand that better one must pick cues from the resume and also cross check with the posts you have and you never know who is the next Einstein.
Sometimes it is just that perfect combination of role and the person that works wonders for both the employer and the employee."
I think the it will be great if J&J may send an email to the candidate to inform about the status of the application. 
"I think the improvement needed would be to have a recruitment portal that can store information and show the status of the job seeker if it is approve, denied or under evaluation in its job application."
"I think the current recruitment process is good enough. Through the stream interview, it could achieve to the effect of face to face interview. Moreover, it is more convenient for the one who is still in-service."
"I think the current recruitment process is good enough however, I'd like to suggest that hiring a talent from Pakistan requires more screening of the candidates. It would be great if J&J talent acquisition sets up some sort of telephonic interview for the candidates just like Uber and other foreign companies are doing to bring talent on board. 

Looking forward to working with J&J.

Regards,
Adil"
I think the current process is fine.
I think the Company should speed up the online application screening and revert to the candidate on the result within 2 weeks. It will update the candidate with the status of the applied vacancies.
I think the company is in the right process to recruit people to right position as they deserve it on the merits.
"I think the company is doing well as far as recruitment is concerned.the company should inform the candidates through a mail regarding the selection or rejection result. The company is good in all the aspects. 
Regards
Ankit"
I think the company has given good communication by keeping in touch. May be you should give more exposure on how great environment workin in the company. Thanks for the email
"I think that the introduction of open ended character, experience and motivational questions would definitely increase the quality of prospective applicants. 
"
I think that Johnson & Johnson recognize candidates skills and talent so nothing is there for the same.
"I think that it would be better if this position could be promoted more, like a video that shows what the experience of a management trainee would be in Johnson & Johnson."
I think that is important to do an interview to evaluate to candidate in cases of international students 
I think that has been done very well and was very helpful in finding a job applicants with experience and jobs.
I think that email confirmation received right after submit my application was on time. And I appreciate this survey giving candidates chance to tell the company more about themselves. My experience with Johnson & Johnson so far is all positive.
I think that can improve the efficiency of the recruitment and hiring time should look at is not the ability to record of formal schooling
"i think still more questions based on judging the candidate should be asked so that recruitment process will be easy to decide to hire the candidate or not. Its just my point of view....

Thank you for this survey."
"I think Sells,better service,convenient to coutomer."
I think recruitment process used by Johnson & Johnson is very transparent and effective. So I fully satisfied with recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson team.
"I think recruitment process should not only be based on the previous experience. It should be based also on the capacity to do work and on the skills that the candidate can prove, maybe beyond his/her limitations to do the job."
"i think recruitment process of JOHNSON AND JOHNSON is excellent there is no need for any improvement,"
"i think process is very lucid & not much been added, but i think J & J HR must meet every professional whose CV has been shortlist. People have big dream hope from J & J like i am.so i wanted it, because meeting face to face reflect the required skills for doing perfect job"
I think process is good. So no recommendations now. It will be based on further communications.
"I think people who are hardwoeking and ready to take various opportunity should be selected rather than the grading and top schools and colleges pass out.

Thanks
Warm Regards

"i think Johnson and Johnson already have  a very good way of recruitment, once we applied for the join, company revert the candidate. this is a very positive way to do a recruitment."
I think Johnson & Johnson's recruitment process is good considering the prompt response I received via email and this survey form that targets the concerns of the applicant. Thank you.
"I think Johnson & Johnson was give their best recruitment process to all the candidates, as one of the companies that I think is good for our career path in the future. maybe by generating pop up on the first page of Johnson & Johnson website about the job offer information, all candidates can easily apply for all the job vacancy.

"I think Johnson & Johnson recruitment process is good, but maybe I suggest to do a virtual recruitment. Like virtual interview, virtual assesment, etc. It can be make easier to HRD for candidate assesment process. Thankyou."
I think Johnson & Johnson is one of the company with the best recruitment process.
"I think Johnson & Johnson is doing good in this recruitment process.
I have some suggests.
The first is the company can interview the job seeker in the place that is near to the interviewee if conditions permit.
我是一名应届大学生，我更希望我的目标公司如果认为我没有戏，可以马上告诉我，这样更加直截了当。
最后，强生是一家非常棒的公司
"
I think Johnson & Johnson have one of the best recruitment process as of today. I don't have any suggestions. 
"I think Johnson & Johnson do a good recruitment process. Simple, easy to apply in desktop or mobile view. 

"
"I think J&J has already had a very good selection system, quick response to every step of application is awesome. Meanwhile, the resume upload still a bit confusing for me because there's no maximum time we can upload.
"
I think its up the the mark.
I think its better to hire those individuals who can take the company to next level. 
I think it's fine and clear:)
I think it's already pretty straightforward and simple compared to other companies. Well done!
I think it would be great if Johnson & Johnson can speed up in their resume reviewing process. Thank you :)
I think it would be better if Johnson&Johnson create campus hiring for some reputable universities to spot talent.
"I think it will be good for J&J to indicate the progress of the application. 

Apologies for the late reply, I was on vacation last week."
I think it was easy and smooth 
I think it is up to the mark. Thank you
I Think It is the best recruitment process followed by the organization.
I think it is quite hard to figure out the experience and knowledge of each candidates though document screening. I hope suitable candidates will be given opportunities in job interviews.
I think it is pretty much streamlined. However a candidate who applies for a position expects a quick turnaround and feedback. Any delay over a week is dissatisfying issue and right candidates may get better jobs. 😊
"I think it is ok, because J&J are very famous, So if someone know J&J, He or she would pay much attention about J&J company. So I think it is ok. For J&J, the interviewer would very much want to enter into the J&J, So they must show their advantage side, That would save J&J's time. Hope I could enter into J&J, Gold bless me. Thank you"
"I think it is less complicated as compared to many other online recruitment processes where they ask for a video of self-introduction. While I think a video interview is perfectly fine, the video of self-introduction to be attached to the application may not be the best platform to showcase a person's confidence, or simply whatever the recruiter is looking for. That's just my opinion. So while I have not yet figured out what JnJ can do to improve the recruitment process because it is relatively simpler and self-explanatory, it is good that the company has not included a video component. "
"I think it is better for J&J to add the question: ""Tell me about your best experience during your college"".
Just to know how that person thinks and what he/she has accomplished."
i think it is a good.
"I think it can increae more ways to check one's ability,such as video,telephone and so on."
"I think I would prefer to be better informed on the recruitment process (which stage I'm on and how long should I wait for next step). Otherwise, I believe the recruitment team is professional in everything."
"I think I would need to go through the entire recruitment process before I can give possible recommendations on how the process can be further improved. At this point, I don't have much to say."
"I think I have been applying for J&J vacancies for quite sometime now. However, it is not even once that I have received any feedback on my application, even though it was negative. It feels that my application is somewhere lost and I will somewhere lost the inclination of applying itself!"
I think hiring should be assignment based. Each assignment should have marks & relevant with the job descriptions. 
I think everything is good enough. The explanation about the job is very clear and easy to be understood. My pleasure to fill this questionnaire.
I think current process seems to be very innovative and handy. It would be really great if we can add some basic questions to rate the expertise level for the particular job posting.
I think current process is good. 
I think current process is good enough but I think there's still always room for improvement.
I think by my opinion there is no need to change anything in the current recruitment process. 
I suggest that you may have specific timelines for the recruitment process itself.
I suggest should do online interview question and  finalize the candidate .
"I suggest J&J to try to introduce to some universities about its company profile, how good the company take care their employees, what and how the role of employees in each division, and also working environment in J&J. It will help them to open their eyes about J&J. This way may also make people interest to work in J&J. Thank you."
I suggest cancel the group interview。
I suggest a notification even you did not get the role
"I submitted my application online last February 21, 2017 and up to date I have not gotten any update yet regarding my application aside from the e-mail that tells me my application has been received. I wish you could provide quicker update/s to the applicants so we at least know where we stand — whether we are qualified or otherwise. "
I strongly believe that Johnson & Johnson has already good and reputable recruitment process. Thank you.
"I strongly agree with this recruitment process because its objectivity
"
"I strongly agree that Johnson & Johnson company is very comfortable working place.   I applied to Johnson & Johnson as a professional affairs via agency. 
Agent person strongly recommends the position that I applied, but the response is slower than I expected. If recruitment process is faster than current situation, it would be much better. 
 "
"I someone applies to the job on portal after registration, It means he/she is very much interested for the role and really want to get associated with the organisation. 
So at least he/she should get response or interviewed."
"I somehow was not considered for an interaction for the applied position of District Manager - Dermatology (1700156154W) with Johnson and Johnson. I strongly believe, I am with best of skills for the position I applied. For my diverse multi domain work experiences in sales, key account management, research and consulting with a track record of success, Johnson and Johnson missed an opportunity to hire a prospective candidate like me who is experienced, willing to work, skillful and are with multi-dimensional professional work expertise. One of Global Pharmaceutical Leader once taught me failures are necessary at times to have a better professional as well personal outlook. So I must say, the company should reach out and listen to prospective candidates, those who have seen success and failure hand in hand and looking for career options. "
"I sent my application two weeks ago, and I don't know the status of my application yet. Will I be considered for the program or not?. Perhaps response time can be improved upon."
"I request that you should atleast interview the persons who all are fulfilling the eligibility criteria for the position and applying for these positions because interviewing you can't judge a person weather he/she is eligibile for the job.

"I received an acknowledgement that the application was received. However if not shortlisted, a courteous notification of that fact would be a reasonable expectation. In addition to that, the person referred to in the ad Virginia Tam was very unhelpful. Because I had not heard anything, I rang on the number provided on several occasions. My phone messages were never answered and on the one occasion I actually got through to that person, she was rude and dismissive. That made me wonder whether her attitude was representative of the culture of the company and if so, whether Johnson & Johnson is a company I would like to be associated with.
"
I received a phone call from the recruiter but couldn't take it as I was in a meeting. I returned the phone call as soon as I could and left a message on the persons mobile and landline on Friday and Monday but they still haven't returned my phone call. 
I recall the software part of the application was quite clunky and repetitive. My perception. Perhaps someone from JnJ should use it as a candidate the issues may repeat themselves. Thx for the opportunity to feedback.
"I really wanted to have an interview, but I guess I was not picked. 
Well I still wish me and Johnson and Johnson the best blessing. :) "
"i really really love the job, so thanks for Johnson & Johnson provide a offer to me. 

i will try my best for my daily working life, and make the success with company"
"I really do not know how the HR department handles each application, but if possible, I hope for the process to be a bit faster. Nevertheless, I may be mistaken and the long process is really due to the department carefully reviewing each applicant's merit. "
I prefer to have an online examination/ ability test to further know the applicant
"I prefer clear rejection to my application being kept ""under review"" forever. Clear rejection helps candidates to move on to other application processes instead of keeping them in limbo, moreover, it gives a positive image of the company. One wonders what kind of work culture such a company might have - and what kind of people work in the recruiting department - that doesn't even extend this simple courtesy to unwanted candidates.

One more remark about the file upload procedure: it was not indicated clearly prior to uploading the CV exactly what/how many files would be required, and that the upload could be modified later on, e.g. additional files could be provided. This makes the upload process rather unintuitive."
"I personally think that yours are good enough but in order to have a better one, please give feedback to applicants within 2 or 3 weeks but not letting them wait for too long."
I only have experienced the application online process and I think the platform is already good and very convenient to use.
"I noticed that there are several vacancies for position that (almost) require the same skills set. I hope that candidates will be considered for all these positions and not just the one that they applied to. Or, possibly, an option to include if candidate is interested to apply for another position. "
"I noticed that the qualifications section of the role of Manager, Consumer Innovation and Experience was a repeat of the ""Responsibilities"" section, so it would be great if it could updated so candidates would have a better idea. Overall, I felt that the online application process was simple and fuss free, something that I greatly appreciate. Thank you! "
"I noticed that the IT design for the information required to be provided by applicants through the online system may have problems and the systime is quite rigid. For example, the system automatically summarized my working experience and education history. But some of the datas summarized were not correct. I tried to edit and correct them, some of the results were still wrong. I tried several times. Unfortunately, the online webpage for the application were still the same. Hope this can be improved in future.          "
"I normally get to know about J&J jobs through LinkedIn or career page of J&J. I am not too sure whether its available on other portals or not. In case its not, making it available on other popular portals like Naukri and IIMjobs which are quite popular in India will definitely help in increase the pool of candidates applying in J&J."
"I never knew about my application status which I find difficult to digest in case of a big Organization like J&J who are sending a feedback form for comments but don't bother answering the status of application.

I think in case of applicants which are not hired but showcase a strong profile they should be spoken about the gaps and whether they could be considered in the future in case they are improving certain skill.

I believe diversified people make organisations great and the company should sought out these profiles."
I never heard anything from my application
"I never got a survey from an employer to ask my views about them. I am pleased by the way you treat an applicant. 

I just wanted to suggest a bit clarity in job description. As the word ""account"" occupies a place in designation, It would be more clear if explanation can be given about accounts. "
"I need to know the result of the application process. If I am not qualified for this position, plesase let me know. Thank you"
"I need to go through entire recruitment process and then it would good to comment on overall experience of the recruitment process.
I am just going through Step 2 of the entire process."

I need a job for medical representatives and i love this company. .
I m very glad to know that johnson & johnson is asking for feedback before the interview procedure starts. Its a rare thing i have seen. Dont seem any major improve is required. Have a nice day. Thanks. 
I look forward to hear from you soon.
"I live in Taiwan and when I enter J&J recruitment website page, this is automatic reveal Simplified Chinese. It is not convenient to me and some jobs can not be searched. English is more suitable to job candidate."
I liked the application process. It was understandable and smooth. 
I like the process. No suggestions as of now
I learned about this opening from a friend only. I hope that I can also see the openings from Linkedin or other job hunting site.
"I learned a new opinion survey before interacting with any candidate and its very good to save management time as well valuable resources within the competency check of any candidate. 
Thanks for the opportunity."
"I know the person who is interviewing me in busy, but then so am I. And hence a pre-agreed time is set for the interview.

The person may get delayed, I agree but it is expected courtesy from a reputed company like J&J that I get a call on the delay, instead of me chasing for an update."
"I know that Johnson & Johnson is a big organisation and is strict on their recruitment and selection process. However, I always believe in an opportunity given to people. Such people might not be a right match in terms an knowledge and experience but definitely have a good attitude which will still prove to be a good fit. For your thought."
"I know Johnson & Johnson company, very scientific related,  Once I getting Oppurnity I can much better result. I waiting for this Oppurnity in organization."
I just hope that there are more opportunities.
I just hope that J&J can keep an open mind when recruiting as other industries guys might be able to bring new ideas and concept into the current pool of talent  
"I just got this mail , First provide if am selected or not "
"I just can find Job posting few site.
Need to Job posting a lot of site."
I jave several applications sent bit never received a call from anyone. 
I hope you give me a chance to work for your company.
"I hope the job description would become more specific.
Apart from that, your recruitment process is the most simple, time-effective and convenient that I have ever experienced.
Appreciate for your invitation to this survey!"
I hope the caller can be more precise in what they want to ask. The call I got kind of ended abrutly near the last part of the conversation. No news after that. I still thought I stand a chance to get the job as I know the processes for part of the job scope. Probably an email will be good too.
I hope that you can update the candidates if they are not a good fit or if you've already selected others. :)
I hope that someone from the Talent Acquisition Team will reach out and just check the applicants from time to time in that way applicants will know that they are taking care of.
"I hope that Johnson & Johnson will be able to test the candidate's desire for a job more intuitively in the recruitment process, because I am confident that I am sure to get the best rating in this test. At the end of the network Q & A can increase the number of candidates to show their own advantages. For example, I am hardworking, willing to learn non-stop; have a certain language and writing skills; organized and coordinated experience. In the university many times to participate in the organization level, hospital level activities and so on. At the same time, I would like to be notified as soon as possible because I really can not wait to join Johnson & Johnson. Finally, wish Johnson & Johnson in China can be better and better."
"I hope that in the process of recruitment, Johnson & Johnson not only get the best candidates both academically but also someone who has a strong character and passion for the company to work wholeheartedly. Not because of money alone. Thank you so much."
I hope that i receive updates on how i fared in my application. Status be it negative or positive update is highly valuable so that i can better understand what is lacking in my application or my capabilities and knowledge so that i can further develop it.
I hope that I am able to know the process my application is going on. 
"I hope that each applicant will receive an interview call. At minimum, a phone chat will be a good start to assess the candidate profile

Not just limited to reviewing of CV"
I hope that applicants can get a feedback within a week.
I hope Johnson&Johnson can be more quick and responsive in their recruitment process. I'd be really thankful and appreciate it if Johnson&Johnson can give a clear answer regarding the candidate's status in the process (fail or proceed) as the candidates are also looking forward to certainty and assurance
"I Hope johnson & johnson can post complete job vacancy not only on johnson & johnson's website, e.g. in www.jobstreet.com and others. because not all people know your company website.

I hope it can be more well informed

"I hope in the future when someone send the application, johnson & johnson can send the person confirmation e-mail that the application has been received. i hope Johnson & Johnson can also participated in job fair. thank you"
"I hope I could follow the recruitment process first, so I'll give suggestion about the improvement :)"
I hope current process is fair enough 
I highly suggest you give an immediate update on the status of all applications.
I highly appreciate the application process provided by the company as it was easy and includes the detail description of an candidature. The only suggestion is to  include the use of online video interviews facilities for the selected appicants.
"I havent been through the entire process yet; however, the initial application process was fastastic. JnJ can differentiate (for better) itself from other companies using the Taleo platform by proving a swift and personalized reply. A rapid response, even if its negative, can help the candidates to re-strategize quickly."
"I havent attended the interview, too early for any suggestions."
I haven't received any notification of my application result for Marketing Assistant position in Vietnam (1700159382W). I hope to receive any feedback form Talent Acquisition Team.
I haven't received any email from your company whether my CV has been selected or rejected. Please revert.
I haven't received any calls in regards to the interview process. A call would mean that the company is taking step further to help the candidate .
I haven't receive any update on my application up to now. It would have been better if feedback or update on the application status is provided by recruitment team to expecting applicants like me. This can be a significant improvement in the process of recruitment and can be both beneficial to the company reputation and applicants. 
"I haven't heard yet from J & J yet and it is almost a month now. My sincere request to all companies who place job ads, please do not take the interested candidates for a ride. After applying we wait to hear back from you and you guys never ever turn up. Be it negative or positive, candidates would be happy to hear from the recruiter. I have hardly seen this level of professionalism in any company."
"I haven't heard from your Philippine Representative office from the time I have considered the post. However, I will gladly wait to receive a call from my landline @ +6325623639/or my preferred mobile +6329993372151.

I haven't heard from HR  from the time I submitted. No email or call for further processing of my resume. 
I haven't heard anything of my result.
I haven't heard anything from any of your recruitment officers yet. I would love to go through the application process with J&J. This is a company that I have been wanting to penetrate for so long. I believe in its vision and mission and I wanted to be a part of great organization like this.
"I haven't gone through whole process but, till this survey it seems very good."
I haven't found any improvement as per i go through current process. 
"I haven't experienced yet how does the recruitment process of J&J since I did not received feedback as of now regarding my application, so I cannot suggest any. I have knowledge with J&J since I was once an analyst of a BPO who catered services (Intercompany) to J&J."
I haven't experienced the whole process yet to be able to answer this question.
"I haven't been through the whole process yet, but so far it is great."
"I haven't been reached out as such by the HR for the roles i had applied. So not sure at this moment about the overall experience as a candidate. 

But as far as application process is concerned. It was pretty easy."
I have. applied for two roles in the past 2-3 months and had some technical issues during the process. In both cases I contacted the Talent Acquisition contact listed but to date I have had no response from either. I have not had any further communication in relation to either of these roles.
"I have still to hear back about the application so the feedback to interview or rejection is slow.
This survey was sent a week after application. While searching for job opportunities, I apply through different sites to different positions, so I cannot recall what the application process was like for Johnson and Johnson."
I have stadied GMP
"I have recently submitted my first application through company website. I have not had any difficulties while making the application. The acknowledgement was received promptly along with the survey request which is recognized as a unique effort by Johnson & Johnson. 

The only possible recommendation from the candidate perspective would be ability to personally connect with the recruiter.

I have received the survey but no one has come back on the status of my application
"I have received no feedback on my application, except for this survey."
I have received mo call from your recruitment team and it is been ages i have applied for this position. Please improve your hiring stamdards
"I have only submitted my application now but it was simple, easy and very intuitive. At this stage I cannot think of anything that could be done to improve the process."
"I have only gone through the application system thus far, which means the surface of the entire process, and hence I may not the right person to provide valuable inputs towards improvement of the process. Thank you for asking anyway.."
I have only completed the initial online application at this stage and I thought it was very clear and straight forward. A very standard online application. I look forward to seeing how they continue to conduct their recruitment preocesses. 
I have not yet received notification from Johnson and Johsnon regarding the status of my application and feel it's a bit premature to provide any comments at this stage 
"I have not yet heard back from j&j regarding my application, so communication , whether you progress or not, could be majorly improved "
I have not received any call from the HR Team would like them to call for an interview that is why I applied considering my experience and skill set being apt for the role
"I have not received an any updates regarding the further steps for this application.

Generally What I have found that only in European Countries Application Via website (JOB portal) is considered for further steps. In India Companies only post the JOb openings just for the name sake they still consider only their referrals and applications from Job consultants.

I have a same experience with Johnson and Johnson as well, I hope companies should have more eye on the applications received via Job Portal as well. "
I have not received a reply on the status of my application.  It would be great if the candidate gets at least a reply (even if it was a rejection).  Thank you!
I have not interviewed yet for the position that i have applied for and im not sure of the status as i didnt get any feedback whether my application is rejected or will move on to the next phase.
I have not heard back from J&J after my first round interview. I would suggest that if you take the time to interview candidates you also have the courtesy to inform them of the outcome. 
I have not heard anything back from them after i sent in my application. I do hope an email would be good.
"I have not heard any feedback for this application, it would be nice if the company can give me an follow up or update for this position. 
I do feel it is a perfect match with my background and experience, and hope to have an opportunity to talk with hiring manager regarding my qualification for this position

I have not had any feedback from J&J HR on if my application was sucessful or not.

I have not gone through the process. i may not give this  answer.

"I have no further request regarding recruitment process. I strongly satisfied. Interviewer showed me a clear vision of my career path and I also shared my plan. Interviewer had an open mind, so we could discussed in detail. This process gave me a clear image that I work for Johnson and Johnson group."
I have no experience in recruitment process so no advice

i have lots of things to batter apply for Johnson & Jonson but i know that is the good company all over are the world and management team is very educated persons to improve day by day.
I have just gone through the initial application phase so would not like to comment at this time point.  
I HAVE IMPRESSED FROM  Johnson & Johnson recruitment process RECRUITMENT FROM THERE WEBSITE
I have had no update on my application since applying so this survey is a little premature in my case. I will be contacting Virginia directly today to see if I can get an update. Thanks Jess

"i have found the recruitment process good because it directly mentions the requirement, the no. of posts available. One is clear in the mind that this is the job one is going to do."
"I have enjoyed the process online however, I feel that it would be great if talent acquisition team can get back within 2 weeks of application. Understanding the amount of applicants are likely to be overwhelming and this might not be possible."
"I have been doing my career change only for two weeks.
I only had an interview with Johnson & Johnson.
Therefore, I do not know the improvement point."
"I have applied. However haven't heard anything after that. Directly received this link to share my feedback.

Please let me know what happened to my application.. Thank you

"I have applied to so many supply chain / logistics / SAP IT related positions in JnJ within the last 1 year, but most of the applications were rejected by sending an automated rejection email by the HR system, this procedure need to be abandoned as it reduces the chances of selecting potentially skilled and experienced future employees. I strongly believe JnJ is an equal opportunity employer without considering a person's race, religion, ethnicity or age group. Also need to give more preference to online applications rather than entertaining job agents by HR partners in the selection process. The hiring line managers must go thru all the potential applications to see the candidates experience and functional knowledge rather than the HR person makes an initial selection process. I have an MBA (from SUNY Buffalo), an Engineering degree, SAP and supply chain certification trainings, completed lean six sigma and project management trainings, but my applications are getting rejected by JnJ HR system, this is really disappointing especially from a global MNC like JnJ! Why not give me a chance to have a face to face interview with the hiring line manager and find out my capability? Hope the HR Senior Management will look into it and correct the practices. Thank you"
"I have applied several times to lot many openings. But I have never received any calls from the company HR or Talent Acquisition team. May be my candidature is not suitable but still if some feedback is provided it will be really helpful and motivating to keep the dreams alive to work for such a prestigious global brand.
Its not possible to send individual feedback to all applicants but still if some questionnaire is floated in the portal then things can work competitively from both recruiter's & J&J aspirants ends. 
Thanks & regards."
I have applied many times through carrier website but I didn't receive a single confirmation
I have applied for the position of Senior Business Analyst – Business Insights. But somehow I am not able to view the submission status.It would be really great if you can add this feature in your career section. 
"I have applied for the position of Contact Center Team Lead on the 27th February 2017.

I wait in anticipation as to whether or not i could be part of the company.

Johnson & Johnson could probably let the candidate know if they are being considered for the job rather than being asked for a Talent Acquisition Online Survey. 

"
I have applied for several positions with JnJ in Singapore and other countries for the supply chain / logistics / projects related positions. However I am repeatedly getting automated messages stating that my application is not successful each time! Why cant the hiring team call the candidates with right profile and experience for an interview and find out what they can deliver or find out directly on their capabilities? I am a qualified supply chain / SAP / logistics professional with 16+ years of experience and holds an MBA & Engineering degrees.I am still waiting for an interview with the direct hiring line manager after sending more than 30 applications to JnJ for the last 1 year. It looks like the direct applicants via JnJ career website is not getting interview calls when compared with candidates applying thru the career agents!
"I have applied for few roles at Johnson & Johnson, However I have not heard anything back. If response time on the application is shortened then I can focus on applying at other companies. 
Also, I am not sure if the profile is mismatch or the location / job permit is an issue for the role. Such clarification will help in considering future roles with Johnson & Johnson. "
"I have applied for few roles at jnj but no luck yet. Besides application and getting back few rejection mails, I haven't got into or experienced the recruitment process to actually advice on.

I have worked with an international conglomerate handling niche recruitments,  business partnering and more. According to me, recruiters are face of the company, hiring best talent from the market is itself a talent.

Sometimes CVs don't speak everything, even at the 1st step of screening and there could be many reasons to it. Sometimes even a short phone call or a short interview meeting with the candidate could turn a win win of hiring best talent for the company.

A recruiters feedback, how they speak, what they speak to a candidate while giving a feedback of rejection, actually counts a lot for the brand/organization. 

Recruiters and Recruitment process is a  gateway for candidates to enter a company but it also depends on the candidate's experience of going through a type of recruitment process at a company.

There are many ideas,  to improve a recruitment process or improve candidate experience.

"I have applied few of roles with your company, I heard nothing from your HR but keep getting this survey reminder. I have taken the risk to open this link as this email does look like spam email which very much discouraged me to not click on the link.  Also would be nice to be advised that you will send the survey if I applied the job.  Lydia Henstock "
"I have applied few jobs with J&J,
I don't think you guys even look at candidate profiles,
Simply sending your application is rejected email is not an answer for some one and I truly believe it is a discriminating company where Race is a major factor.
Now this email will be deleted with out addressing the issue,then what is the point on taking a survey.
In future I will never apply for jobs with J&J and I don't encourage others to do it.
Thanks.

I have applied but never got an opportunity to prove myself.
"I have actually been offered an executive secretary position with Johnson & Johnson to start in August 2014 which i TURNED down because my current project at that time was extended for another year and a half. However, due to an abrupt change management, my contract was shortened to few months. it was really a huge blow for me ! 

I am very confident that I fit into any environment because I am versatile with the demands of the ever changing business requirements. Open to learn new skills and responsibilities. 

I am currently taking a course in Leadership and service excellence with Kaplan at Devan Nair Institute. I've completed two modules in HRD and HRM which I will plan to continue to earn a Professional Diploma in Human Resources Development and Management. These two courses are very useful in my daily duties and communications with my team of 200 people for the Maersk Oil UK project in the North Sea. 

I strongly feel that Johnson & Johnson did a great job in selecting their candidates for all the positions that they hire. Perhaps what you can do as an organisation are :

1. have a telephone interview or Skype interview before inviting applicants for a second interview at J&J office. This would probably save some time or a bit of time for both parties as this interview can be conducted anywhere. I was involved in this type of interviews especially when the interviewers are travelling, hasn't secured an office in Singapore at that time or, due to time difference. With everyone owning at least one mobile phone, this is a piece of cake ! 

2. Inform applicants if they are selected and that they will be expecting an email or a call from Johnson & Johnson or their agency personnel,whichever has been arranged at a certain allocated schedule.

3. Inform applicants when they are NOT selected for ""this position"" as soon as possible instead of informing them much later.  Applicants need to know if they have the potential otherwise, they would like to move on to other opportunities. Applicants are usually hungry for information in this fast paced technological environment which can be done using customised SAP software if deems necessary. 

I hope the above may help Johnson & Johnson to improve the recruitment process. It seems too much work initially but, in the long run, both parties will be benefit - time, money & resources. This is also to AVOID receiving unnecessary emails and calls, asking for the status of applicants' application and to set Johnson & Johnson apart and ahead from the rest of the other companies. 

Kind regards,
Ummi Ramli"

"I havd still not heard back from J&J from my application for the role,  I did receive an acknowledgementment that my application was received, but nothing more beyond that. I have re-issued my application incase the first was lost.  It would be good to understand where in the recruitment process J&J are at and how my application is or is not progressing in that process.  I believed I was the perfect candidate for the advertised J&J vacant role in terms of culture fit, experience, skills and capability."
I had to upload my file twice because it failed the first time; the website misread my file size
I had problem uploading my resume. 
"I had not applied for a job for many years. 
I completed a cover letter, which I did upload, but it was not clear to me if this was required.

I applied for the position approximately 3 weeks ago. I see that the application is still open. It would be helpful to know what kind of time frame to expect, even if it is to inform me that I have not been successful.

"I had a horrible interview experience and saw the true colors of the business.

I will not be looking at any future positions with j&j.

To improve i would suggest talking to your interviewees if there are any concerns and disscussing the concern so the interviewee has a chance to explain.

What i experienced was assumtions, condesention, judgement, a lack of understanding and a work ethic that did not match the company credo.

"I had a hard time with the user ID and password given to me.  I had to contact one of J&J's employees who referred me to raise the said issue.  Other than that , I am looking forward to exploring opportunities with J&J.

thank you!"
I guess I would like the employers let the candidates know whether they are eligible or being considered into the interviews.
"I guess faster processing of applications would help, but of course without jeopardizing the quality of the applicants picked for the job."
I guess doing good enough.
I got rejection on a very second day ...giving a very generic reason which most of the companies give when position is already filled!!!  I would atleast expect a valid reason for rejection when I knew I even fulfilled the criteria  of working in similar range of products. Reject me for a valid reason !!! 
"I found the process thus far relaxing and informative.
I feel the process is great and would not change any part.

I found the process for recruitment primarily by assessing good.But telephonic or any  one to one conversation  gives more fairer picture or idea about both the persons as views can be exchanged and new features can be explored which is a slight constraint in  survey assessment..
I found it unique already by set of questions in questionnaire
"I found it quite smooth, and the questions asked were quite appropriate. It was a decent experience."
"i found every thing perfect so do not required any changes right now . 
."
"I found 2 websites link to the carreer.
It seems, to apply a job go to this site but to follow up the progress, go to another site.
This make some confuse at the beginning.
"
"I followed up with HR on my candidature status after interview and I did not get any response despite many messages. A 'Yes' or a 'No' could have sufficed. This is really rude. You need to understand that I gave my valuable time to the interviewer and hence a minimum courtesy of a response is expected.

I don't know whether this will be read and actioned upon but I will never ever apply to J&J now. Thanks

I fit very well into the roles that I applied to but was instantly rejected.  I would have atleast liked a recruiter to give me a call.  
I find this as a very user friendly selection procedure but still there are people as a hidden talent in the market so any how if they get to know about the openings through any means then definitely you would also have a a adventurous time in selecting people.
"I find the recruitment process satisfactory. Though, it might be helpful if you can speed up the response of the application. Overall, I'm satisfied with it."
"I find the recruitment process is effective enough and I would suggest the recruiter can assist the contract staff on how to apply job in J & J. Since the workday is only applicalble for permanent staff, thus J & J can give suggestions to contract staff on the applicaton process."
I find the process alright
"I felt comfortable through out the application process. So far so good.

"I feel your current recruitment process is in right track, so you can go ahead with the same rather changing or improving it."
"I feel you discriminate against American workers. You hire people in the U.S. from every country but when I apply for a job in Europe my resume gets re-routed to the garbage. I don't think you even read my resume, because if you did, you would realize that I am very qualified for the job and yet, consistently rejected. I feel your recruiters don't use your own candidate profile system to look for candidates. One has to apply over and over again.  I feel you only hire MBA's. You overlook qualified candidates. "
"I feel this process is okay, infact i didn't think about reply from J&J like other places, atleast there is satisfication that my application is noticed.
Thank you very much."
I feel that the recruitment process is very structured since I have already been through this process during my internship.  
I feel that the process took a little longer than expected .
"I feel rather than insisting on premium B school degree, JnJ should be open to look for passionate candidates from industry and tier 2 colleges"
I feel it is best process & hoping to have an interview opportunity for the vacancies.

I failed to upload my cover letter thousand times. That's why i picked No option. /sad
"I emailed about something to be improved as follows and didn't hear anything back.

Dear J&J talent acquisition team.
I just want to let you know that there seem to be some errors in your automatic email system.

I got 2 emails this morning, one to confirm that I’ve been hired, and the other is below email that I’ve withdrawn my application which is not true.
From previous communication with HR and my hiring manager, I was aware that I got the position, so for me the system error was not an issue.
But if there have been no communications before, I would have been very confused to receive 2 emails with conflicting results.

One more thing is that these emails were sent out to me a week after I signed the offer from the HR.

Best Regards,
Young

"I dont know why I keep getting the survey link,last time I applied was months ago and unfortunately Johnson & Johnson couldnt help me with tier 2 general visa sponsorship,please stop sending me the link for survey,its been months,unless things change in regards to the ability of Johnson & Johnson to provide sponsorship,I am currently not interested to be filling surveys for job recruitment I didnt get to experience a lot, thank you, have a nice day"
"I dont know overall recruitment process, but johnson & johnson need to always evaluate with the people has recruited in johnson & johnson. We can monitoring the people in the training period. If the majority of the people as good as you want, the recruitment process is done well. But if the majority of the people not what johnson & johnson want, there must be something wrong in the recruitment process. Maybe, we can add presentation process, video process, or something like that, depend on what johnson & johnson need."
I dont know because I am never recruitment process at Johnson & Johnson
I dont know about the process of the company but 1st process is to take telephonic interview of candidate. And then further process well be continue.
"I don't yet know the outcome of my application. Given the invitation to complete the survey, I suspect that my application has been rejected and I simply don't know it. If this is correct you might want to review your process. If, by contrast, my application has not been rejected then perhaps the timing of this survey should be delayed until a later point so as to obtain more complete and representative results. "
I don't see any progress yet.
I don't recall if there was a Posted date for this ad but an Closing Date for applicants would be helpful.    Sometimes job postings expire and yet will reappear in Linked In/Glassdoor.   Dates will be helpful.
"I don't need to tell you what to do to improve the recruitment process, if you recruit me, you know what to do and you're doing it!"
"I don't look forward to add anything to the process that is being followed by J&J because it's transparent, interactive and the most important is that a candidate is updated with any kind of development on his / her job application."
"I don't know why I am participating in the survey cause
I am not an employee of this company 
Even recently I had not been recruited 
Yes I have uploaded the application but I did not get any intimation for interview

I don't know the current recruitment process very well. As of now no comments
"I don't know how recruitment process on Johnson & Johnson takes much times, but hopefully i hope in every single step on recruitment would be nice to give status info to candidate so they can know how long, next step and so on. Thanks :)   "
"I don't have major suggestions but yes, i would suggest an early review of applications and earliest interview calls. 

Moreover, there must be a provision of skype interviews (may be preliminary interviews) for outstation candidates."
"I don't have a experience of Johnson and Johnson recruitment process but in pharma sector their is certain round of interview even some company will done interview through Vc.
"
I don't find any good remarks as of now to improve the recruitment process.  
I don't believe I was ever contacted about tlmy application. I'm not even sure if it's still active or not...
I do not think of any so far.
I do not think I have received a reply about my application.
i do not see any problem or concern with the way J&J is doing its recruitment process.
I do not know about my application. I think you need to inform us about the process.
I do not have any comments for now
"I do not have any comment at the moment, but so far things are done electronically pretty well. Thanks. "
"I didn't undergone through current recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson,so no suggestion."
I didn't received the result for C.V.review yet. I hope to receive the results although this was not good.
"I did not recoeve any response from JnJ yet to my application. 
Maybe a reduction in response time would be better. 
"
I did not receive any feedback hence I wish I had no or yes prior to this survey.  
"I did not receive any contact but this survey, "
"I did not receive a status update on my application.Instead, I received a request for process feedback. Maybe, the sequence could be changed. Feedback given first and then elicited."
"I did not have any response to my application at all.
The fact that I have been asked to participate in this survey is my first contact since applying, which I think is poor. "
I couldnot say much for the process for I only (until now) send my Application letter. But through reading notes or reviews of other applicants I found that the recruitment process in Johnson and Johnson is excellent. Hope your company always continue  the process. Success for Johnson and Johnson.
"I consider the recruitment process is strongly established well. Therefore, I couldn't comment to the processes itself.

Job description is sometimes static, I heard there are dynamic chances in Johnson & Johnson in the past interviews. Therefore, if the dynamism of Job at Johnson & Johnson are described in more detail as one idea, it helps me. E.g. future career path, project opportunities, exciting environment and so on. Anyway, I could hear about job in detail from agents or interviewer.
"
I consider that recruitment process should be an exploring process. The process where candidate should be provided with a real time  situation to resolve out with better options. Because this help recruiter to have clear ideas about how smartly candidate use his/her knowledge along with his/her instincts. 
"I completed the application, a month ago, and other than being asked to complete this form I haven't received any feedback.

Compared to some of your competitors the forms for an initial application is quite long. 

That said the process was intuitive and straight forward.

Thank you,

Harry"
I can’t suggest at this stage. I am not fully aware about present process. 
I cannot think of anything more you could do.
"I cannot see the progress of my application. Probably it can provide the status, such as CV reviewed, Fit or not Fit for the posibition etc.,"
"I cannot find the ""Choith Management Consulting (Shanghai) Co., Ltd."" which referred me in the "" Agency Select"". Hope the database can be updated frequently."
"I cannot comment more than the above as I was not granted an opportunity to a phone interview as mentioned over the phone. Supposed, they are many more better candidates than me. However, based on the initial call, the intent and approach were very professional and it left me a deep impression that the HR is on the ball. Nevertheless, I will continue to try and pursue when the next opportunity arises.

"I cannot answer this question in a simple fashion until I get more details of your entire recruitment process. However, as far as I can up to now and in light of the way I applied to your company, I do not see any clear shortcoming, seemingly whatsoever, in your recruitment process at this juncture.  It appears to me that your HR recruitment process well fits to your credo and your global system operation for effective HR innovation as well as your leadership in the industry.

Many thanks.."
I can't really say much as I haven't been interviewed yet none from JnJ called me so far
"I can't really comment on the recruitment process as I was never contacted, there wasn't a process. 

It would have been nice to hear that I wasn't successful and why as opposed to receiving numerous emails asking for my opinion on a process I wasn't a part of. 

Thank you. "
I can't provide any extensive feedback since I haven't undergone any interview much less has been contacted by your recruitment team.  But your recruitment website does gain attention for anybody browsing for job postings. 
"I can't explain about this.

Thanking You."
"I can think only one now, and that ill be to speed up the process."
I can retail base and business increase
"I can not do much comment now since I don't see yet the full recruitment process at this moment.
But for the application process, is quite well done.

thanks"
I can imagine several applications come in as a part of online job application process. However I expect a better follow up process specially for senior positions like the one applied.
I can give feedback post to my evaluation.
"I can assure you that if I am selected, I shall work with great dedication and to the best of my abilities & experience."
I can answer once I will go through complete process
I believe to improve every company hiring process including your firm that you must have to make being responsive to candidates as a priority. To the point about letting the candidate know if they succeed or not. To be successful is great but not knowing is very frustrating.
"I believe there is always a scope for improvement but surveys should be done with candidates whose CVs are shortlisted and not to anyone who has applied. A candidate who has applied would have considered this opportunity progression for the current role and all those factors mentioned in the first question. Shortlisted candidates will at least be able to contribute to the experience they had with the company through the recruitment process. 
The above feedback is a candidate's opinion and I am not an HR expert.
Thank you. "
I believe the turnaround time should be reduced. There were instances in which I was never informed about what is going on particular position applied for.
"I believe the requirements for the job profile should be more precise, just not restricted to educational qualifications, the kind of experience and expectations the candidate is expected to possess as such. "
I believe the recruitment process is good and they really screen applicants. I am just waiting for feedback on my application. thanks.
I believe the process is intuitive enough to go through and the user experience helps as a major complement to the application.
"I believe the process is excellent. The current process hinders favor of any internal reference and will allow the application process direct.

Thanks,
Hemant"
I believe the existing recruitment process is quite straightforward and simple.  The online application was intuitive and can easily be answered.
"I believe the entire process of recruitment should set a timeframe like for example a month or two (2),  so that applicants would know the status of their application.  I understand that big companies require time compare to those SMEs, but there's always a room for improvement.  Minimal as it may seem but for those applicants, it means a lot.    Keep up the good work and all the best."
I believe the current process of recruitment is very efficient. Thank you for the opportunity.
I believe the current process is well designed and it's great 
"I believe that you could improve on advertising the program more by posting on different sites like jobstreet, kalibr, and the likes"
"I believe that recruitment process could be a little more efficient in this case:
	. Contractors – As contractors are indirectly employees of JnJ, it would be interesting if it was possible to direct take participation in the talent discovery program which could bring good talents to JnJ family.
"
I believe that Johnson & Johnson has already have a very good recruitment process and I understand if the processing needs lot of time since the company has to consider a lot of factors choosing the right candidate for the job. If there would be a chance that an initial phone call or an email could be received by the applicant to let them know that J&J is still considering them would be very much appreciated.
"I believe that it would be of great help if you could meet  the  applicant  face to face to know them better, know their values,principles in life also their capabilities in the job. Upon doing this, you can at least have an idea if the applicant can be an asset to Johnson & Johnson. Moreover,on the part of the applicant, it feels good if you will be sincerely honest and inform them right away if they passed or failed to meet your  requirements and let them know that they can still try their luck on some other time. "
"I believe that everyone have their own talent regarding their age nor experience and if possible in the nearest future it would be wise to pick employees whom are passionate regarding the above statement i stated previously eventhough the salalry wuld be high in consideration. How am i to debate this issue in further, it would be wise for me to have it in person to person debate to attribute this issue to you. Thank you."
I believe providing the customized tailored feedback explaining the reason to the candidates on the outcome of the application is an important area which companies like Johnson & Johnson needs to improve as well. This can be achieve by taking technology help.This feedback mechanism will also help candidates to work on their weak areas and to compete in a more better way for the future openings.
"I believe Johnson and Johnson is a reputable company. Selecting the right candidate is very important. If possible to arrange the short listed candidates to come down for interview and to understand both parties (candidate and company) better. 

"
I believe johnson and johnson has a good recruitment process. 
"I believe Johnson & Johnson as one of the leading pharmaceuticals and healthcare companies, has an intensive recruitment process in order to hire the best candidate for a certain role. J&J has been doing really well in this, that I dont think it require any further improvement in terms of recruitment process at the moment. I have not undergone any interviews with J&J, so I cant comment further, apart from the application process. Thank you! Glad to be part of this survey."
I believe all factors were considered as part of the recruitment process
"I belief,  J $ J is a great organization for me to work for there. I am expressing my interest time and again.  If you pay attention to my work and learning given in resume,  it is not any average one. I have constantly delivered in high capacity under very demanding conditions.  I request someone to consider the facts there and give me opportunities for next stages. Regards Sanjay Pandey"
"I appreciate the survey being sent out, but I would appreciate more if I received an email notification regarding the status of my application instead."
"I applied via job agent, but no response yet. I'm waiting any reaction from your company."
I applied to the position almost a week ago and did not get any feedback. Shortening feedback times would contribute highly to the process.
"i applied the job on 5th Mar 2017, however i haven't got any updates yet until now (16th Mar). It will be much appreciated if the status of the application could be updated to candidates so that candidate knows where is the current stand.

thank you for your getting my feedback."
I applied for the role of Manager-Strategy and Market Development but I did not receive any communication from recruitment team. So I cannot really comment.
"I applied for the following job:
https://jobs.jnj.com/jobs/EV9/Assistant+Brand+Manager?lang=en-US

""Please note – this is not an advertisement for a current role with Johnson & Johnson Pacific. We are interested in hearing from marketing candidates who would like to work for Johnson & Johnson Pacific in the future, and would like to join our Talent Community.""
It would be nice if you could explain more in detail what will happen after the application."
I applied for multiple roles but did not receive any followup on status of my application. It will be very helpful if the company can send out email even if the applicant is not shortlisted for the next stage of process.
"I applied for a role but never heard back if I was successful or not, which is pretty poor. I also called your HR department to clarify how many hours the job was for (the ad only said part time), and they said they would call me back, however I never got a call back. To be honest my opinion of Johnson & Johnson has dropped considerably. "
I am yet to receive updates regarding the status of my applications.
I am yet to hear back from J&J in relation to my application other than an acknowledgement of receipt.
I am yet to complete an entire recruitment cycle with Johnson & Johnson.
i am waiting for recruitment at J & J since last 2 years
I am very looking forward to hearing back from Johnson & Johnson team regarding the decision!
I am very happy with the recruitment process. My only feedback is that the psychometric testing takes more than three hours to complete. It would have been nice to know that the process is closer to four hours including the practice quizzes. 
i am very great full to you Johnson & Johnson if you provide me any offer i am ready .i have experience inventory management. production transfer section head manager & computer hardware technician 
I am unable to comment on this as I am not aware of the recruitment process.
I am totally blank about recruitment process but one thing i can tell you .. taking survey is best thing to understand the candidates.
"I am sure you have a very good team working towards hiring the best candidates, who add to the value and reputation of the company. As a candidate willing to work with Johnson & Johnson with not much of exposure to the recruitment process at the organization, I don't think I am qualified enough at present, to give any suggestions on that regard."
I am sure this is the best format and procedure  of recruitment process. 
"I am sure J&J complying with one of the best hiring process in the industries. J&J can do some of the following to improve the recruitment process

1. Bring sales strategy into recruiting
2. Tap into, and use, the hiring manager social network more proactively
3. Have marketing assist in rewriting job descriptions to better sell the opportunity
4. Focus on passive candidate identification and relationship building — before you need to hire them
5. Ask hiring managers do participate in online virtual events to attract and engage passive talent.
6. Track and analyze data to provide talent insights to the business.
7. Have good market intelligence to change hiring manager behavior "

I am currently satisfied with the system but they can just be more clear about the job application whether it's open or closed. 
I am content with the present process
I am applying with J & J since last one year but there is no call or confirmation of interview from them. not able to understand what is the criteria of selection. 
"I am a reliable, responsible, trustworthy, tolerance and hardworking worker with good communication skills who works effectively in a team and have the ability to meet deadlines. I am keen to learn more knowledge out of my existing knowledge, thus,  I am looking for a new challenge where I can use my existing skills to further develop my career path. Besides, my strengths are I will not give up easily, have a good memory where I can memorize those things that I have learn before, therefore, the Company no need to worry about my learning process, so I am the best choice that the Company will be considered."
Humanize the experience to bond with J&J consumers more.  Recruitment should be viewed as an opportunity to strengthen the relationship with each person who applies in spite of the fact that all know only one will be successful it is an opportunity to further the brand and reputation of J&J with stakeholders.  
"HR/Talent Acquisition should make follow-ups to candidates regarding the status of their application. I was contacted for a phone interview and was asked if I am available for a personal interview the same date at night time. Was told that I will be contacted after a few hours to be advised about the exact time, where to go, and who to look for. I cancelled another appointment for that day so I can attend the interview they told. But no one contacted me back. A few days after I have to look-up for your HR's contact number. And when I was able to reach them, I was advised that the position was already filled. I checked your job portal, and there was a new posting for the same position."
"HR told  the headhunter that the job was out of the door,but that the result was an interview for HR?"
"HR should reply to the applicants once they have a decision, rather than not say anything to the applicants. This may lead people to feel disrepected.
"
"HR Recruiting is handling a lot of jobs posted, the feeling is that HR is not focusing enough for hiring position due to resource constraint"
HR process is too slow. Applicants are not contacted by HR for the application results which could mean successful or regretted.
Hr Philipine is professional more than HR VietNam. 
HR may contact the proper candidates directly via phone .
HR department should gives us a confirmation call regarding the job opening as mentioned in the mail.
"HR can provide candidates who have applied for the posted role of the application status to within a stipulated period of time so candidates can be more efficient with their job search.
"
How do I suggest take me in your organisation the i suggest. Because nothing is free.................
Hoping there will be email notifications on each step or progress of the application. Thank you.
"Hopefully, the respond will be fast on whether the candidate will be shortlist for interview and the final selection. "
hopefully every applicants who already sent it in order to receive the feedback upon their application continue or discontinue so the applicant didn't looking forward.
Hopefully a more prompt response to the application even if it is an unfavorable one.
Hope (Johnson & Johnson) they'll also reach out/contact those applicants with regards to their status on their application. 
"Honestly if I want to say, I would request please give more weightage to talent,hardwork and intent to work than experience.
If you don't allow the fresh air in system the growth will be stagnent.

Honestly i dont believe any change need to be made. Thank you..
Honestly I can not say for now but I believe notifying the job applicant after 2 weeks whether he / she is shortlisted would be a good way to let the applicant move on and possibly explain where he or she was lacking to improve in that area.

"Hi Recruiting Manager,

So far the Johnson & Johnson recruitment process has been unique, among all the companies that I had submitted job applications. Non so far care about the candidate experience which I think it is important. This Johnson & Johnson care sends out a positive signal and high-quality brand image to the candidates, whom they could be your future employee or potential customers. 

This positive thinking and direction matches well with my personal philosophy towards work attitude, relationship with people and crisis management. 

I believe that my work experience, skills and personality fits well to Johnson & Johnson corporate environment and I wish your management could consider my job application and grant me an interview to discuss your organisation’s top priority needs and the performance you can expect from me.

Hope to hear from you soon. B Rgds,

"Hi my name is yuni and my opinion is :
The recruitment process in J&J is good because every step in application online is detail but I think will be more better if the information about candidate who apply some position at J&J which pass or not the test can be faster like 1 or 2 weeks after their apply the position. "
"Hi Johnson & Johnson,

Thank you for giving this opportunity leave some suggestion.
I thought If set up a system which let candidate check where the recruitment process is, it could make candidate realize the situation , in the mean time, decrease the amount of phone call or E-mail from candidate to make it more efficient.

"Having and using solid data in your recruiting process requires gathering and analyzing the right measurements. Collect data on things like how long it takes to fill a job opening, how many candidates you source per hire, candidates interviewed per offer made, offer acceptance rates, and reasons offers are declined.  And candidate experience survey information provides valuable information about the status of your recruiting process and how to improve it."
"Having a SMS alert/notification apart from the emails can be a plus. As SMS can be checked on the go, without any internet connection. And that SMS can then help to redirect to the email or company website for more details."

Have a regional team for selection so that you will get the right candidate.

Giving opportunities for student who was graduated from less reputable universities or school but has strong desire and valuable skills offered.
Giving faster confirmation within days for all appliers in case he/she fit the qualification/competencies or not.  Do not hesitate to let them know as soon as possible.
Giving all candidate a letter in replay，whether they are successful or not.
"giving a candidate a little test maybe can improve the recruitment process. otherwise, johnson & johnson maybe will face a terrible process on selecting the right candidate. "
Give timely responses to candidates.

give notifications for people who don't pass the selection and give feedback for their improvement in the future once they selected or not 
"Give more people a chance and opportunity atleast till the interview stage so that an employee has a better chance of laying forward what he can/would do for the company and what is it that he can bring new to the table; rather than judging a candidate solely on the basis of his/her credit score or qualification. 

There are some companies that would rather hire a person who has a Masters in Economics to the analytical domain, and not a person who has a Bachelor's in Economics and has worked 1+ year in the analytical domain. 

This however should not be the case, especially if the latter possesses much more knowledge and hands on experience than the former (who incidentally has been dusting books all year). But this is the plight of the Indian market scenario at present and not much can be done about it."
Give more opportunities to candidates with more experience not just only in this industry but also their life experience as a whole as the maturity of the candidate will also plays as important part of portraying the positive company image and will help to boost the CSR to the society as a whole.
"Give more of advertisement about it as most of the people are unaware about it recruitment process,so that more people should come to participate init"
give more information about the specific requirements or make an online psychology test
Give more chances to the young generation and socially spread the information of vacancy on social sites to reach more candidates Within short time of period.And also make the recruitment process shorter but best in quality.

because my feeling is that I will become age old but without any big reference I will never be called for an interview also taking  job is out of scenario .Why you are taking this survey plz keep on placing your beatiful mails for talented fools like us who are applying and applying in jnj thinking that ...very fair I will be intwrviewedby jnj...but reality its reverse .Sorry if i had told you something strong which you don't like,I don't want to hurt.YOU ASK YOUR SOUL HR...you don't need to take surveys."

Get quick feedback on what step the applicant is currently in.
"Get in touch with candidates more quickly, and let candidates know where they are are the process advances.

It took over four weeks for J&J to get in contact with me after I applied for a position.

The hiring manager was also not very good at communicating during the hiring process what the next steps would be, or even when they would occur."
Get in touch with candidate via a phone call to follow the application 
Get in direct touch with the candidate for better understanding of the candidate's potentials
Get back with a quick response! thx fir the consideration
Get back to the candidate.
Get back to me regarding my application. I received an auto confirmation of my application being received but never heard back from the company after that
Get back to applicants faster.
"Generally speaking I am satisfied with the application process, but I reccommend to optimize the browser orchange a lcoal browser like Sougou as it often crashed that resulted in a series of troubles."
Generally satisfied with whole process of recruitment 
Further telephonic call may have better understanding and feeling of the employee employer relationship .
Furnish applicants with application status update.
"Functionally, the process worked and was smooth. If you need to improve, then it would be the look and feel. The buttons, the dropdown list etc look a bit squarish and lack of excitement. Very DOS looking vs Apple for example. "
"from what i experienced i found some technical difficulties while uploading the form,.may be some simplified procedures can help in improvising the ease of online application of recruitment."
"From my viewpoint, the current recrutment process were good enough."
"From my point of views and experience when applying for the position product manager, the recruitment process of J&J is clear - transparent, all the information I need is posted on the official website and job description. Therefore, I do not have ideas to improve the recruitment process so far."
"from my point of view, grades/administrative documents are not always the best ways to describe someone, though it would have significant role to know someone, there are much to come than just those stuffs, conducting some test to know the candidates even better would be a good idea :)"
"From my point of view when looking for job, all information provided and well guided in the process of applying for that particular job. Johnson & Johnson have one of the best recruitment system in place. "
"From my perspective, I acknowledge that the salary is negotiable and depend on the skills and experiences of the candidate. However, publishing an approximate salary that Johnson & Johnson is willing to pay can be a great plus for jobseekers."
"From my personnel experience, it's one of  the most plesent interview process, keep  up the good work."
"From my past experience in J&J Indonesia, hiring process from referral program took very short time and was simple. "
"From auto-email that confirmed J&J has received the application, may add the recruitment steps progress so that candidate will be able to understand where they are. For example; there are 5 steps: 1.Application receiving 2.Phone interview 3.Face-to-Face interview.. Thanks,"
"From a candidate point of view, I think the interview process was very beneficial as I got to understand more on the role through the detailed explanation from the hiring manager. However, it would be great if the candidate gets to visit the working area during the interview to get a feel of the future working environment."
"Frequent Mails regarding Vacancies to the registered candidates and provide the various opportunities for the freshers.
Thank you"
"Frankly i have just gone through this process via mails only. have not yet attended any personal interview and hence, based on my interaction through mail process, the process is very good. "
"For the role I'd applied, loan kit operator, I think you need to clearly specify the qualifications i.e. Certificates and requirements for the job. Based on the series of interviews I had, with my last interview with the TA coordinator, questions are somewhat for a higher position when in fact I was just applying for a loan kit operator. Anyway for justification purposes on my behalf, I answered the questions solely based on my personal experienced. Working in CSSD required us to process everything according to the accreditations we adhere.

Thank you JnJ for a good experienced. Hope to be given an opportunity to work in your company when another opportunity arise."
"For the part where we had to make a video of ourself (Introduction and why we are interested in the role, etc), it would be easier if J&J provided an official platform where we could record this video instead of just asking us to independently do it on any form of media, since that created issues while submitting the video."
"For the other position I applied for in J&J, I was given notice that my resume will not be considered further.  But for this position, I was not given any notice at all.

Therefore, I doubt the consistency of the process.

Thank you."
"For the online application, I couldn't seem to find out how to delete an uploaded resume. I ended up having two resumes uploaded and clicked on the one I wanted to use to proceed with the application. It will be great if replacing an uploaded resume function could be included. Thanks!"
"For the job posting including more than one position, it is recommended to provide a clear job description, role and duties or expectation for each position. This would accelerate the recruitment process and hire the right person."
"For the improvement of recruitment process  Johnson & Johnson should  verify the candidate's  past employer's feedback.
Johnson & Johnson should verify candidate knowledge related to competitor brands in the market and market demand."
For the first time I am answering survey like this for a role in a company very good initiative keep it up
For Taiwan it would be great to have information on whether Mandarin is required or only advantageous
"For Starters, most Multi National Companies, do not revert, with the status of opening. It would be great if a notification is received stating that the vacancy has been closed. Also, It would be fruitful, if a revert is made stating the sorting process for interview selection, and if a candidate does not go through, he / she should be informed of the same."
"For now, i have satisfied with J&J recruitment process, hopefully i can join as soon as possible and positively contributed to achieve corporate common goals."
"For more improve will be better if recruitment team also provide clear timeline for step by step process, so we also can have clear information about our process.
I also give highly appreciate for recruitment team that already provide clear step for me and ready to ask anytime for recruitment process."
"For me, i think there are so many questions in the application page. "
"For me, I think the recruitment process was organized, and effective. It was simple and asked necessary details. I think Johnson & Johnson can improve the recruitment process by providing a video or short stories/testimonials of people and their experiences with J&J. Nonetheless, the recruitment process was very good, and was able to capture necessary information needed from the applicant. "
"For me, a company can improve recruitment process by prioritizing to respond to candidates. It would be also helpful if companies will have initial interview in person. The good part about having personal interview is that you can receive their immediate response and decide candidate's qualification. "
For me the recruitment process of Johnson and Johnson has enough improvement. 
"For me the best candidate is not his education background, the best candidate for me is his attitude towards his work that is based on my experience."
For me it is well explained the job description.
For knowing the knowledge  of appointed employee
"For improving the recruitment process i would augest that the aplicant should get the internationally once the application request is taken or it is under process...
Overall its great..👍"
"For hiring a CA, more focus on technical knowledge & analytical capability rather than focusing on hiring a rank holder."

"For any organization, recruitment is a crucial part of developing and maintaining an effective and efficient team. A good recruitment strategy will cut down the wastage of time and money, .

"For all that experiences that i had, using variety method to apply the jobs, Johnson & Johnson provided the method above the standard (along with the notificatin sent through email) which i found it very usefull and helpfull. Best Regards Deity Kapoyos"
"Following are my suggestion for the improvement of the recruitment procedure, some of them are technically related to the functionality of the website, and some are related to hiring process:

1) The deadline for jobs is not clear, not sure how one can understand when the job is closing.

2) Based on one experience which I had there is no email update regarding the position which is being applied except the first email “submission received"" which is computer generated. Applicants would like to be informed even if they are rejected. Although I understand the immensity of the work required to respond to all, this can be automated, and computer generated.

3) Abbreviation in job advertisement can be avoided, this can minimize the confusion since the same abbreviation, and specific jargon ( without explanation) can mean something else in different setting and field. Each job description should be considered a unique entity. Therefore, all the components for understanding the role and the requirement should be included in the jobs.

4) It’s not clear if J & J would be supporting the applicants who are not the citizen or permeant residents of the country for which the job has been advertised. 

5) In the search function in J & J career website, I realised if you try to open the job description in the new tab you’ll get the same list of the original search. I think this need to be integrated into the system, meaning by clicking on the hyperlink on the job search either it should automatically open a new tab contain job description or it should open the desired page by clicking on the new tab. ( I try this function with Firefox and Safari, and none is working).

6) Some of the keywords are not uniform in the job descriptions, e.g., PhD and Ph.D.; someone looking for a job with PhD/Ph.D. 
if you search either of this you 'll get two different lists. I think this can be either uniform in the advertisement or integrated into the search engine to give the same result with either of the terms.

Thanks!"
"Following are a few suggestion -
1. Panel of experts ( Form Within Organisation & a few from outside) can be assigned for different domains / division/ departments. They will have active involvement while scrutinising all profiles. 

2.  This Pannel can be a mix of - few  youngsters and a few seasoned professionals.. Thus creating a bridgebetween old philosophy & young ideas , this would help preparing a perfect balance and platform for Organisation to adapt new philosophies and ideas while adherence to age old ethics and fundamentals.

3. Dynamic tests process to select right pool of talents. ( tests may not necessary be written test but can be of different types )


4. A website domain where candidates can get live updates on the status of their applications etc.

"Dear Sjoerd Gehring,

Thank you for giving this kind of question. Since it's my first time to have interaction with talent acquisition team of Johnson & Johnson, I could not say much. Regarding recruitment process, I wish I could be informed earlier before the interview timing or discuss about it at mutually convenient time. Therefore, I will prepare better and can get permission of taking days off from my current job.

Thank you again for your kind response. I wish successful future of Johnson and Johnson.

Yours sincerely,

"Dear Sirs,

I have applied for 4 potential roles I felt I could perform at J&J, since Dec and I got reply only on one recent application in which I was iformed I don't match requirements for the role. All other applied roles , no answer (hoping I'm still under consideration?). however the one I applied in December has 2-3 months and no answer at all. It would be good to at least know if I'm under consideration or not.
Your sincerely. Wilson Mizoguchi"
"Dear Sir/Mdm,

I've read great reviews on glassdoor for J&J, also heard good feedback about the company from people whom I know. The recruitment process is pretty good. A few areas if I may suggest for your due consideration in improvement: 1) Timeline indications (e.g. first round selection within 30 days), that would be more indicative for applicants. 2) In the current digital world, that could be some video record for 1-min self-introduction for applicants to opt for. 3) Past job applications, there seems no way to delete from record, maybe this can be looked into for applicant to choose to delete past applications in JnJ.  

Thank you and have a great week!

"Dear Sir/Madam,

From a job applicant's point of view, I think Johnson & Johnson's recruitment process is easy to use and a straight forward process.

In addition, I find this survey is a useful feedback tool to better understand the job applicants' views of Johnson & Johnson's brand as an employer. Use this wisely and it will enhance Johnson & Johnson as the employer of choice.

While I understand that this survey intends to be a quick and easy one for the job applicants, perhaps apart from just giving a score, it could be improved with additional open-ended questions (optional) by asking 'the reason(s) for their scores'. This will give not only quantitative feedback but also qualitative ones as well.

Thank you.

Yours faithfully,

I would like to suggest, provide a chance to the beginners. Some times even the experienced fail to do what a fresher or a new comer does. As a fresher I feel, they are enthusiastic, not stagnant and believe they can do stuffs much better than an experienced person. They just need the initial push through proper training and guidance. They are achievers then. This helps in maintaining the company level.

"Dear Sir,
At the very outset I  thank you for giving me an opportunity to provide feed-back for the TA process.  This process of seeking feedback from candidates itself is a big example of high standard of integrity and professionalism adhered to by J&J. I really appreciate the same. 

The whole process of Talent Acquisition was quick, flawless and transparent. 
 
 I have a small suggestion to make based on my experience ,as my candidature evaluation was entirely based on telephonic conversations from India and Belgium.
 I am of the view that face to face or video conference/ skype calls  is a  better method to conduct  interview if the interviewer and the candidates are from different continents having different phonetics.  I learnt this from my  experience of negotiating contracts with many western  clients and law firms in current job.

 I was not able to demonstrate my skills and competencies over telephone effectively due to lag in voice during call.  If this interview was on video conference or face to face, I am sure I would have  definitely grabbed this opportunity.  Hence  I requested for an appointment for  face to face meeting with the interviewer during my personal visit to Singapore.  However it was late …

I really appreciate you taking the time to consider me for the position and if any other vacancy were to become available, I would love to have the opportunity to apply.

Thanks again for your time. I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely

"Dear Madam / Sir,

I sincerely thank you for asking my opinion for improvement of recruitment process.

Please note to perform in any organisation, what matters is an experience, honesty, sincerity, hard & smart work.  Unfortunately in India what matters is a degree and not knowledge.  Since it has been asked by your good organisation, I would like to request you to give chance to a person by judging his capabilities and not only his degree. e.g. many times a graduate person also perform better than Chartered Accountant.  

I myself have worked with India's largest private sector Offshore organisation for 22 years and I have trained many C.A.'s and MBA's.  

Also please note when management has transferred me from accounts to operations dept.(it was requirement of operations dept. to have a very hard working person) our management has appointed 4 qualified CAs in my place and I have handed over my job profile to 4 qualified CAs. 

I, therefore, request you not to set any norms for a particular post. 

Thanking You,
Your's faithfully,

"Dear Johnson & Johnson,

Regarding to your business as FMCG company, the most important thing in your company is about ""communication"". Employees should have a good communication to external (suppliers and customers) and to internal (top and down). 
Therefore, my suggestions to improve on your recruitment process should have considered as follows:

1. Please do not refer to the marks as your first priority

2. The most important on the applicant is how they can improve their self at  Johnson & Johnson environment

3. To get that, you should tells applicant the true of Johnson & Johnson conditions and should have clear expectations from the applicant

4. You have to find the person who have the good communications. Because THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN COMPANY IS COMMUNICATIONS. AND THE PROBLEM IN COMMUNICATION IS PERSON LISTEN TO REPLY, NOT LISTEN TO UNDERSTAND.

Hopefully, all the points above can improve your recruitment to find the right applicant.

Sincerely,

"Considerations on employing a suitable staff: 
1. Be open-minded to hire people from different sectors, e.g. Public Sector. It is because this may bring new insights to the company. 

2. Willing to share vision in the interview. For example, how Janssen targets its strategy towards the market demand of the drugs (esp Chinese market).

3. Choose the right person based more on personal attributes (i.e. the one with good working attitude and has a ""Can-do"" attitude) rather than just with the right skills. 

4. As echoed with the job advertisement which has stated that ""alternative solutions"" are welcomed, the candidates with pioneering thoughts and could influence others should be considered first. 

Settings: 
1. Panel Interview would be better since there will be less bias in the result. Personal opinion is unavoidable and thus overall impression built by more than 1 or 2 persons is more appropriate. 

2. For Senior Level Staff, headhunters may be used. For Middle Level Staff, Glassdoor, Monster, Cpjobs, LinkedIn etc. could be used (just like the way they were used now). On the other hand, explore more channels e.g. built up an Apps for career searching at Johnson and Johnson. The Apps should store personal information with extra security control. 

3. Google search is also useful in knowing about the candidate as nowadays, much information about a person could be found on the internet.

"By the mid and late 2000’s, known as the starting era of digital marketing, online consumer relationship management has been practiced in various ways. It could be referred to as consumer marketing which is crucial for analyzing consumer needs such as consumer VOC analysis, membership level management, E-mail marketing as well as locating key targets.
However, companies nowadays tend to redirect from the previous policy by predicting the preliminary stages of data analysis and focus on proposing what the consumer wants. Latterly for the purpose of deriving consumer market insight, big data analytics have become fundamental for CDJ marketing process which takes consumers to enter and search for products into a search engine and make their way into purchasing the products.
Ahead of the curve of the marketing analysis, I have experienced through the projects which required collection and analysis of big data provided by Google and other various digital platforms, and proposed consumers with the right information and products.
Data marketing is essential in various steps of consumer insight analysis. Through the projects of Kia Motors and LG Electronics I have learnt what it takes to determine the targets’ needs and engage consumers with their opinions. As a result, I realized that the information marketers want to push to the consumers is different from the ones consumers actually want to receive at CDJ purchasing level. Moreover, data analysis has taught me that every product has a different thought process and search procedures. Thus, I experienced various ways to propose different methods of marketing based on analytic results.
My experience with Kia Motors’s Big Data marketing and Coca-Cola’s membership level point project taught me great tools I need for leading trends of the current market.
There are many corporations that specializes in Big Data analysis, yet extracting consumer insight to map with the results of the data analysis in order to draw marketing strategies is not a common experience to own. Therefore, I would like to offer your group my experience and abilities to create a mutual growth.

"Better feedback and confirmation of the application progress. We are reviewing, have reviewed etc... lack of feedback and updates is incredibly disappointing for any applicant. "
Better dissemination of the announcement in social media accounts.
Better communication. I have heard nothing in terms of the success of my application or whether it has been rejected
Better communication- the only communication from J&J  since applying for this role was this survey.
Better communication with the application process.
Better communication with applicants via phone call
Better Communication with applicant
"Better communication of the current job openings can be communicated through job portal, candidate mail I.D's. Need improvement in this."
Better Clarity.
Better advertising
"Best to have better reply rates, not just automated replies. "
"Best talents are not easily discovered through resumes and covered letters. I always believe track record alone does not truly define the synergies and attitude of the individual. Suggestion would be for recruitment process to be more interactive or activities based to discover the relevant traits that the company prefers. There is no updates to my job application yet, but I hope to join this great company. "
Best Process
"Besides giving an option to apply for a specific post, the recruitment section may facilitate the process of intimating the applicant for suitable jobs once they receive the details on their qualification and abilities in near future."
"beside the job vacancy from J&J website, it would be better if J&J also can put the job vacancy at job fair "
Being proactive to communicate with candidate on their progress of application.
"Being a pioneer company within its industry, they should reduce the time for scanning and recruitment process.Thanks"
"because J&J have experienced in the process of recruitment, with recruitment schemes are structured so that candidates can be selected according to the job being sought"
"Because I was not successful in getting the position, I am disappointed in the recruitment process.  I had to call to find out the outcome of my application.  I waited 3 days after the advised time of notification to do this.  From my perspective, Megan thought that I was not suitable for the role because she couldn't apply my responses to the phone interview questions as valid to the role.
I wish I had been selected for a face to face interview, or some sort of aptitude or ability test to measure my ability to perform the work.
I hope that I may be considered again for the position if it becomes available.
Thank you.     Jacinta O'Connor  jocindy2@hotmail.com "

Ask these questions earlier - I cant even remember the application process because this was about a month ago.
Ask the reasons why the candidate is fit for the program
Ask more questions so you can know the candidates better. 
Ask for extra documentation for a better segmentation.

As per my opinion recruitment process should be based on candidate experience & skills.
"As per my knowledge and experience of looking things, one cant be judge over the telephone or resume , if the recruiter meets an individual on one to one interview it clarifies most the doubts."
AS PER MY EXPERIENCE NEED TO BE LITTLE FAST IN PROCESS OF RECRUITMENT
"As per company rules & regulations and , now all company recruiters look only CA , CMA , ACCA candidates but some candidate have more talent and equally ca , cam , acca candidates, so requesting "
"As one of the pioneer firm in the world, I agree it is difficult for the company to recuit freshers from under graduation level. But I'm requesting the company's recruitment officers to consider freshers as they are very passionate to work in esteemed companies as that of yours. It's my personal dream to get into the company, but I don't know the path where I can reach you. That is why I don't want to miss the internship opportunity. Thank you."
"As of today, I do not have any suggestions."
"As of now, you don't have to because it's very unique and well secured."
"As of now, I think Johnson and Johnson has a great recruitment process, they make sure to get skilled people both for the growth of the company, for its reputation and for its customers as well."
"As of now, haven't been through thier recruitment process to comment on the same."
"As of now with the process I am satisfied with  the effort which u have taken to made an elaborated recruitment process.  According to me it will help myself as well the company to understand the standards of each other,  and it will make the process easier "
As of now the process is good enough but there is always room for improvements so I think J &J need to put efforts in making candidates aware of the job openings as many of my acquaintance were unaware of this thing.
"As of now the corporate is doing very well in the recruitment process . My only request is kindly let us know once the candidate has been shortlisted or not . So by the way it could be highly helpful for every one in order to proceed next .

very few of the corporate are doing this process & it was very helpful.  "
As of now no comments. Overall a good experience.
As of now no comments from my end
As of now it seems good. I will only be able to comment once I go through this process
As of now it is doing great. Process is easy.
"As of now I have yet to hear back about my application. I'm unsure if the survey link means I did not make it through initial screenings? 
If this is true, I would say thay an update on the application status via email could help ensure the applicant is up to date, even if the email is automated. This is just to ensure proper understanding of where the application process is and if it's still being process or not. "
As of now everything seems perfect to me...
As of now everything looks fine to me.
"As of my experience suggest , recruitment process is nice. Things needs to improve are prompt reply to candidates and about their resume and jnj opportunity "

"As many applicants might not be familiar with the job functions and titles in the organisation, it might be good to have a quick short survey about what the applicant is seeking in a job and have the system recommend some relevant open opportunities based on their inputs."
"as long as you are selecting manpower to generate quality products and money, all is well."
"As I'm not know how to give idea about of  process of recruitment but this is based on company rule  because every company has different process for selection ,as I'm not so much idea but the best way of selection is to face to face interview on that basis u may know abou that the person is eligible for that post or not and also know that the  how much knowledge of that person.The process of recruitment of Johnson & Johnson may be improve to give a campusing process in which they invites all students to appear and give their best for qualify the process ."
"As I still haven't heard back on this post, some of the questions related to process may not be relevant at this stage.
It may be a better to have this survey after the outcome of the applied post.

Hoping to get a reply at the soonest possible."
"As I have applied for numerous jobs, I find J&J recruitment process is satisfactory. Above all, I wish I could be short-listed for an interview to be able to discuss more in details. Thank You."
"As I can appreciate most applications are done via online process these days, however there's still something to be said about a personal experience, which I think more companies could take a back step every now and again to relive the personal feeling with face to face rather than a computer screen.

Its still the main reason why successful companies such as Johnson & Johnson still have active territory managers out on the road maintaining personal rapport.

Afterall, isn't that the main reason Johnson & Johnson prides itself on, a personal health & beauty experience & not just another product.  

Thanks for this opportunity.

"As I applied more than 2 weeks ago, sending an answer and following up (positive or negative answer) is a plus.

as i am qualified andexperienced they have not short listed my bio data. so improve quality check
"As I am not aware with it, so I think I am not proper one to give this answer. "
"As I am not a professional of HR & personnel domain, it is difficult to give any remarks on the same."
As good as it is. Fast and everything is clear. 
"As for what i have experienced, all were good and smooth. From the recruitment manager who was very informative, friendly, kept me updated for the progress and always reachable, upto the communication emails which was secured.
"
As for now You can speedup the process of recruitment. 
"As for me, it's also good to have a panel interview or to create a committee/group that will help to choose the best applicant suited for a vacant position. A group that comprises at least 5 members (HR Dept. and related Division or Department) for such vacant position."
"As far as the recruitment process is concerned, I am quite impressed for an immediate response by J & J. I think it would be  much better if there would be an more online assessment exam upon the submission of the application.But still, it's the company's right on how to assess and examine each application to select the qualified applicant suited for the position needed. J & J has known for its great reputation in business industry and I trust their recruitment process."
"As far as my concern , sometimes we get call from overseas that have some clarity issues and lagging that affect the interview."
As far as I'm concerned，the recruitment process is good enough now.
as far as i observed your company did a great job of keeping in touch with the applicant and a smooth process nothing have to improve great job. 
"As far as I can see, you have a good and standard recruitment process that help the applicant comfortable."
as different positions required different kind of requirement process. as for this job i feel this is one of the good method. 
"As applicant, it would be much appreciated if a feedback on the status of the application is provided. I have applied for few roles in J&J but have not heard anything on those applications. It made me wonder if the applications were processed, reviewed and given consideration. "
As an internal candidate I was not given enough time to prepare & felt it was not a fair process as I was already at a disadvantage having an unstable web connection
"As an established company, I believe that Johnson and Johnson already got the clear and systematic recruitment process. Having this survey as part of it is also good and reasonable to get the interest of the applicant to pursue application with the role indicated."
"As an enthusiastic job seeker, I will appreciate if you could revert the soonest please"
"As an applicant, I would really appreciate to receive an update on my job application process from time to time. Other wise, everything else is excellent.  "
"As an applicant, feedback regarding the application status would be appreciated. "
As an applicant I really appreciate companies who send email advise as to why an application wasn't successful.
"as an anticipating applicant it would be wonderful if i can view the current progress of my resume

thank you"
"As a senior recruiter I understood that my background industry was not ideal and that it might have been a leap to transition out of Retail into a different industry but I did find the response given to my application to be fairly generic. 

In my current role my main candidate care focus is to educate everyone that I come across as to why they were not successful entering into the process and what they can do in the future to improve their opportunities and in this case I felt like this was not offered, I understand if that is not your practice. 

I would love to be considered for opportunities in the future should they open but for now thank you for the opportunity to submit my application."
as a person who are really excited with some updates. recruitment process should also try to do some improvements on the turn around time on the updates of the status of ones application. aht of the TA should be set to be able to have improvement on the hiring process. we could revisit the process and identify the gaps and challenges as well. i hope these could help both the TA TEAM and the applicants.
"As a part of a very efficient process followed by your esteemed company, I really appreciate  for this initiative to gap  the recruitment process and understand overall needs. Therefore  a more detailed CV request may help to understand the work experience  as well as the desire for taking  up new job role and responsibility.Also applicant with change of job role responsibility, which is not  very similar to the advertised one may also be  consider by the recruiter. Also a telephonic interaction with the candidate will also help to to understand the  willingness to accept  the job role as per the advertisement."
"As a first step towards application process, the online information capture portal was appropriately designed to input details. 

There could be field inserted to capture information about Awards and Recognition which I found missing in the current online design. 

Thanks"
Arrange interview faster
Arrange a Call with perspectives for better understanding about Jobseeker and further evaluate.
Appreciate the return email if my application has been sent through successfully.

Appoint the right people with right attitude towards job and life..
Apply method can be simplified 
Applied job status is it viewed or not should be given.
Application status even if it is rejected so that I know that I am not fit for any role in J&J and will never pursue in future. 
Application should be acknowledged by human and not by system.
Application process till now was smooth. But it was possible because I coincidentally visited that job portal. Job postings can be done on many portals so that you receive more applications.
application process remains in in-process and the position get closed
"Application process is very simple, each position has been categorized in best possible way. So I have no suggestions for improvement of recruitment process."
Applicants will have the capability to view status of application.
Applicants who are interviewed should be contacted regarding progress (positive or negative).  Complete lack of communication has left me reconsidering my previous perception that J&J care about people
Applicants should be provided with an opportunity to view their status of application. 
Applicants should be intimated even if the applicants profile didn't match the companies requirements and got rejected. 
"Applicant required feedback or alternative proposal if avail, Keep in touch with high talented applicants. "
"Apology for not having comments
to this question because I am sure that
JnJ has a standard internal recruitment
process. "
Apllication process is quite good and easy to follow and understand. It would be better to notice the result and why to applicants who you do not want to recruit. 
"Apart from Job posting through outside source,  referral's to be encouraged and beneficiary ( Referred by ) in terms of candidature selection to be awarded.I am sure J&J would be definitely following the same process .Just thought of endorsing my thoughts."
Any online  written exams in which you can exeutive  a knowledge of personal on his professional so it will help in filter for initial step
Any form of feedback could have been provided to applicants who did not seem fit for the posts. This is my 2nd time to submit an application to johnson and johnson and the first time i applied seemed to be disregarded. 
Analytical or subjective based surveys .
An update on my application status will be grateful.  Thank you.
An update if the process is still active for an applicant.
An interaction with the HR on one to one basis which makes both the HR and the applicant understand the role and scope of work. This will also help in knowing the applicant aspirations and understanding towards the work culture and ethics of the company.
An immediate feedback whether the applicant is qualified for interview or not. 
"An Effective Recruitment Process, Comprising of Screening, Shortlisting, Interviewing, Recruiting, Hiring, and Training."
An early review of the applicant profile towards shortlisting & follow-up. 
"An amazing company. I applied a couple months ago but never heard back so am assuming I was unsuccessful to making it to an interview stage. Perhaps just some clarification along this process would be beneficial for the individual applying.

Kind regards."
"Am a small person to provide an input to a big giant like Johnson & Johnson.
"
"Always should look for moral value and Integrity at the time of recruitment,as because after recruiting the candidate will be part of the organization. "
Always should conduct face to face discussions (interviews).
always include estiamtion time from one recruitment process to the next one.
Always check the applicant's qualifications and recommendations from former employers.
although volume in processing new hires still they were able to process within time frame
Although the selection process id transparent but need more Transparent and faster process.
"Although J&J appear to be conducting this already, I believe being open-minded search, recruit, and hire all potential candidates globally that will bring great talent to the company provided that there is great fit is what all applicants would seek.  In fact, I believe this type of survey response by J&J prior to any potential interview consideration is a great method to further filter the applicants. This is the first such survey that I have taken in 25 years of my career.

Thank you."
"Although it has been more than one month since I applied for work in this site, I have no response such as ""reject"" or etc..."
"Although I've never spoken with anyone at the firm regarding my application, the process has been pretty seamless. No suggestions for improvement at this point."
"Although I appreciate the timely response of Johnson and Johson in informing me that, I am not selected for the position I applied. Therefore, I may not be in the best position to answer question. But, I would recommend, If  johnson and johnson, recruiting team, post the job advertisement on university social media link. It may have make it more clear for the applicant to prepare their application accordingly.

"Along with the survey , please do share the outcome of the application."
"Almost every applicant would like to receive their result of application as soon as possible. If Johnson & Johnson gives us the feedback more quickly, it could be helpful to every applicant. Thanks."
Allowed in many access like social media or JnJ goes to campus and conduct seminars or something for looking new prospective talented candidate
"Allow user to view job application process (eg. submitted, in process, interview, rejected)"
Allow for notification e-mails upon making their employment decision.
allow candidate to understand the process and status
All these aspects are good enough to recruit a person. 
ALL PARAMETERS OF RECRUITMENT IS VERY GOOD.SO NO COMMENTS.
"All of things good. My suggestion is to clear all recruitment schedule for candidate. If you can, it is more clear. Thanks. "
All looks good. Could add some technical questions. 
"All is well. But if the reply was sooner, would be great as it would ensure Johnson & Johnson would not lose any amazing talents just because other companies were quicker to get in touch with the candidates."
All is good and easy to understood
all good but it will be better with time management
all good
All good
All good
All are good
All are Good 
"Alerts of opening for the registered usernames. 
Make the application process more compact. "
"After the application process there has been no feedback to the candidate. If some kind of feedback mechanism is introduced it would help the candidate to track the status of his profile. 

Thank you !! "
After telephonic interview give the feedback or response to the applicant
After screening the candidate profile recruitment team has to inform candidate whether he is suitable for the applied post or not with some rejection reason so that candidate come to know about field of improvement. 
"After rejection the application, If the recruiter contact candidate  and provide a reason why he/she is not a good fit for the position which applied."
"After online applying for the position, till now no one contacted me nor reply me about candidacy, Kindly improve that. Candidates keeps hopes because of it. "
After my first interview it would have been helpful to have greater clarity regarding next steps and timing to decide the successful candidate.
"After going through Telephonic HR as well Technical Interview with Core team, i dint get any feedback from JnJ India team. I followed up over mail as well phone, but promised that we will respond you shortly but almost one month has been passed and still waiting for feedback. Its just open communication to inform the candidate that ""NO"" you are not right candidate or sharing tentative further process if ""YES"". I dont expect this kind of poor communication specially such a repute company like JnJ. Here question is not about Yes or No but all about informing the candidate timely to ensure we are on same page. If you need any support communication then i can forward the email communication for your reference. Feel free to drop me a mail or call me if you need any assistance but expecting strong action on the above. "
"After considering the qualifications, abilities, and skills sought by the role and submitting required documents,  I have very high hopes that Johnson and Johnson will be a good place to visit and continue with the hiring process in the Paranaque office. To date,  I have been properly communicated with the processes and procedures relative to my job career. "
After applying if you get a phone call for confirmation of submission .
"After applying for the position, I never heard anything back. No update. No email saying that I am not being considered. Nothing. I just assumed that my application probably never got looked at and applying was a waste of my time. Other companies like Verizon, BAE systems, Northrop Grumman, Aramark, Keyence and others all took time to connect with and interview me. I am still in the interview process with a few of these organizations and will probably end up working for one of these great companies. In other words, when qualified candidates apply, please let them know why they are not being considered. I probably won't take time  to apply to J&J in the future."
Advise the applicant immediately if he/she passed or failed in application. 
Advertisment on social media
Advertisement and to interview the candidates base on the potential and experiences and commitment 
Advertise more often about the job vacancies to attract competent people to join J&J. 
Administrative and organizational skills are one of the miles stones for a candidate in leading an organization to its success. I highly recommend all companies to hire candidature on a prohibitory period to asses their skills and marketing strategies. 
Additional feedback on progress through the process would be good. Applicants could accept other commitments having not known they were being considered.
"Adding recruitment feedback process through e-mail or SMS, even though the employee did't pass."
Adding an online live chat box in your career page would be really useful.
Adding a closing date for the position would be helpful. Also being able to contact the person listed at the bottom of the ad would be helpful. I personally tried to call the contact person for a week and only got voicemail.
"Add the CV or Resume of a candidate to the talent pool of J&J, and notice the candidate once J&J has a job opening which is matched with the candidate's background"

Actually not gone in details of the recruitment process. But I like the way the confirmation given & feedback taken.
Actually J&J is doing good but i believe u can still improve this in a very unique and innovative way. This is actually for the applied job position of associate manager medical affairs
"Actually I felt surprised when I received the interview call from the department manager because I had been rejected when I applied this position through Jobstreet.com.

"A) Job posting should provide more clarity on geographical location for preferred candidates. Like for Singapore location, ""Candidate from APAC region are welcome to apply"".
B) Job posting should state,  role is open/not open for international candidates who might require working visa in a particular country. 
C) If job posting is open to international candidates then, a statement such as ""visa services will be provided for international candidates if required""

Thanks !  
"
A very well done interface. Kudos to the team behind the inception of the recruitment page!
A very good process ..would appreciate if prospective candidates are updated on the status of their application process.
"A Tool can be developed where the Application's live status would be highlighted with respect to the stages involved in recruitment once any applicant submits his/her interest in the available vacancy.
"
"A text message or email of what is the update (if short listed or not) from the sent resume, maybe."
A suggestion to probably fasten the process. 
A stronger presence on digital front to attract talent.
A short voice record or video of candidates as an attachment for better filtering before interview.
A short test on language or skills during application process. 
"A section for candidates to input on what's their driving force towards achieving success and excellence. The questions should vary from time to time. The intention is to ensure that its NOT a 3rd party ""penning"" for candidates...but rather, its candidates themselves providing insights. 

From that perspective, candidates have the opportunity to display their talents and hiring-organization is able to select the most suitable candidates "
A screening call to evaluate fitment and not just based on Resume would give a better chance of finding the right candidate!
"A return reply when application is rejected. The reply based on what was the main reason, the factor contributed and how and what to improve in an application. "
A rejection email would be nice. 
A quicker response time on the application process. 
A quicker feedback about further process
"A quick hiring process and update of the application status, even if the candidate is not selected."
"A phone call, message or email to let me know if my application is accepted, pending or rejected, as it has been 17days since my application and I am still left unaware of the outcome. Thank you."
"A personal interview. 
The phone interview was difficult to respond to due to the poor quality of the overseas call. "
A person financial growth only through a reputed company. So please find out the one at the erliast 
A periodic update on the status of the application would be greatly appreciated
A more responsive feedback will be appreciated. 
"A more prompt and positive response to my application. Maybe a bit more aggression in acquiring talents who will add value to your organization. Better assessment, appreciation of qualified candidates expertise, experience. Better effort at probing for what applicants truly represent. Not to take applicants CV and credentials at face value. There are a lot of talents who are diamonds in the rough who have not been given the opportunity to truly highlight and showcase what they can do. A little self-serving suggestion but it can work to your advantage."
A more detailed description of how the recruitment process works. 
"A more clear recruitment track tool can be applied to check the whole process.

In all, the recruitment process is convenient. 
"
A more aggressive market
"A minor test to evaluate an applicant's knowledge in the subject can be considered as a part of his/her profile. This might help screen candidates better. Since the post is scientific, maybe an essay wherein the applicant can express his/her zeal for research and showcase any previous experience (After all not all research experiences/projects are professionally conducted, viz. I did a nice project as part of my college coursework) may be incorporated in the recruitment process."
"A initial conformation informing the candidate whether they have been shortlisted would be very useful.
"
"a HR manager or staff was should conduct direct interviews with good potential applicants so that it will recognize and know the ability, experience, expertise,strength in analyzing a problem that exists and development skills. "
A good interview process.
"A follow up on the application process would be great. Most of the times applicants are left on their own to figure out what has happened to their application.

In case the application is not shortlisted, applicant should get notified of the reason. If someone has shown interest in joining the company that calls for a better relationship building. 

It might just happen that a better fit job profile comes out in the future and informed applicant  may wish to consider that role."
"A few improvements i could think of
1. I am unable to search for last resume uploaded even despite logging in.
2. The link in the acknowledgement email does not directly open the profile. Infact asks one to re log in."
A feedback regarding candidature acceptance or non acceptance for the applied position is desirable.
a faster response to applicant 
A fast and reliable recruitment process. 
A fair chance for everyone who apply for the position
A direct interaction with the candidate at the early stages would help J&J  TA team to shortlist /finalize the candidate and also fasten up the recruitment process.
A Co-worker interview may contribute applicant's right understanding and good for working level in terms of build smooth transition.
A call to the applicant would be best to identify a specific strength and interpersonal skills available for the applicant. 
"A call or a telephonic conversation or a discussion at an initial stage would provide an insight into a prospective candidate's profile. Thus, there would be lesser chances of a good candidate being rejected/filtered merely on the basis of  years of work experience or any other such factor."
A call from company to discuss further recruitment stages would definitely serve for better preparation.
a call back (prerecorded) for candidates that did not make the shortlist. Create a story for publicity. 
"A call / email from HR personnel in 5 working days after the candidate submit their application would be nice, either the candidate will or won't be processed to the next step of recruitment."
"6 references are slightly hign number, it might be explored for other options i.e. a few key prople with calling check.

Please note that this is only my recommendation and it is case by case. Thank you."
"2nd interview with director via video is a good way, easy and comfortable. However,
I found internet trouble offen during interview. Therefore if you could improve technical issue, it will make interview smoothly. Thank you."
"1、Organize the interview as soon as possible，if can；
2、how many people suggests hiring every position；
"
"1] The job spec itself should clearly reference the ideal candidate's technical skills, character and potential for development. You need to offer a salary appropriate to the market.
2] Responsiveness gives way to processes and procedures which can make ""small company"" people feel restricted.
3]Social Media can play a very important role in finding both active and passive candidates, dependent on the type and level of the position.
4]How you Design and present your EVP, and business to the market has a very real impact on whether candidates want to work for you.
5]Think of all those Great people that you met they may have been a bit too junior or had a slightly different technical focus, but from a character fit perspective they were absolutely right."

I just want to emphasise more on diversity and inclusion as area of development in recruitment process. Candidates from different backgrounds and cultures should also be tried instead of looking for exact key for the lock.

2. Add more details in Job Posting:  Instead of posting just needed education and experience, include more details on day to day activities and keep posting as attractive as possible. 

3. Include HR as first step in recruitment process: I often find HR as last step in recruitment process especially in sales interviews. Some qualified professional should first screen candidates, followed by managers to ensure process is consistent with all applicants."
"1. Share feedback on grounds for unsuccessful application;  this will allow applicant to better understand needs and strengths.

Recruitment process for them to fill the gaps where is  the vacancy , and HR peoples is looking to hire the people from the other reputed companies and sometimes they do not understand the credentials of the candidate .It is a tendency the Concerned Department Head where the gaps, not selected competent people rather than him due to job insecurity . In that area Top management should emphasize more for recruitment process even at Grass root level .

"Следует улучшить обратную связь с кандидатами. Когда я общался с HR специалистом, мне сказали, что перезвонят с ответом. Но ответа так и не поступило, даже в письменном виде, что меня расстроило. Надеюсь, вы примите к сведению этот момент. "
"Мне очень импонирует позиция французов к своему языку на всех уровнях ведения бизнеса. Поэтому, как мне кажется, все коммуникации на государственном языке Российской Федерации больше бы соответствовали репутации Джонсон и Джонсон как работодателя мечты."

С учетом высокого качества продукции, выпускаемой компанией Джонсон и Джонсон, а также не достаточно высокой конкуренции на рынке СНГ, именно яркая информативность и агрессивность рекламы в купе с оригинальностью и юмором дадут нужный уровень (рост) продаж! Позволю себе несколько фривольную шутку относительно Вас: ""На могильном камне основателей компании Джонсон и Джонсон написано:""Мы так заботились о Вашем здоровье, что потеряли свое?"".

"Делайте ваши объявления о вакансии захватывающими

Многие рекрутеры берут описание вакансии из должностных инструкций и других источников, написанных в целях, отличных от маркетинговых, просто скучно. Рекрутеры должны переписать их так, чтобы продать кандидату интересные аспекты работы и дать ему идею о том, как он может повлиять на будущее. В самом крайнем случае, рекрутер должен сверить свое описание вакансии с описанием вакансии конкурента с тем, чтобы убедиться, что его выглядит более убедительным.

You should really improve feedback for rejected candidates. Getting to know you were rejected from a survey is highly unprofessional.
You should give chance to out board candidates 
"You need to return to the candidate in a timely manner with feedback. I sent the application a month ago, but I did not receive a reply. I was applying on Trade Matketing specialist in Rostov-on-Don"
"You must be advertised on more than one site to arrive to a large number of job seekers 
But my congratulation on your recruitment application 
Best regards "
You might want to look at someone's resume and determine if they have a skill set that would work for a different job that you are hiring for and then interview them for that job.  I felt like my application wasn't even looked at because I didn't have a degree in HR.  
"You might ask, would you take yourself in your company?
"
You have to be faster in the selection process.
You have done good job..
"You expect me to give feedback on the application process, when I received zero feedback from you on why my application, which I probably spent a lot more work on than you did in the screening process,  was rejected?"
"You could split the job description into three parts: a) must have skills; b) nice to have skills and c) a company specific layout . If the first condition isn't accomplished by the candidate - an instant message with not applicable for the job seeker can be sent. If the applicant passes the first condition(s), a face to face interview should be a must do. At the third part (c) the company can work out a more specific way to present the job - the description is alike almost all companies in the pharma industry."
You could involve in the recruitment process avoiding robots to select the application in subject 
You could introduce into the survey questions better suited to the role for which a person is a candidate
You could inform me about my current application status.
You could include a personnality quizz in order to see if we fit with the job whether trying to know if we meet all your expectations in terms of competencies only. Because candidates that have both motivation and a personnality fitting with the job can do a better work that someone that had all the competencies required before entering your company.
"You could improve by sending a reply to an application, not only a survey list"
You could actually get back to your applicants with a clear answer. I've applied to nearly a dozen roles at J&J in Zug over the past several years and I nearly never hear anything back - positive or negative. It's sad that the only email I've received from you all is an invitation to participate in this survey!
You can try to put the job placement in a clearer way and then provide a feed-back of the reasons for not being called for an interview
"You can take more personal discussion. Now I hear from your recruiters that a job released. I apply and I get almost instant mail that I am not eligible for the job. I don't know why. 

Kind regards

Would be great if it could provide a little more insights on what the potential incumbent would be doing instead of a generic Job Description. So a more role/geography specific JD.

Would appreciate to have a personal call in order to understand business needs and my matches with my profile to find a proper position in the organization. 
"Would appreciate if J&J inform me whether I'm underqualified or overqualified to the job, whether the academic major or the field of previous expertise was or not matching the expectations (since the field of the degree required was not mentioned), or if there were simply sufficient candidates to constitute a short list for a first interview. Thank you for caring."
"Within the candidate profile page on the J&J website, it would be useful to view the current progress of an application. If this facility already exists, it could be made easier to view."
"With the new tool it provides a lot more visibility in the application processes. Somethimes, it takes quite some time until the application move on to another status. Reasons for not beeing considered would be nice to receive to improve."

"When i was referred by a J&J worker , i tried to apply through the mail which was sent automatically from J&J. But i couldn't make it. It took me to correct page in order to enter my username and password. The ""Title"" was also right. However , it didn't let me pass by the username and password which was provided by the incoming mail before. So , I had to send my resume directly to the local HR department and informed them that i was referred by their colleague.

Afterwards, they invited me and my interview has been successfully performed and i am now in the assessment period which will probably last for 2 weeks max. Hopefully , it would be positive for me.

"well the recruitment process was a straight forward application through a local platform. 

For a company with a long story, you cant decide on how valuable or experience a candidate can be only through a recruting platform. A least interviews would be a plus not the decesion of the HR."
Well organised and systematic procedure. Provides clarity for the persons seeking for job at Johnson and Johnson company.
Well I don't really know what can Johnson & Johnson do to improve the recruitment process because I haven't been through all the processes of recruitment yet. 
Well established MNC had lot talented people to improve the recruitment process.  So asking suggestion for improvement is only to get an idea.  They will accept idea to develop and always talented people will make recruitment process in extreme position for this reputed firm.

"Today, there are too many candidates even for a very skilled and experienced position, so the recruitment specialists and the company human resource managers have an hard task to face.
I think that, companies should look for senior and experienced applicants,directly, starting from the beginning of the recruitment process, in order to better understand valuable and deep skills then, how much candidates will match not only to the actual position but also looking at wider needs of the company.
In my experience applicants are often filtered by few parameters (example: business sector), so the risk is to loose the opportunity to see candidates that bring a good potential, skills and methodologies acquired in other industries.

"To be perfectly honest i can only describe my experience in recruitment. When i was in Dizin i was the clinic manager and sometimes i needed to recruit new staff. The HR gave me about 20 CV for analysis and some of them were very poor, still i called every one for an interview. At the end i didn't always admit the person with the top CV because, in person, it was completely different. I value very much the human personal contact, i do believe it is the key to success. I understand that in very large companies it is not easy to interview all the aplicacions, but, in my humble opinion, i think companies should not focus completely on the person CV but focus on the willpower of that person to work there. Thank you very much."

Till now the process is very clear and professional
Till now I don't recall any response from Johnson & Johnson on this application after the confirmation that my application has been received. At the same time this role seems to be posted a long term so I'm not sure if this role is real.
Ti give an idea about the delay to get a response following to the application.
"Thus far the application process is well managed and leaves a good impression. However, the process is still at an early stage as I did not yet get feedback on my application itself. Looking foward to further steps with Johnson & Johnson. "
"Those tasked with screening applications need to be more experienced, thereby able to use their discretion more to look at the bigger picture. Sometimes candidates don't have the requisite experience called for by the role yet have other skills and experience which might be transferable. Also, how is one to obtain experience if one is never given a chance to prove ones worth. Strict, rigid adherence to the job description by recruiters early on in the process is denying J&J excellent talent. This is highly disappointing from an applicants perspective."
Thorough description of the position. Nice having the opportunity for the survey. Nothing to improve.
"This would be out of my area of expertise, so I don't know how valuable it would be, but I find it frustrating how all of the jobs posted (and there's a lot of jobs), require specific qualifications that make me disqualify despite my experience and university degree in Biomedical Engineering.
This can be improved depending on the status of applications to J&J
If J&J is getting more than enough applications that match all the specific qualifications criteria, then the specific qualifications should remain to screen the less relevant candidates.
If J&J is not getting perfect matches, then it would be useful to look for candidates with less specific criteria that are willing to learn and train to become competent. Somehow like McDonald's burger franchises do it, but not as broad.
From my former experience as a Sales and Service Biomedical Engineer, I expect that I would be able to learn 50% of what is required for the job in the first two weeks, and 90% of it by the end of the third month. I would hate to be disqualified by this learning curve.
I would like to hear an HR person's opinion on this, and in case I need to sub-specialize in the Biomedical Engineering domain, would they please let me know which sub-specialty is in the most demand?

"This time the recruitment process was very good and smooth. I prefer J&J direct recruitment rather than through the agencies. The recruiter Hollie Valler was highly professional and with a great attitude, listening, understanding and accommodating. The job description matched my skills and I would love to come back to J&J to work. However after careful consideration with the family I had to cancel the interview face to face as this particular vacancy was a contract one and I have to look for a permanent position.
I always thought very highly of J&J as a company after working only 4 months on a short contract at Pinewood, Wokingham. The people are exceptionally good and do their jobs properly. "

They have very strong global process 
They have to get into touch with the job seekers by calling them. They have to fix an interview with each and every person who has applied for the job. Even if the candidate is not selected then you have to give him an opportunity to improve himself and tell him to come back after some months. Even if he doesn't come back after few months you have to contact the candidate and fix an interview. So that the candidates will get more hope on your company and they keep on trying there thinking that they will be selected some or the other time. Even I did not get any call or sms from your company regarding the job opportunity. Like I was waiting for your call.
They could ask more dedciri questions about
They can post their job offer in a famous website like Indeed or the LEEM. It will be more easier to find them if there are a plateforme between Johnson & Johnson and us.
"They can keep in touch with the applicants , either for positive or negative feedbacks , As well as involving them on the process cycle and updates .
"
They can have the interview with my and see how my skill and experience fit this job. 
They can expand and train new staff without experience and give more opportunities to those who want to work for a azienza so important
"They can do skype interview for applicants that are not resident at the country where they are applying for the vaccancy , as a source of being an equal opportunity employer 
Giving every fit canndidate the right to join and follow his career aspiration whereever he/she wants 
No barriers or boundries to hinder their dreams 
Thank "
"They can do face-to-face intewiev, with some assestments evaluating to my business experience. Also, they can get information while checking my references info. "
They can do a better job of informing the prospective candidate of the status of the recruitment and any follow up.
"They can also ask the candidate to provide some quick skill and behavioral summary matching the profile so that they get to have a quick way of knowing about the candidate.

Also, from candidate perspective they can give more information about the team and their contribution or major wins etc."
There was one question about woking permits that I found confusing but other than that all was fine.
"There was absolutely no communication from the point of application until I was asked to complete this survey.  Some sites send an automated email saying thank you for the application and if you don't hear in 5 working days, please accept the rejection.  It would be nice to have something....."
There was a phone screen by a recruiter followed by a phone call with the hiring manager
there should be job details and dont be afraid to test canditates
There should be equal employment opportunity.  
"There must be process feedback.
The feedback to the applicants is more descriptive."
There is nothing major to improve.
There is no problem with the current process of u 
There is no Need Go improve the recruitment process 
There is always room for improvement
There is always a room for improvement. Friendly and high-experienced team combined with motivation can reach a lot.
"There is a process to it, can't give a one sentence answer."
"there is a problem about website. maybe it is about my connection but, when uploading attachments, it does not wait to attach, directly move forward to the nex stage.
about HR policies: please do not emphasize only the sector-industry experience, but consider the applicants who can make good contributions in terms of data."
There is a need to speed up the recruitment process. 
"There is a difference in recruitment and talent search, I personally believe the process was somewhat sketchy. In my opinion talent search is based on not to just see the candidate can perform that role its more so what new changes a candidate can bring to organization to make things cheaper, better, faster and safer. Few cents of mine!"
"There could be additional questions concerning the potential employee's skills, in order to understand a little bit better about strenghts and weaknesses"
"There could be a clearer indication of the ""status"" and progress of an application. I spent a few weeks on 2 different occasions, unsure if I was going to be considered or taken forward. As a result of this, I chased up with the talent Acq team and managed to push things along from my side. 
I understand this is in part due to a great deal of recruitment activity taking place in the region I am joining. From another point of view, it's almost a good test of tenacity to chase up and show genuine interest. Maybe that's something you're testing in the background! I feel it paid off! "
"There are three things that could be improved:
1. the ""standard"" career portal is not in sync with the portal you reach once logged in as a candidate - not all roles are visible on the standard site
2. the process is not transparent and it takes a long, long time to get a first reply after the standard ""we received your application, thank you"" message. It would be great to get some kind of intermediate update on where things are.
3. the application tool is counterintuitive: in order to upload a new version of a CV (I had applied for a job some time ago), I had to open the old application and delete its attachments."
"There are 3 suggestions:
1- Include the recruitment process in the job post with a time frame for each process, so, it will be very easy for each candidate to know the time frame and where is his/her application in the process.
2- ATS keywords measure rate or percentage cab tell the candidate if the CV will be considerable or not from the beginning
3- for the failed candidates, now you have their applications and CVs. I guess it will be very proactive if there will be a vacant position match their CVs automatically the system could suggest their name without applying "
The written feedback after selection process for all applicants should be manadatory not by request .
"The work is my life, and the money also. "
The whole process has been very smooth and efficient. 
The whole proces was user friendly.At every stage I knew what to do. 
The web didn't work properly. I think to technically simplify the application form will be a great improvement and will avoid such kind of problems.
The user of soft lenses which I am will have inevitably lived one positive additional that a salesman who will know only his product description
The user journey is better however there is scope for improvement.
"The Transparency of the Online Application Process could be improved, because there was no controll of the Documents I have sent."
The time between the phone call and interview could be shorter 
"The time between applying for the position and, in my case a rejection was way too long (more than 6 weeks). It would be desirable to shorten such first desicion round. "
The test which you provide to applying person is so much amazing. Through this company person can identify right candidate for right position in company.
"The Taleo system is horrible for the candidate. I wanted to upload my CV and cover letter, but as I had signed up using my LinkedIn account the system told me I had already completed my application even before I had uploaded the documents. I had to hunt around to find somewhere where I could do this and I still have no idea if anyone has seen them. 

I would certainly have liked to have had a quick chat about the role before deciding to apply, but as that is not possible I have had to spend time creating a suitable CV and cover letter just to try to get the opportunity to speak to someone to decide whether this is a suitable role for me.

I also applied for this role two months ago, but have heard absolutely nothing from either a person or the system about what is happening, except for the normal automatic response after my application.

The Taleo system means a terrible candidate experience where the candidate has no idea what is happening, or even if his CV is available to the recruiter (assuming the candidate could find where to upload it). Taleo does not reflect the 'Credo' set out on the website and it has certainly reduced my interest in working for JNJ. "
The Talent acquisition process and steps should be part of the webpage and also for internal employees some visibility with regard to the status of their application
The system used for connecting interviewers with interviewees is completely inflexible. It does not allow to contact the interviewer in case of doubt or issue
"The system to load application forms was very very poor, it took me 5 attempts and 3 days as somehow website was not loading ."
The survey questions should be more.
The survey itself shows the interest in the feed back and this will definitely help to refine the process. Appreciate this mail and sure you doing great. 
The survey can be sent on the same day of the application.
The suggestions and information of the staff working in the field can be consulted. Pre-screening test can be done by mail to measure the personality and skills of the candidates according to the company values. Persons who are anticipated to qualify for the final result may be invited to the interview.
"The speeding up and more frequent information during the process might be helpful.


regards,
"
The speed of answering
"The size of datas which can be uploaded, could be bigger. "
The site need to be more interactive 
"The site is very intuitive.
I invite you to keep tu as it is.
Thanks "
"The site for uploading documents is confusing:
- too much content
- not clear what size the document can be
- I didn't saw straightaway what type of document I should upload (motivation letter or resume). Normaly I should upload first motivation letter and then the resume. At J&J it is different, I remember?
- I couldn't delete/ change the uploaded file "
the selection process may be improved by selecting the most suitable to play for an online test on the actual candidate's knowledge and aptitude on the actual search criteria.
The response was prompt and appreciated. However there was no feedback as to why my CV was not considered suitable. I understand that this is sensitive and time-consuming but there may be other roles for which the applicant may be considered
"The response times are very good. On the same day a confirmation of the application.
On the following day the survey.
Perhaps you could ask more differentiated questions in the survey.
Until now everything is perfect.
"
"The response of the Recruiting Team to the applicant if short-listed or not, as the positive or negative reply is taking time to receive by the applicant."
The requirement procedure is ace.My opinion is to have update about the job Position which we have applied for.And make sure about the profile which our profile is selected are not.
"The reputation , the values, the product information!"
The recruitment was a smooth process and I look forward to taking the recruiting process even further with Johnson & Johnson
The recruitment staff and entire process was excellent. Clodagh Costello was the HR person with whom i dealt with. I must say she was a pleasure to deal with and excellent at her job. 
"The Recruitment Software Solutions can help to check the online applications which includes: Background Checks, Employment Verification, etc, which is effective and efficient in selecting process. However, the Software System may incorrectly analyse the applications. For example, the applicants may filled the information in the wrong section within the application form. By using the Software System to analysing the applications may result talented applicants are losing their chance being selected. 
Moreover, the talented applicants may not show that they are good candidates based on their applications.Therefore, a different approach should be taken, such as manually reading by HR recruiter after the Software System had checked to give a fair chance to Johnson & Johnson`s applicants."
"The recruitment progress should not be long and dreary, it should be strong and jump straight to the point. During the application page its been very interesting however creating a new account in the recruitment website is time consuming for the submitter for example.

The Website should connect to link'ed in or facebook from there the HR should know all about the applicant, personality, lifestyle etc, things a CV does not say.

lastly Keep the applicant up to date with the process of his application"
"The recruitment procoess is very intuitive, simple and easy. Is doesn't take too much time to apply. At this point, i don't see any improvment opportunity in the recruitment process, i thinks it works fine."
"The recruitment process, at the application level, was OK. I was quite surprised not being at least contacted. I have 10 years of experience mainly in recruitment & pharmaceutical sector (4 years at Novartis & 1 year atBristol-Myers Squibb with some very positive references for both experiences). 
Best regards, Sophie Remida"
The recruitment process was relatively simple . I found it easy as compared to many other online sites 
The recruitment process was indeed already great.
"The recruitment process was good organised, you have perfect HR Gabriela Puflerova, I like the way she and supervisor Eva led the interview. No any concern."
"The recruitment process was extremely well done. I can have only positive comments. 
The only improvement I would recommend is to give the feedback and debrief to the candidate after the interviews about the result and the decision taken - whether it is positive, negative or still in progress. 
"
The recruitment process was easy to complete so I don't see any improvement needed. 
"The recruitment process was easy and comfortable. And very fast. 
"
"The recruitment process was clear, short and fit's perfectly for me. There is nothing to improve regarding this process. "
"The recruitment process was clear and intuitive. 
However, it took a long time before any notification of further steps in the process."
"The recruitment process was an enjoyable and a valuable learning experience. The online tests were more realistic (not ridiculously hard equations you'll never need!) to complete. 

The questions in the application were revelant and not tricky. They were worded in a way which was easy to understand and I didn't feel like I was trying to be caught out which is what I found in a lot of other applications. 

At the assessment centre I found Karen really welcoming an friendly as she put myself and the other candidates at ease straight away. I didn't find it daunting in anyway and actually found it enjoyable and fun. 

"
The recruitment process to my knowledge is far more better in Johnson and Johnson compared to other Competitor in the market  as it is the well known brand and obviously well developed company like Johnson will have their own way of recruitment.
The recruitment process should take steps to contact candidates for an interview and communicate the response also failed.
The recruitment process should be fast.
The recruitment process of Johnson and Johnson is very perfect and hope to maintain the same in coming future.
The recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson is fairly good. Could be improved with respect to the response time. 
"The recruitment process never took off. While I understand that I may have not been suited for the position, I find it somehow rude to receive a survey about the recruitment process in which I basically stood no chance."
"The recruitment process is very good because it is focused on competencies needed to be employed in J&J. I think, you might add the place where would be possible expression of additional own opinion (like here) - for example in the first question. This will help in getting to know better the potential employee."
the recruitment process is very good
the recruitment process is very good
The recruitment process is very complicated. For me it is easier to send you the application documents by e-mail.    
the recruitment process is simply the best
the recruitment process is satisfying so far. 
The recruitment process is really good and easy to handle. I really appreciate the modality of the portal and the clear instructions. 
The recruitment process is quite clear; the portal for applications is simple and intuitive. Is no answer for each application submitted. I hope to play a role in this important multinational.
The recruitment process is professional enough.
The recruitment process is precise on the official website. The steps to complete the procedure is simple and easy to understand. Its perfect!
The recruitment process is perfect.
"The recruitment process is ok, it's easy to apply through internet. Maybe a feedback to candidates after CV evaluation will be a factor that will increase candidate's confidence."
"The recruitment process is not an issue.
On the contrary it is very professional, but in my opinion the selection process for the adequate candidate should be a little bit open for more than specific needs concerning the job role. 
You cannot always find the right candidate for a certain job with a 100% accurate requierments. Sometimes the perfect candidate can have 50% of what the job role requiers. It all comes down to the interview itself."
"The recruitment process is good but I still have not heard how far my application went. 
The mail for this survey did not go in general folder (gmail) but where promotions go. I would almost miss it.

Best regards"
The recruitment process is generally clear. I hope JnJ will start sponsoring candidates outside their original country.
The recruitment process is extremely awesome!. I believe the recruitment team is doing great. ;)
The recruitment process is easy and intuitive; I hadn't problems with it.
"the recruitment process is done professionally. the confirmation email was sent instantly upon applying for the job. this is my second email and so far no negative comments or opportunity for improvement are to be given
thank you,"
The recruitment process is clear and simple and would be hard to improve.
the recruitment process is at a high level. Fast response is an advantage
The recruitment process is accurate so it doesn't need to be improved.
"The recruitment process is a simple one , satisfactory for me ."
The recruitment process in Johnson & Johnson surely fair and done by professional way . But i think if the company can give a call to some of the candidates to clarify some points before exclude their applications as sometimes the resume doesn't explain all the skills and experiences .
The recruitment process if good already.
The recruitment process has gone well so far. Its still early days and since the recruitment process is not yet complete I do not have any suggestions on what can be done to improve the recruitment process.
"The recruitment process has been highly efficient, with a great job role, matched to my own key skills. Regular  updates to detail developments throughout the recruitment process and next steps, would be a request to maintain the high standard already experienced."
The recruitment process for face to face interview technique will be more effective.
The recruitment process could be also in Polish;)
"The recruitment process could also consider, the candidates proficiency, by having a short interview, so as to understand the aptitude, positivity and knowledge he or she bringforth to the organisation."
"The recruitment process at Johnson and Johnson is a wonderful experience because you receive an answer back in a timely manner.

Thanks"
"the recruitment process at Johnson & Johnson is pretty good so far
I will be able to tell more once I will have done the 1rst interview next week
"
"The recruiting process with Johnson&Johnson it was very professional and also very enjoyable. All the four people I spoke with were very inspiring, motivated and managed to transmit a very positive message about Johnson&Johnson. My motivation to apply for the position and work with Johnson&Johnson has increased exponentially thanks to the conversations I had with the four members of the Johnson&Johnson team. "
The recruiting process is quite straight forward and intuitive
The recruiting process does not need an improvement.
The recruiment process is realy good.
the recritment process in Johnson and Johnson is successfull because since you apply for the position there is  a quick feedback  from them and they  contribute  and help  to follow your chances in the application process.
"The recent changes to the internal job search website has removed a lot of the functionality, and made the experience much less user-friendly.  The jnj.com/careers page for external applicants allows for more filtering than the new internal job board page.  "
"The programm should work for all employees - so that they have the chance
to apply for a job at ""my career"""
"The process was very smooth and the interviews extremely informative, helpful and very agreeable!
The only factor was the one test with the F-number and the figures where I don't see a real benefit. Also the personality test, was did not fit as good as others. There where other test which I have made in the past which pointed out my personality much better (also those points where I first thought they don't match me, but with being honest to my self, they did match!).
I appreciated very much being able to have an honest talk with Fabio Breil about my current situation! I appreciated both interviews with each and every person! Congratulations that you have such professional and precious persons on board! "
"The process was smooth and quick. It would be great to get feedback, why one isn't selected for further consideration, but I understand that this is difficult dur the large amount of applications you receive. Especially if that is based on a factor such as expected salary, or something else that can be negotiated in further process, when you get to know the candidate better."
"The process was slow between first and second interview stage, could be quickened up."
"The process was simple and understandable enough.

Regards"
The process was simple and self guiding
The process was simple and efficient. No improvement needed.
The process was fine there was no need for improvement
"the process was clever and simple.
this survey is the  proof of the company's interest for the employees"
"The process was clear and smooth.
Thanks"
The process was clear 
"The process took a long time.
Give an indication, how long it could take"
"The process so far was seamless.  Having worked with a number of large organisations involved in Change Management, I look forward to meeting the team at Johnson & Johnson to further explore the current opportunity.  "
"The process should start immediately F2F interview. I understand this is the first step, but to identified competences / experience / skills of the candidate it’s vital to start F2F meetings.

"
The process of recruitment is Very goog .I suggestivi to extended the evaluation process using linkedin connections
The process of johnson and johnson is one of the best as a multinational organization. I can suggest only adding the time frame of the whole recruiting process which will help the candidate as well.
The process needs to be accelerated
"The process needs to be a little more transparent, accepting that the level of the role can extended the process, the absence of an update should be reviewed, even if the update is that it is stil progressing. With regard to this roles I applied on the 7th of April, I requested an update on the 4th of May and then again on the 11th of May (having recieved no response from the 4th), this process could be improved. "
The process itself was quite smooth and intuitive. I found it easy to use.
"The process itself was OK. The outcome for me was just a polite ""NO"" leaving me in a position without understanding what was wrong. "
The process is very appropriate.
"the process is still like a black box, not sure what the parameters on which the candidates is selected. Certainly not on talent or qualification. May be luck plays a huge role.."
"The process is really clear and straightforward.
The only small remark I have is following. On the career website you ask for an email address to log in. Loging with email unfortunately doesn't work and the username needs to be used to make it work.
It's a minor technical issue but I'm sure it would help some applicants."
"The process is quite straightforward (at least in the preliminary steps, which is where I am at the moment), so I've no suggestions for the moment"
The process is quite slow. I have applied over a month ago and recieved only one response saying an interview will be scheduled shortly. I have not heard back since
"The process is quite drawn out. You, as a candidate have to be very active in the due dilligence, not always feasible if you are full time working too. Gives your existing employer time to negotiate with you to stay."
"The process is professional and so is the approach  so far. I went through screening phase with HR & then the first round of interviews. I was able to feel the transparency in the communication , the respect as well as the positive healthy culture. Looking forward for further steps to be able to give a holistic feedback .   "
The process is pretty fast and straight forward. Probably you could include a quick application option on linkedin without necessarily having to go to company website.
"The process is performed above average market practice in terms of communication with candidate and reveals good practices concerned with rejected candidates
Neverthless, some better process control could prevent, as in my case, lack of status feedback on one of my two applications, granted by asking for candidates feedback instead ;)"
the process is ok
The process is not personal. As an experienced professional I would like to know why I am not a good fit for a position. I only received a standard e-mail that I have not been selected.
The process is just fine.
"The process is interesting, but it does not replace direct contact with an interview."
The process is good no much changes needed.
The process is fine in my opinion but i think they need to speed up the process to the interview level as soon as possible to better judge the candidate's skill and proficiency. 
The process is fine for me. Appreciate the transparency you give about the process. 
The process is fine as it is and works for what is needed.  No changes needed.
The process could be quicker
"The process could be more faster and possibly including a contact by phone, or better, a personal contact at the HQ. It migth be a stronger position for the candidate cause, for example, to explain the CV and the motivation for changing the position. "
"The process could be a bit better if the responses are faster. However, the process is intuitive and I feel confortable during it."
"The process can be improved by getting back to the candidate. I applied close to 6 weeks ago and have not heard back from the TA team.
Some clarity into the hiring process would add a lot of value and credibility to the hiring process regardless if I get the job or not.
And having not been contacted for an interview or feedback on my application or profile is a bit frustrating especially for someone who is keen on joining one of the most reputable healthcare companies in the world. 
Frankly I stopped checking the career site at J&J as this has not seemed to get me any FaceTime and now I am looking at alternative routes just to get an interview.."
"The process as such is already good. Structured feedback positive or negative, is highly appreciated. "
The procedure was quite clear and easy to follow and the information provided permitted the applicants to understand what was being offered and what was expected.  Perhaps an indication regarding approx. pay would be appreciated by applicants.
"The potential candidate's should be given the benefit of the doubt, if they satisfy the majority of the job criteria then final decision on their abilities should be made after an interview or an online assessment.

Not providing a cover letter should not be a deciding factor, a candidates CV would cover all that information.
     "
"The portal can be improved to check the status of the application, Whether the application has been considered for the particular position. "
The portal can be challenging. Sometimes the structure/layout seems to change when using search functionality.
"The phone interview as a first step, it was rather superficial and risky for an employer to properly evaluate a candidate's skills and experience. And also provide feedback, especially after middle level roles. A little more transparency in the recruitment process wouldn't hurt."
"The person who applies job posting should be informed as fast as possible regardless of accepted or not. Like me a lot of people apply job posting and we need feedback.We are curious about whether we are accepted or not.Apart from this,everything is fine."
The organisation can improve recruitment process by increasing publicity in future processes.
"The opportunity was relevant. I have no clue on why HR did not proceed further.
"
"The only thing that wasn´t ok during my application, was that I forgot my password on J&J webpage, and when I tried to recover it I couldn´t do it. The only message from the webpage was that there was a problem. I had to Apply with a new user and email account."
"The Online-application is user-friendly, but it should be better if the overviews of the job advertisements could be found also on the website under the folder ""Carrer"". Actually I have found this job advertisement via the www.stepstone.de, but when I wannted to find out the same advertisement on the jnj-website, I needed to know exactly in which ""Function"" the advertisement belonged to. Otherwise I needed to use the FIND-option to shorten my searching."
"The online video interview is explained in English, even in the examples before you start. But when you start the video interview, questions appear in Dutch, so I wasn't sure whether to respond in English or Dutch. Maybe it would be possible to say something about the language that is expected, in the email with the invitation for this video interview. "
The online system is poor.
"The online process is very impersonal by nature. I think it would be great if you have a process whereby you quickly identify candidates with a good match (skills and experience) and send them a personal note that you are actively considering their application, rather than a system generated email."
"The online process is much slicker than some other similar companies, you have to register and keep login in details for most applications, with LinkedIn been the major starting point of most applicants it would be great to only use one direct process. A segment to show examples of previous work to strengthen my own application would be a plus, as current standards for cover letter and CV don't let you expand on successful results/work experience. "
"The online application was easy and straightforward. However, an improvement could be made by providing more information about the progress of the recruitment process. "
"the online application process needs some improvements. I suggest have an explanation of the online application process, the steps and how to amend. Also to clearly state the point at which the application is submitted. As currently the button just states 'next' at 90% complete so I submitted my application before attaching my covering letter as I did not realise it was going to submit and thought I would be able to go back after completing the other pages before finally submitting. "
The online application is swift and friendly to applicants. 
"The on line application was simple and the idea of the survey very good.
I do not know the next steps of this process therefore I cannot comment right now. Happy to answer this question as soon as I know the end to end process.
Kind Regards
Cristina"
The most important task to do in the recruitment process is to assess CVs received and later on candidates interviewed based on the competency framework designed for the position to be filled.
"The more streamlined, intuitive and too the point a system is, the better. It facilitates ease of use and helps with workflow management. "
"The minimum standard of measure is to provide a basic 'yes' or 'no' feedback to the candidate regarding their application through emails, which J&J does not follow. Definitely room for improvement there."
The may introduce some genral points of their policy which is can attract people to join
"The main problem is that the electronic application is not a real judge for the person skills and experience ,at least you need any other tool to provide a real assessment "
"The mail that I have receive for doing this survey, at lest to me, do not give a clear clue if you finalyy still being in the process or just J&J is making you a survey."
The lead times on coming  back to  the applicant with the outcome of their application;to date I haven't yet  received feedback on my application.
"The key point I observed during the application process is, it was really fast and intuitive, but for the returning applicants it was quiet difficult to track their applications through the career site. It would be really good if this was implemented in an easier to find location on the webpage."
"The Johnson & Johnson recruitment process is clear and easy to follow.  I personally appreciate the return letter that I received.   

Keep up the good work, and I look forward to working for Johnson & Johnson!"
"The Job title doesn't fit the job description, can be misleading"
"The job posting was not easy to find. The respective websites were rather disorganised. 
However, the application process itself was then easy. "
"The job posting provided a lot strategic and details description of the role. Relatively, the requirement on candidate is less. As candidate, I hope to know more exception from Johnson & Johnson. "
"The job posting is in more than one location site LinkedIn and is the company's website
Showing jobs in recruitment websites most prolific
"
"The job post was removed from the job posting page and I have not received any feedback or update on my application. The question is, is the job still vacant? or got filled up? A faster feedback is appreciated from the hiring team as I was really excited to apply for that opportunity at Johnson and Johnson feeling that is my next career move and development.

Thank you."
"The job portal works very well to see the the status of the submission however it would be beneficial to also provide some transparency surrounding role submission closing dates. 
"
"The job description was very long and comprehensive - possibly a little too long and might be intimidating to some and put some candidates off. Not sure if the concept of listing absolutely every duty and responsibility and then every desirable qualification from candidate to achieve ""best fit"" really works, thinking out of the box with a flexible, agile mindset within talent search could also lead to finding diverse minded, agile employees who are very capable of fulfilling the role well. So my only improvement is to shorten job descriptions and summarise better. "
"The Job description did not provide specific skill or experience requirement. I applied on Friday evening and Saturday morning I received a response that may candidature has been unsuccessful while as per the Job Description, I met the selection criterion."
The JNJ Careers website is tricky if you have applied to positions with more than one email address. The password reset function does not seem to work properly.
The J&J recruitment process is fluid and friendly.  I don't identify at this time any improvement areas.
the introduction of more survey like this one
The interview is the most important step in the recruitment process.I think that the interview should be in this process addition to the forms filled in via your website.Since human relations is the substantial value in the sector we plan to occupy.Human relationships are as important as education and experience
"The internet site is not really user-friendly, especially the switch between english and french, and the general look and fill.

Regards"
"The initial process was simple and effective, however, 4 weeks after applying for the role I have been sent this survey and yet I have received no feedback on my application itself (positive or negative). I was very enthusiastic about the role but this experience has not been good or overly professional. A little disappointed in J&J."
The information can be shared in social media like facebook or Twittter
"The impression that I have received from the beginning of the job application is quite positive.
Kind Regards,
Erkut Goksel CINAR"
the hard working candidates are not talkative  
The grade 5 reflects the fact that I have not received any feedback pertaining to my application outcome.
"The following may be considered; 
1. State the specific deliverables of the position to the applicat applicant

2. State the quality specific goal of the applicant since the applicant is going to be part of a team that will embarking on a new strategic direction focused on championing and supporting people on the frontlines at the heart of delivering care. "
The first interview being done by someone with more than limited knowledge about the function and also disclosure of the salary range for the function.
"the filtering of the CV's. If the position require Managerial and technical skills, and the applicant process only one of them,  applicant may still be interviewed  "
The feedback process in the hiring process 
The feedback positive or negative is given (if given) too late ( &gt; 4 months after the application). 
"The existing process (system) is user friendly. Within the process, it would be great to introduce any feedback on the application progress within the process. So it would help the candidates to decide his/her progression. "
"The email sent for these surveys make it seem as if a person has gotten an offer. 
I celebrated before reading past the subject.

This should be included with the rejection email. 

Also the HR team should respond to their emails. I've sent a few asking to clarify duplicate job applications on the ""myJobs"" page. 

Also receiving a refusal and hour after you apply feels like you were not properly considered."
"The duration of response to application should be indication so that potential employee may know how long to wait. 

Up till date, there is still no response to my application. 

I do understand there are lots of application you are dealing with. Perhaps, there could be a better solution to this."
The discussion around the Package took more time than expected and the deadline right after is very short for the candidate.  It could be more balanced. The rest of the process is very well managed. 
"The description of the role is quite clear.
And asking for feedback is very creative.
Only the feedback I can say is the timeline of the process can be given.
Best regards
Tolga"
"The description of the candidate location in the posting:

Primary Location Europe/Middle East/Africa-Belgium-Antwerp-Beerse
Other Locations Europe/Middle East/Africa-Switzerland, Europe/Middle East/Africa-Belgium, Europe/Middle East/Africa-Ireland-Cork-Cork, Europe/Middle East/Africa-Netherlands-South Holland-Leiden, Europe/Middle East/Africa-Italy

Did no match with the questions in MyCareer, these were related with Ireland only."
"The description in the job posting was a very long description of the role, it confuses the applicant and because of the load of information you almost feel overwhelmed. A more precice, clear and short descition of the most important tasks, skills and competencies would draw a better picture of the role"
The current recruitment process is great.
The Current process of recruitment is intuitive and easily approachable by anyone who is interested in working for Johnson & Johnson.
"The current position of Medical Science Liaison in Haematology (in Lithuania) was announced in J&J carrier search webpage and in the several local recruitment webpages. 
I noticed the information about current position first in the local Lithuanian webpage, but applied directly via J&J recruitment system, which is simple and reliable and you immediately get confirmation.
I think there is some discrepancy between advertised position via local recruiters and J&J. Essentially, it is same the same Liaison position, but information provided at different webpages is slightly different. I think this should not be the case. I would suggest having the same information everywhere.
Also at the end of the day is not completely clear how these local recruiters are connected with J&J. Do they forward CV to J&J? Is this information stored at the J&J talent pool database too as is in the case with direct application? 
Some of the local recruiters do not announce that this is J&J position. That means potential employees might send two or several applications to the same position via different webpages. All sides will be happy to have something to read (actually almost the same information), but the net result it is also the same: it is filled in just one position. This might bring some confusion and unnecessary extra work for all sides.
It has to be more efficient.
"
"The content and title of the job announcement were completely different from each other. 
When looked at the content was like a tender speacialist. But in the title you ere looking for a assistant!!! 
There is the same problem in the province of Turkey in the career site. The title of the announcement is suitable for the tender specialist this time.
But when you see an authorized person after you apply to the province, they tell you that they are looking for a tender assistant.
You are looking for a lot of criteria to start a business, but you are giving an incorrect advertisement for an important position.Then you are wrong because you apply for that advertisement. 
"
"The computer-generated rejection letter was simply impersonal without providing any idea why someone would be accepted or rejected. It was received very quickly after submitting the job application, indicative of nobody looking at the application at all and only pressing a button on a computer at the end of the day.

However, receiving a quick response quickly directed my focus away from Johnson and Johnson company. "
The company should give an answer to their applicant even if the answer is negative. The applicant needs to know his position about the application.
The company is well  known in Switzerland and Europe. An additional language like German would be favorable.
The company could maybe provide a timeline for the candidates to know when they can expect the first feedback about their candidature and how long the recruitment process usually takes.
The communication with the applicant can be better organized.
"The careers site itself is difficult to navigate and did not make the application process as clear as other careers sites, e.g. P&G's site, do. Other than that the experience was fantastic and I would definitely re-apply in the future. "
The candidate shall be subjected to entire recruitment process
The black hole you are using is pretty anonymous. Impossible to get any valid feedback or have a discussion with the recruiter.
"The application website didn't work correct, very difficult to get an account "
The application process was simple and clear. 
the application process was quite easy.
"The application process was quite clear. I have not heard anything since then. However, I just noticed the job position is not available anymore. Therefore my question, is the position already filled in or has the screening phase just started ? 
If option 1, then an improvement could be to inform the sollicitators.
Thanks in advance, 
Regards
 "
The application process on the web site is very intuitive and it takes a very short time to do it.
"The application process is excellent if such a Large and reputed company like Johnson & johnson can diversify the job opportunities for international students like me, it would be ideal to start our career path in Europe."
The application page does not work properly every time and all the open positions can not be seen without beeing registered
the application is not realy designed to undersatnd the role
The answer to the application should not be long
"The annouce ment Washington clear, accusateur and Wellington described.
Italie may beaucoup necessary tout insist more on the wages. Différentiation the fixe wages and the variable"
The above Process looks good to me and you can add so technical questions regarding the job position.
"The ""Next step"" application was not kept up to date."
The  recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson is good because it mainly give trust and opportunity to young graduates.
"The  Johnson &Johnson online recruitment platform is quite effective means to recruitment and  information for potential applicants.
 However, this could be complimented with advertisement on local daily publications or online job site  especially in the countries where the job location is.."
"Thanks for your contact. I think that the process should have a personal contact in any moment. For knowing more about the profile of the candidate, e.g. Phone contact, technological contact (Skype), and others options.

Thanks!

"Thanks for the survey, I would love to give you some proper feedback regarding the recruitment process but to be honest I´m still in a very initial point on my application, I´ve just applied for the offer so everything is ok at the moment. "
Thanks for the great clear communication .
Thanks
Thank you Sjoerd for keeping the door open
"Thank you for your email about giving feedback. Distinctive. My compliments. My experience, my expertise and my (intrinsic) motivation for applying to the position of Strategic Account Manager @Janssen_Ned are of course the most important things to see if I'm the right candidate, the perfect match. For a first impression it is maybe an idea to have the possibility for candidates to upload also a photo on your website? 
Other ideas I would like to discuss during a personal conversation. I look forward to hear  from you :-)
Thanks and Kind Regards, Lia Bonnie"
"Thank you for this opportunity,
All they do from advertisement is well understood but would wish that for some that do not know internet well, it is not much easy for them to access the advertised position. My humble proposal is that, let the advert be easily accessible for the job hunters. I am indeed of the idea that the organization posts the adverts in social media, Linkedin and share with other links. However, for quality, I agree that a hunter should work hard to learn to know the potential employers like j &j. I am honored to be associated with Johnson and Johnson for it has been my long time dream employer."
"Thank you for the questionnaire. 

No idea ,as I've never been in further recruitment process in your company. I just submitted my CV on your Career page.

BR,

"Thank you for such opportunity,so far i am satisfied"
"Thank you for providing such a clear method of applying. I think closed loop communication and feedback on the reason for not choosing a candidate might be helpful. 

Thank you"
Thank u bec you are replying by e-mail but What is frustrating is when the application is rejected without providing any explanations . I really felt it is a fake job especially that my skills and competencies fit this role. Anyhow I have no regrets for applying and I am ready to apply for other positions in the future:)
"Test the candidates to match the right candidate who has the right qualifications, abilities and experiences for the current position"
Tell you when you will hear at the latest if you are invited for an interview
Tell us why JJ reject our application. It would be easier to improve  for the next application in the same company or another one.
Tell me why I didn't get the job. 
"Teh Feedback Loop about the Status of the application is either Hiddensee or I have not found it yet. als a candidates, I feel often lost in process."
"Te current process seems very clear to me. Personally, I would also introduce a ""FaceTime or skype"" section as ""optional"" at the point of application. Maybe a tad time consuming but sometimes, just sometimes a quality candidate may just not have the right cv... but passion & desire do not always come from a cv. 
I look forward to taking the next steps

Talk to their applicants. It is not always possible to include everything on the C.V. so good to always make that personal contact. 
Talk to the candidates
Talk to the candidate and inderstand his /her role
"Taleo platform as it is now could be more userfriendly. Especially when you use the ""apply now"" shortlink, it would be appreciated if the system would do a summary of your application or at least make the candidate aware that-withe next click to come- he or she will send the application. I am also wondering why  the possible number of applications was reduced to only for documents. I would love to enter a resume, a motivation letter and the most recent reference letters or most important qualificqtion certificates, which is not possible this way."
"Talent Acquisition Team were very good; however the two people conducting the interview were clearly not experienced interviewers.  One spent most of her time answering her emails, the other was clearly very good at her job but appeared to be looking for someone who could just step straight into her shoes as an exact copy of her.  Any experienced manager knows that this is not a possibility amongst any candidate.  TA confirmed the interviewers thought I would be a great fit for the company and team but I was not selected for next steps for making one mistake in the excel exam (which I quickly rectified) and because the interview took longer than they would have liked (I asked clarifying questions and for explanations).  

This was my second experience with JnJ - the first was at High Wycombe where the hiring manager was more concerned with staring out the window than listening.  It turns out the position had already been given to an internal candidate before my interview even began which meant he had intentionally wasted my time and his own.

Personally, as an experienced manager leading local and global teams I understand the importance of good hiring practices.  I prefer to talk with candidates in a relaxed more informal scenario as this dispels nervousness, aids relationship building and helps the candidate relax so they feel more comfortable to be honest.  Interviews I have held typically take 30-45 minutes but are booked for 60-75 minutes to ensure time is not an issue.  I focus on the attitude of a candidate as it is their personality, ability to fit into the team / culture, and their desire to learn, develop and improve; yes their skills are important but these will have to be remodelled to fit into a new environment anyway.  

In my opinion, neither interaction has left me with a remotely positive impression about JnJ or their affiliates, in fact rather a poor one, I shall not be applying for a third time.  "
"Talent Acquisition program is one of the most promising and successful programs practicing nowadays at large multinational organizations and J&J is one of the strongest units in that chain. My opinion on improvement is that J&J should be more open to international employees, let's say, sometimes it worth to go beyond the boundaries."
"Talent acquisition is a well thought and brilliant programm, heard about this via one of your employee. I could suggest to spread more on social media about the announcement, advertisement of this precise programm to reach wider areas and offcourse as a result, to have a huge data base. 
Sincerely, 
Ebru"

"Start using other recruiters instead of ONLY Stephan Zoebli. I wonder how he can handle all the resumes he receives. He even writes in each post that we can contact him for any doubts, and once we do it, he is everything BUT courteous. I guess is due to the amount of job he's got, and we all want to know exctly the same things, if we are going to be call, how long it will take the proces. We all applicants want that he remembers our name, so that he get to contact us. 
So an idea would be that he doesn't write the phrase, CONTACT ME if any inquiries, to remove his telephone number AND to have other recruiters instead of ONLY him. I am sure he doesnt even read all his emails so due to this fact, I dont trust your recruitment process at all. It might happen all because of contacts or luck that he opens up your resume.

I like the idea that you are checking Candidate's ""pulse"" during the process not at the end as this gives you an opportunity to correct any action needed.

"Recruitment is for sure an enormously complex process. And the bigger the company the harder the way to distinguish the best candidate. In my opinion everyone's attempt to recruit a candidate should focus more on his attitude than his skills. I see more and more that this principle is shifted by the need to go fast. And this is one of the the reasons because companies are often unable to keep loyal and good employees. A good recruitment process take very long time and care. But this is just my opinion, I think a lot of parameters are involved in the issue. 
Thanks"
Recruitment consultants should contact each candidate by phone in order to get a better understanding of the candidates skills and experience. I myself was not contacted and feel that the recruitment consultant did not understand my skills and experiences by going through my CV. I feel if contact was made the consultant could make a more informed decision.

Provide a call interview first.

Promt information about the current state of the application.
"Prompt response, keeping the incumbents updated of the recruitment process."
Professional and diligent way of recruitment.
"process was easy and simple, can't think of anything major that needs to be improved "
process was a little bit complicated. It is easy to understand that you want to collect all applications in the same pool. However it could be easier to understand.
Process to be faster 
Process takes too much time. It can be quicker. But it is very important to get a contact with every candidates who have needed skills.
"Process is in order, probably spontaneous feedback or immediate request to take up the survey upon completion of application for the available positions."
Proceed with an interview to known me better and better know my professional skills and competence.
"Probably, offering a quick answer and, of course, in case of rejecting the candidate, trying to give a real explanation of the reasons and avoiding the topical phrases."
Proactive feedback on process.
"Pro's:
- automated email confirming application
- 1st contact within a week is perfect especially in holiday period

So far everything went very well in a professional way and according to expectations."
"present recruitment process up to this step is fine,major companies following the same strategy for the initial screening,after this scenario am not sure what step or which strategy that you are going to implement,as a bulk of respective applications for a job vacancy you are getting,so this strategy is essential,in this scenario you can shortlist the right candidate for the right position,  "
Present process seems fine
Present  the  applicant with a decent reason of rejection.
Preliminary Skype interviews perhaps? 
"Pour moi le process de recrutement est correctement fait.
A ce jour je n'ai pas de ""proposition"" afin d'améliorer celui ci.

"Pour ma part, si dans le processus de recrutement est prévu un entretien collectif ce n'est, à mon avis, pas une bonne chose.

Post vacancies in more Job Portals.
Post on more sites for available vacancies
Post jobs when hiring is in the works. Meaning that as soon as the recruitment is done people are hired. This helps reduce second thoughts on the would be candidates.
Post Jobs on Linkedin for 3 days coupled to the posting on the company website.Traffic on Linkedin is very important and gives exposure to a big number of candidates.
Post job advert in various (additional) social media platforms.

"Please send a status or also rejection via mail, I have not heard back after replying 13th of March-until today, 8th of April. Many thanks for considering in future."
"Please rework your ""Tipps für Online-Bewerbung"", because they don't really correspond completely to the real process. There is mentioned about 2 files, that can be uploaded, but at the point, where I uploaded my Curriculum, there was no other Change to upload the second file.

Also the Topic ""on the last page you can correct or Change your Input"" is wrong. You can only Change and correct afterwards, when you receive the link to your Profile. This is Kind of misunderstanding.

"Personally I will not change my positive opinion about the credo and values of Johnson & Johnson as well as my interest for the company as one of the flag ships companies in the chemical industry. On the other hand I have to recognize to be disappointed when no recruiter contacts you to know the added value and experience  that moves a senior professional with more than 20 years of experience in senior roles to apply to the company.

Being aware about the work load of recruiters/HR department I would suggest as a more respectful and professional approach to have a short call to an applicant or to use a less impersonal e-mail rejecting the candidate using at least some objective reasons. "

"Perhaps you could perform a pro-active screening. For me personnally, I have indicated that I'm looking for a new job, but it's not really nice to receive a ""No"" every time you apply for a particular job. Most of the applications are out of my reach. It would be great if I would only receive applications with a ""fair"" chance to get the job.

Perhaps someone can give me un answer ( maybe yes or no) ???????
Perhaps proposed a job interview in order to know if the candidate is good  for the position.
Perhaps include more inside details of the company for applicant information.
"Perhaps a little more feedback to the applicant.  Apart from this survey I do not know how my application is going. Also, whilst I understand initial trawling to reduce applicants to a manageable list, a telephone call may be a way of getting some further data back from the applicants.

An improvement in my opinion would be additional notification emails, e.g. when the application has reached HR or the next stage. So far it is only possible to see that the submission was completed.

"Not in my case , but in case of my wife (Rosa Maria Sanabrias) she has applied for a nurse position and never got an answer back on her application. This is very unprofessional not even replying that her application has not been considered.

I would also like to know the factors by which my application was not considered and not only because there is someone else better. This I know but in which area is better will help me and/or in which area I am not good and do not satisfy the criterias"

No doubt that the company is one of the successful companies around the globe. Especially with the diversity of its products and success. I believe broadening the recruitment process is to broaden job posting across well known professional recruitment companies and LinkedIn including a feedback to the applicants in how they can collaborate and apply the company values.

"My view
1. Adopt current recruitment systems."
My personal opinion is that the communication emails are predefined templates 
"My Opinion everything was good  because every quastion and exercise was clear.
In my personal opinion every think was right ."
My only encounter with the company was when i applied for the job. There was no other interaction hence not in the position to evaluate the recruitment process
"My only comment about this is that I have applied for two roles Scrum Master and Software Developer. Even though it was for a position in the same Graduate Program, I don't know for which of the positions I have been selected, making it difficult to answer the more specific questions about the role.

 "
"My observation on the process is  that I do not believe the application is seriously reviewed. Application was sent in and within one hours the answer was already given. No fit. 

How can improve - give feedback and not a standard email. Give the opportunity that somebody can reach the department and ask reasons. This will help for the future. What is the impression it gives now.

It is all about communication and how a company is seen. 
You ask in one of the questions about Company reputation and Credo and Values. 
Another point is the auction system. Questionable if you find the best fit. It is only about $$ what I received as feedback.
I could guide you in re-improve your process. 

Regards
Paul

"My idea is to make recruitment meeting by Skype to shorten the recruitment process, especially when meeting is abroad."

Multi cultural environment should be adopted.
"Może dla wstępnie wyslekcjonowanych kandydatów test ze znajomości rynku, produktów oraz rozwiązanie kilku zadań."
Most roles within my area of expertise SC&L would require a similar skill set. As the Job title may not be definitive enough to suggest the seniority of the role a salary guide would ensure that any roles I applied to were at the appropriate level. 
Most of the role in Johnson & Johnson are being offered by recuiter while all roles should be offered by JNJ directly.Some roles are on contract basis while keeping in view of JNJ leading position in globe all positions should be offered on permanent basis.
"Most of all I'm wondering a lot that I have to take the survey, although never have gotten any feedback to my application. 
Up till now I don't know about the status, which is - after weeks - an absolutely No-Go.

more???
More user friendly website
More transparency and better feedback
More than perfect 
"More than once feedback was decided to take internal candidates ? Why advertise tole externally then? Why not consider senior alumni members as ""internal""
Get higher priorty ? 
Why J&J rarely hires white males over age if 50 whom are highly qualified ? No mention of this demographics , diversity -women talked about daily in J&J blogs , we've become the lost group . Anyways would be happy to speak with Sjeord on this topic it's a real fact in today's industry . Recruting has not changed and all the talk well is just that. No sour grapes just reality!

Mention approximate timelines for the interviewing and acceptance process. 
"Meeting schedule formality (interview was 3 times rescheduled with a very short notice), more prepared interviewer for the meeting (candidate name was not even clear)"
Meeting people with individual interview in order to increase the number of candidates and their own skills.

But thank you anyway and i wish you good luck ."
Me parece que todo el proceso es excelente
Maybee the career team can use self recorded  video of applicant to evaluate 
Maybe you need to give more applicants the chance for interview because it is more important that you personally see them to know them better if they really fit the job. Thank you so much
Maybe turn to online for most of the recuiting process and only leave two offline interviews: one via telephone with both HR and manager/team leader and only one face-to-face - the final interview where the offer is agreed.
"Maybe to state the questions more precisely ( to write more details) .
"
Maybe to communicate to the candidates not successful for the role to let them know about it. 
Maybe to be faster....
"Maybe some contact adresses would be good, if somebody has some questions about the job. "
Maybe recruit more people who have vast experience in there line of work? 
Maybe observe applicants in their current jobs to observe their strengths and skills.
Maybe mention why a candidate's profile was not retained.
Maybe little more details about job.
"Maybe is the recruitment prozess in Switzerland too international. Thats means, the talent acquisation is only in english, and not everybody in Switzerland speaks english."
"Maybe invite candidats like me to an interview , because I make part of those very implicated in work and fast learner.I consider that a cv don't tell how realy work a person or how manage a job, so this means lucky in the carieer area because there are a lot of persons wich have something to show in the professional attitude.
Thank you, Catalina Ildiko Petre."
"Maybe instead of posting a job or multiple jobs in one mixed titles: Hr Advisors/Generalists/Manager** (000019AN), you could make it simpler as HR advisor or HR Generalist or HR manager as I believe those are 3 different roles and involve different duties."
"Maybe give more details on local office, its structure and organization."
Maybe for unsuccessful applicants a training one on one going through their CV to improve information in it pertinant to role or roles and techniques and mock interviews to help get their points across.
Maybe explain what will be the process to get the job and how long will it take.
Maybe and answer with the status of the process.
Maybe an human contact with candidat.
Maybe add the location/post code of the office so that people can see how they plan to get to the job as the Wokingham office is difficult to access if you do not have a car.
Maybe a little attitudinal test linked with the position
"Maybe a feedback for the candidate could be appreciate , and a more intuitive application 
"
Maybe a easier application process. 
May start by calling interview to assess the simple and basic qualifications.
"May increase the Process itself ,because it takes so much time to give feedback for the candidates."
May if possible to consider the previously applied candidates for similar position to be invited for interview after get confirmation of their interest
May be some sort of response or feedback mechanism after every 3 weeks.
May be some questionnaires will help J&J to assess candidates.  
May be reduce the recruitment time.
"may be if the applying process be more simpler , as i have to fill a lot of data which already present in submitted resume "
may be emphasize more on targets with SMART goals
May be can have open day for interview 
Matching existing skills and potentiality with required jobs 
"Many problems in the website: 
1) An error ocurred on the website trying to update my profile and trying to upload a new resume. 
2) I don't receive in my email de new positions posted despite I have an alert. 
3) After my submission to the job I got an e-mail telling that I had been referred for the position by an employee from J&J, apperaing the employee name in blank (I think it was a mistake and I had not been referred by nobody). This is a copy-paste:""Congratulations - has suggested you'd be a great fit for Johnson & Johnson. "". Moreover on the email I was asked to apply for the position....something that I had already done (that created confussion....does it mean that J&J didn't get my application?)."
"Many employers focus on building large applicant pools and then hiring managers complain that they don’t have time to review all the resumes. You need ways of using predictive analytics to narrow the pool of applicants to those who really fit the environment, and then focus your selection strategies on them."

"Make that tomorrow one met to exchange on our mutual future and establish working groups to improve that this.
Best regards. "
Make sure to continue providing with feedback to candidates (both hired and not hired) about the rationales driving the recruitment decision 
"Make sure that every candidate goes through the same thing, no matter how far s/he makes it through the process. Every candidate should be asked the same questions during the interview. It’s okay to ask a personalized question, but if some candidates are being asked about their project management skills, and others aren’t, then this needs to be fixed. To reduce bias (like favoring a candidate through reference or who has worked with a certain company), use a hiring scorecard to make sure that education, experience, certifications, and training are accounted for with each candidate in a similar manner."
"Make sure that each person that applies gets feedback in a reasonable time. 
Its better to know that you are not selected as a valid candidate on the short notice instead of never getting an answer what often happens.

"Just the fact that you give a feedback, positive or negative, to each single application is an importat way to differentiate J&J from most part of  the companies. Knowing that for a while (3-4 months) you could keep the applications actively available for other opportunities it would be a plus."

Johnson&Johnson sales or product specialists can give feedback about employee from market.
Johnson&Johnson do everything to recruitment process was good. 
Johnson&Johnson can improve by giving a personal response to the application. So far I have not heard anything except that my application has been succesfully received.
"Johnson& Johnson could use psychological tests because sales is working on good relations with clients. Soft skills are necessary in the position of Przedstawiciel Handlowy.
"
Johnson and johnson responded immediately on the status of my application. I think the company should continue this and ensure that the company is monitoring the application and provide update to the applicant on the status. 
"Johnson and Johnson is a global leader in the medical and paramedical areas. I want to join teams to participate in the expansion of the Group; sharing the same human values, I want to use all my skills and my business performance to increase sales, to develop new strategies for development. anxious to succeed, I put open all my energy to learn, assimilate and understand the market in order to retain and deploy customer portfolio. my ability of persuasion and my seriousness and professionalism allow me to exceed my goals. Wishing to change the field of activity, I want to learn and sell medical and paramedical products."
"Johnson and Johnson has a good, clear and easy to follow process in place. "
Johnson and Johnson could give regulary an update concidering my application (status). 
Johnson and Johnson can improve by providing feedback to the applicants.
Johnson and Johnson are doing are great job.
"Johnson &Johnson is fantastic
"
Johnson &Johnson can conduct psychometric test
"Johnson & Jonhnson has greatly improved the process in recent years.
Now is approaching the ideal way."
"Johnson & Johnson: Need to specify from which country candidacy are they expecting when they role out job opportunities.

Every time J & J expect local candidates, so in that case job opportunities needs to be shared with local candidates only. 

It is very disappointing to see e-mails from J & J stating your candidacy cannot be considered despite having relevant experience."
"Johnson & johnson, one of the most successful pharmaceutical companies worldwide, and sure it implements the best recruitment process, one special note to be added to the process, to give attention to high talented employees even if they less experience than others, Future will be for talented people only."
Johnson & Johnson's recruitment process is quite perfect to my mind:)
"Johnson & Johnson should provide full support to the recruitment section and provide instant  alert for candidate , who  had applied for the job . Thanks for providing me a good response and waiting for the golden opportunity from your side ."
"Johnson & Johnson Should not use H.R. but meet the candidates.
Often meet people Allows to better assess Their capabilities"
"Johnson & Johnson should list down the exact required technical skills and experience and contact the prospective candidates by phone and do the first screening on the communication and presentation skills.
"
"Johnson & Johnson should include in the job posting some of empirical evidence of some of the research or innovative ideas that they have undertaken that helped to improve health and quality of life, I think this will help to increase to increase a pool of applicants and interest from other partners and stakeholders."
"Johnson & Johnson should improve in the Recruitment of people of color (Africa Origin) in Europe. 

Chances should be given to people (Africa Origin) to intergrate the Johnson & Johnson in Belgium. Eventhough, we have the right right skills and University degrees. Our applications to work for Johnson & Johnsons are usually turn down, without any reasons.

"
Johnson & Johnson should also used media such as linkedin to advertise posts.
"Johnson & Johnson recruitment team should be more attentive with the cv they received. I speak for my on words , I apply for different position and it is unbelievable how the check is done , how can it possible that have 7 year of experience in a Global company and speak 4 languages and at the end I doesn't fit in any position at Johnson & Johnson company. I believe the recruiters should have knowledge and experience of life and bring onboard experienced people instead of fresh people only with this company can achieved even better results."

Johnson & Johnson need to call me!
Johnson & Johnson must to improve the communication on the state of the application.
"Johnson & Johnson is showing an impressive recruitment process till now  by sending this survey in order to have a feedback on the application experience. 
I think that I should experience all the recruitment process in order to be able to suggest the things that should be done to improve it.
"
Johnson & Johnson is one of the best multinational organization. As till date I didn't appear for any position so it's very difficult to say something about the recruitment process.
"Johnson & Johnson is doing just great with regard to its recruitment process, though i believe  an increase in PUBLICITY and ADVERTISEMENT would go a long way in identifying more talented candidates."
"Johnson & Johnson is a well known company because of its high quality products. So, it has got an advantage to be noticed easily among the job advertisements of other companies. Even so, if you ait to make a difference on the recruiment process, I advice your team to focus on impaired people. For example, you can make a job offer video for the hearing-impaired people with a narrator using sign language or a job offer audio for the visually-impaired people. If you already did, I would just appreciate you."
"Johnson & Johnson is a well know brand and its recruitment process is fine, but there is always a chance of further improvements. It would be better if there would have been few more survey question, so that the applicant and company,  both can know each other in a better way. This is just a humble suggestion."
"Johnson & Johnson is a very big company, so i think that to improve recruitment You have to give a chance also to the people that do not have a lot of experience.
In this way you can improve your activity with new young strengths that can ensure loyalty to your company"
Johnson & Johnson is a great company and would be good if it could make effort to tap into local talent.
Johnson & Johnson highlights the fact that the company takes care of its trainees and tries to train them with the best methods. 
"Johnson & Johnson has a great standard in terms of recruitment process, but to add some thoughts, I think the process should more easy to search. Partnership to different job search website is more helpful for the job seekers."
Johnson & Johnson embodies the products. I think this is the right direction to success.
"johnson & johnson doesnt need anything to improve the recruitment process, its so credible and profesdionsl."
Johnson & Johnson could run a brief telephone interview following the display of the candidate's curriculum in order to get more details about the decision to call or not the candidate for an interview at its headquarter
"Johnson & Johnson can improve the recruitment process by following these points:-

1. Understand the Cost/Benefit of a New Employee Before You Hire 

2. Hire Employees that Thrive at Each Stage of a Startup 
Startups are a special situation when it comes to recruiting.You'll need the kind of people that can navigate a fast changing landscape with little oversight and guidance, and quickly learn new tasks as they become necessary.

3. Strengthen Your Employer Brand With Content Marketing 

4. Create an Office Space Millennials Want to Work In. 

5. Use Data to Optimize Your Hiring Time.
To help you gauge if you're getting the timing right, you'll want to start measuring your time to hire. From deciding you need a new employee to actually bringing them onboard, how long does it take?
Knowing this will help your company determine how much lead time you need for recruiting. 

6. Recruit Passive Candidates On Social Media

7. Make Video A Key Part Of Your Hiring Process.
Create a company culture video,Accept video applications and interviews,Save time and money with video interviews.

8.Involve Your Employees in the Hiring Process.
You have three opportunities to involve your employees in the hiring process.
•Your employees can recommend excellent candidates to your firm.
•They can assist you to review resumes and qualifications of potential candidates.
•They can help you interview people to assess their potential ""fit"" within your company.

9. using a pre-employment assessment test as part of the Hiring Process.

"Johnson & Johnson can improve the recruitment process adding the possibility for candidates of sending their spontaneous application.
"
"Johnson & Johnson can improve the recruitment process  by contacting the candidates who applied for the job, to tell them why they are not a good fit for the position. A contact even by email."
Johnson & Johnson can improve the communication and invitation of candidates. I only had a brief conversation with a recruiter on the Phone in which he stated that there is currently no vacancy. What I regret is that there was no (informal) conversation about the possibilities of working with J&J. And also I had no opportunity to display my personality and skills. In my opinion a conversation like this wil help the company and the client  to fill in the possible correct role within the company.
Johnson & Johnson can improve recruitment process by narrowing down to   potential applicants whose  meet the companies values ( credo)
"Johnson & Johnson can give to every candidate a feedback, even if they are not consider for the position. I believe that a feedback shows that the company cares about people that is looking for a job and can increase the admiration for the company."
Johnson & Johnson can give short information about interview topics and participants.
"Johnson & Johnson can do a personal test about the sales skills of candidate. For example, J&J can do a assessment test about the skills and put practical sales cases."
"Johnson & Jhonson has the most evolved and transparent recruitment process  in the pharmaceutical industry. The approach followed by J&J to get a right talent on board is very methodical and meticulous. Hence, no improvements required."
Johnson &  Johnson is having very nice online recruitment process.  All is fine with that.  
"Job offers could include a deadline or idea of starting date, to avoid applying for jobs that are already filled. There should also be an explanation about why an application was not accepted. "
Job descriptions are encouraged to be understandable / clear for people not within the J&J world :) avoiding intercompany abreviations and specifics. 
"Job description was not highly detailed. Could include more bullet points such as daily activities and list of required qualifications. IE: Business, IT, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering"
"Job applications via electronic devices (as like internet) are useful, but never replacing personally eye-contacts much better. We are not able to replace human senses via electronic to meet decisions "
"JNJ one of the big and strong reputation company.
But in the last days the accepted any candidate some of them not fit with skills and reputation in the market not good that will reflect on the company image so, I'm not agree with this point otherwise the Company is strong enough with good reputation.
Really I hope if I can join this company again will see the real figure in challah.
I was one of jnj family with Cordis team and now we shifted to cardinal health and I'm interested to rejoin jnj Company please.

JnJ has one of best recruitment process. I would rather fully agree with it.
"JNJ could provide the specific agreement (directive) on 18 months in role with no possibility of changing. Myself, as I'm 12 months in current role, I was hard-stopped by my superiors in moving on, stating this ""18 month rule"" - I've never seen in written and never signed the acceptance of it. It would be better if the company would be more transparent about it.

Thanks."
JnJ could keep candidates informed of their decision even in case of a negative response. Getting a feedback on an application is always valuable. I understand that this might not be possible for all applicants but maybe feasible for applicants with a certain degree of experience relative to the job they applied for.
JnJ could improve the feedback with the candidates.
JnJ can give information about the timeline of recruitment process.
Je suis une personne jeune dynamique et très motivée 
"Je suis motivé, consciencieux et prêt à élargir mes compétences au service de l'équipe.

                           
                     Mohamed Ben Hassen"
je suis dans le processus de recrutement et donc dans l'attente de votre réponse.
je pense que Johnson et Johnson devrait optimiser son délai de réponse.
"Je ne sais pas, car je n'ai pas encore eu l'occasion d'avoir un entretien avec votre entreprise."
"J'ai transmis ma candidature et je n'ai toujours pas de réponse de votre part . 

Quel est la suite du process de recrutement svp? 

"
J&J should view how other companies are doing the same process with their employees those who are with less efficiency than a same job grade J&J employee
J&J should try to respond to job applications once reviewed and decided not to continue with the selection.  
"J&J recruitment process is fantabulous. I Think 2 valuable factors are also essential to be considered in recruitment process if it's not there.
1- Hire for attitude 
2- Candidate passion for job 

Thank you"
J&J needs to open more position.
J&J may provide candidates with a better overview of the Group's corporate structure; as it is a very large organization and it is sometimes difficult to navigate through the various entities.
J&J is too focussed on hiring people who fit the right statistical profile.  Would be better off focussed on hiring people who wanted to work at J&J and improve the company
"J&J is a great company with a strong reputation, highly regarded all over the world. The duties description was quite precise, no problems with that. Based on the advertisement I understand that only a successful candidate gets a feedback from the company. However I think that it would be helpful for all applicants to have a response regardless of their application status, whether successful or not."
J&J has to give an answer fastlier to talents 
J&J has one of the most professional recruitment process in place that I have seen so far.
J&J has good system but I think that a face to face meeting (Formal Interview) is much batter then online recruitment because sometime peoples are unable to express themselves on online while they have good communication power in front of people (Specially those who are applying for sales and marketing). 
J&J has a magnificent recruitment process. 
"J&J get the value of Resume database for unsuccessful candidate  from prior application,  and if these resume not suitable again for the vacant position, then J&J to advertise for the position. where this gives the credit and trust that J&J care for the people even they were unsuccessful before. "
"J&J could think to permit a video record for each candidate. 
With a video, you could see the carism. 
On one paper, it's so reduce. "
"J&J can participate in the local events, introduce itself and it's products to the public, and get more familiar with the different cultures within the local community. Accordingly it can get better options and  be more precise in selecting it's future employees."
"J&j can improve the recruitment process by giving a (positive, I hope!) answer to my application! "
"J&J can improve its Communication with applicants. I Never received a withdrawl and actually on Taleo the application status is still ""active"". Nevertheless, I received this survey which makes me assume that the posting is not open anymore. Best regards and till soon"
"J&J can hire me.  Well, screening CVS as much as possible.  One wishes to know his profile has been viewed and then whether accepted or rejected, it's another matter."
J&J can give immediate feedback to their applicants.. after giving a thorough review of an applicants background...
"J&J can every chat in all languages to improve the recruitment process,  especially for the lower roles"
J&J can can publish the policies to general
"J&J already have one of the best processes that I have seen till now where it is upto date and has maximium exposure to the most popular recrutment channels, but I believe that there is some room of improvement in the response time."
J& J have best recruitment process compare to other companies.
J and j should reply to its applicants and consider their application instead of replying with automatic e mail without considering a profile
"I`d like to suggest to give more details about the role, for example  in terms of what type of channel will be used to support customers ( employees, managers and other human resource teams ). Will the contact be managed by phone, email, HR application?
What is the main HR tool ( Workday, SAP)?
Is the working time scheduled in shift?

Thank you"
It´s good. I can´t see anything wrong.
its ok
Its just best ! Cheers ! Hope to be part of your org someday !
Its good and clear it is always good to interview a such people who have good practical experience and the one who can speak concern points about product..off course johnson and johnson is a one of the best companies
Its already better but during selection do check candidates via skype interview or group call interview at preselection stage to get the best fit out of all
"Its a nicely streamlined process, however the selection process can be more job driven and specific for the role."
"Its a great system you are doing, but It would be much better if you always respond to the candidates if their application rejected. with a reason.
Thank you."
it's very ok.
"It's too early to say. Application process went smoothly , initial HR contact made (it shows that there's a human being on the other side, felt noticed). I hope I will have more to say in couple of weeks."
it's too early to say what should be improved. The application was intuitive and user friendly so at this stage no improvements have been noted. 
"It's the first time that a questionnaire has to be completed in the process. I think this is an easy way to check the engagement of a candidate.

I have not yet had feedback on my application so I am curious if it is going to be personalized or not. Honest personalized feedback of a recruiter would be a major step to motivate an applicant reach out a next time.
"
It's perfect!
it's perfect
It's ON the right way
"It's ok. 
Thanks. "
It's OK
"It's my first time to apply for any job in Johnson & Johnson so I'm not completely aware of the recruitment process. In general, I think if companies start telling candidates who have been rejected, then it would be a great step. "
It's innovative process for looking the best overall candidate submitted your application so good for you and keep it up 
"It's important that the recruitment process was friendly, professional and less stressful."
It's fine like this. 
"It's fair enough, however speeding up Interview process will reflect positively on the business ."
It's difficult to say something about someone without meeting him in person. 
"It's currently a nice online application process. However, probably there could be more categories for the vacancies, eg. for starters, professionals, or, classified according to background....eg. chemistry, medical, mechanics...."
It's clear enough. 
it's a very clear process and it has not taken to much time to apply. 
"It's a shame for a big company like Johnson & Johnson to post an advertisement for job opportunity that has been already filled. I'm so disappointed.
Making fake HR posts and interviews (for audits & compliance purposes) are absolutely unethical. waste of peoples' time and efforts.
Thanks,

"It's a really easy and pleasant process. So I don't know, right now, how you could improvisé your process."
It'll be highly appreciated if Johnson & Johnson could also let the candidate know the status their application alongwith the application experience survey request.
"It'd better be less automatical, more humanly."
It'd be very interesting to improve the feedback and communication with the possibles candidates during recruitment process.
"It would be very nice to receive the decision concerning my candidature in 1 month after the application, preferably not much later.
And in case of the negative decision, I would be very grateful to get more detailed explanation what exactly my application is lacking for this certain position."
"It would be very helpful to have the contact details of the responsible recruiter in order to be able to ask further position specific questions in case of uncertainties.
Possibility to upload larger files (5MB) would also be very nice."
It would be valuable to give candidates some information about the status of the candidature. Thank you. 
It would be really appreciated if the reason for rejection of the candidate application is specified in the mail response from J&J as this would give the candidate an opportunity to understand what has gone missing and therefore be able to prepare for the next opportunity.
It would be really appreciated if J&J could answer to job applications
It would be nice to notify an applicant who didn't  get the desired position that their application stays in the recruitment system for a future role that they may later be a better fit for
It would be nice to know earlier if you are invited to a job interview or not
It would be nice to have some feedback / an update on my application
"It would be nice to have response earlier, no matter if it's positive or negative.

Thank you for considering my application."
It would be nice to have face to face interview instead of over the phone.
"It would be nice to get some sort of indication that my application is not going into an untouched / un-reviewed box of resumes.This will help to ensure that I am not deterred from applying to J&J in the future even if I don't get an interview for this position.

Will J&J send a notification even if I am not considered for the role?"
It would be nice to get a feedback of candidacy
It would be nice if applicants could be informed about the recruitment process or deadline. 
It would be interesting to organize a day of collective recruitment followed by a scenario in order to project itself in the mission entrusted to it.
It would be interesting to acelerate the recuiting process.
"It would be important the chose of the external agency for assessment 
"
"It would be ideal to get feedback with specific explanations, why not take on this position and suggestions for the other positions in the company"
It would be helpful to receive a phone call/email with some personalized  feedback as to why the application was not progressed further. I genuinely feel that if I had the opportunity to speak with someone directly about the role I would be in a strong position. 
It would be helpful to receive a feedback after a rejection. 
It would be helpful to know the deadline of the shortlisting process.
It would be helpful if the hiring team could disclose  during the application process on whether the company would assist with obtaining work visa for overseas applicants or if they would entertain applicants who are willing to obtain their own work permit if they were to be shortlisted or chosen for a position.
"It would be great to see ,,Easy Apply'' possibility via Linkedin"
It would be great to receive a response sooner. It took over a month to get an input. 
"It would be great to know a bit of explanation, a sentence or so, why you were not shortlisted. Or in the description it would be better to see more requirements details to know for sure if you could be considered or not. Additionally, transferable skills are of great asset and to my mind should be taken into consideration, not only the particularly worded required skills and qualifications, otherwise, you are loosing highly suitable specialists through your net and make them not to apply again. Rightly used buzz words are not the sign of possessing the right skills and experience."
It would be great to indicate whether the job opening considers applicants from other J&J locations or would strictly consider only applicants in the same location where the job has been advertised. 
It would be Great to have the opportunity to join an application letter to argue our motivations.
It would be great to feedback that even if unsuccessful and a contact number to contact as I would have enquired what would I need to do to make considered for next opportunity. Regards 
It would be great to be notified regarding if a candidate is not successful in an application process. 
"It would be great if there would be named a contact person in case of any questions and not only the ""apply"" button. "
"It would be great if the first scanning process beginning at least with phone interview as I believe that I'm so much more than a CV. But also I know this may be more costly and take more time.
  "
It would be great if the Company gives feedbacks to all applicants
It would be great if the company gave a chance to young professionals who really want to work in Johnson & Johnson very much. Thank you. 
"It would be great if talent acquisition team proactively interview pool of candidates,  those who are interested to join J&J as an external  talent pool "
It would be great if Johnson &Johnson could provide faster response to the candidates in the recruitment process
It would be great if all stages of recruitment process are stated in job description.
It would be grate to receive a faster response whether positive or not.
It would be good to receive an alert to our email when a change was made in our application process.
"It would be good to provide opportunities across may media and forums, this will help to attract diverse talent and skill"
"It would be good to know why do you reject someone's application.
For example I had been rejected, and I don't believe you will have stronger candidates on local level in Serbia. Main reason I had applied was relocation from UK to Serbia. It would be good to know why someone with CV as mines is rejected for a average job in Serbia.

Your sincerely

Dan Folic  "
It would be good to have quicker updates on the application process as other than the original automated email and todays email for the survey I have not heard anything. 
It would be good to have more information on why I was rejected. A standard single one-liner is at odds with J&J reputation. I have also applied for three roles in the last year and never given the chance to speak to anyone. Thanks.
It would be good to have feedback on the reason why your candidacy was not retained especially after having a face to face interview. 
It would be good to get a feedback after sending CV
"It would be good if you could reduce the processing time, so that one doesn't have to eagerly wait for long."
It would be good if the applicants gets response quicker which makes the applicant better off applying for other vacancies 
It would be favorable if Johnson&Johnson would organise presentation seminars.
It would be easier if candidates could apply without creating an account
It would be better to have receipt approval for CV after application. 
"It would be better to differentiate the recruiment process from country to country, in Italy, for example, we usually don't ask 3,4 letters of presentation from previous workplaces."
It would be better if the revision preocess of candidates is faster. I still have not received a response regarding my application.
It would be better if the recruiters gave more information during the process. 
"It would be better if HR team could give an explanation of my resume refusal. I consider myself as a professional and specialist of high grade. 
Thank you for your time. "
It would be better and risk-free for human resources to contact with the candidates not only by e-mail but also by phone. There is a possibility to overlook the invitation because of the junk e-mails. 
It would be appreciated to receive feedback regarding status of recruitment process. I have received survey request but still not sure if the process is closed or open.
"It would be appreciated if your not-chosen candidates would be informed.
Thank you for the questioner"
It would be appreciated if I receive any information about my application. br Dariusz
"It would be a more productive thing to integrate a link dedicated to careers , where also a page is used for opening applications."
"It would be a great assistance, if Johnson and Johnson could provide additional information of the recruitment process:

It will be nice if the HR manager give reason for not choosing you for a position.

It was very well organized and clear what was expected of us. We got a lot of information by email/phone call. Therefore I have no further remarks on the recruitment process.
It was very proffessional that J&J sent an emial about delay in the recuitment procedures. it made me feeling that i am respected by the company. i hope i will soon receive confirmation whether my application was rejected or accepted for next recruitent steps.
"it was very efficient 
i would have loved to receive feedback with acceptance or decline the job after performing the interviews"
It was very clearly and understandably. The process shows how professional the company is. This is the major factor why i want to work for Johnson & Johnson.
It was very clear and straight forward. It is just not clear if it is a disadvantage if you do not fill out everything perfectly as it is written already in your CV (like the additional skills). 
It was some time ago that u applied do i would say more feedback would help. 
It was quick and smooth process till now. However I am still waiting for confirmation on my appointment. May be this survey should be shared after recruitment process completion rather than during the process.
It was perfect
"It was one of the smoothest processes I've seen in recent weeks. Easy to attach documents, use of Dropbox, etc."
it was an overall great experience with timely feedback on succession of interview…the interview process was fair and equal 
"It was a very impersonal experience and I felt processed, at no time was there a personal touch.  I would have liked to be able to clarify some points prior to applying but that was not possible.  I've also not been given feedback on why I was unsuccessful.   This was after being referred by long standing and senior employee of the company.  Shame really. "
It was a pleasant experience.
It should ensure the opportunity to view live the job application status
It should describe more in detail the activities of the prospective applicant.
It should be possible to attache more application documents
It seems to fit the purpose... 
It seems to be a slow enough process maybe due to the volume of applications. Otherwise the software is very well set up and easy to navigate.
"It seems perfectly adequate. 
Maybe there could be an online assistant to answer any queries or guide you through the application process?"
"It seems fine this way. As the question states the process is intuitive and easy to follow, the roles list is clear and the competencies needed are clearly stated."
It seems complete and clear. Of course the actual profile duties sometime deviate from real ones but also that is part of the required flexibility to reach the company targets!
It s good enough
"It might be nice if in your automated letter, it describes the process and not just that the application is in the system.  It really sounds like my application is in the ""big black hole"".  If you mention 2 to 3 steps of your recruiting process, I think it gives the candidate something to look forward to.

Thanks."
It might be better to make a phone interview before taking decisions to not furter pursue the candidate application 
It may minimize the recruitment process timing
"It is very strong process but generally speaking, because I have been also the requester for recruitment processes in my dpt, to speed up it."
It is very strange to apply for a job not receiving any feedback but beeing asked to fill out a survey! I would appreciate to first get a feedback about my application and then beeing asked to fill out a survey... 
"It is the first time for me to apply for Johnson & Johnson,and I can say from my first experience that the recruitment process (applying for a job advertised on Linkedin) is the standard application process. I received an auto email confirmation that the process was completed successfully after I submitted my CV on company website. 
The job advertisement includes all necessary information, it is exciting and encouraging the candidates, which is important factor in recruitment process.
Overall, I have a favorable experience so far at this stage. I believe that Johnson & Johnson follows and promotes the highest ethical standards in business, and my experience will be unforgettable.

Sincerely,

it is strange to receive a survey prior to job application evaluation...
"it is still too early in the selection process to say. Until now, I have not received any feedback and no step futher than the application online has been taken."
It is quit good comparing to others
"It is one of the greatest companies I have aspired to honor and work to improve my skills and develop my abilities with them. And improve the field of employment and advancement comes through the expansion of social media and the search for the best possible potential for the development of jobs you have.
And you are fine"
It is one of the best recruitment process on the matter of time and communication. The technique used for interview is easy to follow and advanced. 
It is Ok.
It is OK
"It is not so easy to recommend steps for improvement of the J&J´s recruitment process for me without knowledge of internal environment. I can see brand of J&J in prostor of social media or in internet prostor generaly, which is now probably the most efficient way to be seen. If your recruitment process is or is not efficient can be measured probably only via view how easy you are able to atract potential new employees. :)  "
"It is not possible to upload more than four documents and they are the same for all my applications. It could be better if it is possible to upload a different document for each of the applications, especially for the cover letter to be personalised to the offer. "
"It is not clear when you have to inform your current manager about your application elsewhere. From the information provided by the application system I concluded that I had to inform my current manager as soon as when I pushed the ""Send"" button in the application system. I had my first interview 3 weeks later and meanwhile, the information that I was applying elsewhere was spread out to people who shouldn't know about it.
Later, during my interview with the talent acquisition manager I learned that you only have to inform your current manager about your application when you are invited for an interview. This was not clear to me and because I informed my manager 3 weeks before the interview, my application could leak to other colleagues. Likely, this was not or less the case when it was clear that informing your manager does not need to be as soon as you send your application. "
"It is not bad but could be improved through better integration with Job Search Engines. That will make online application easier and could be done directly through applicant profile on Job Search Engines or LinkedIn.

It is my opinion that the recruitment process is very well structured. 
"It is my opinion that Johnson & Johnson has always been to cutting-edge, compared to its competitors, And this and this survey, it shows. "
It is impossible to go back and change something once we submit our application 
It is important to return back to the candidate with the results of his application 
It is important that employees value their experience
It is good Enough
It is fine as it is now
It is fair. No need for improvement
"It is disappointing to have taken time to go through the process and get a rejection 30 minutes later! Also, no feedback. Having applied for roles previously and despite having relevant skills to not get past the first stage without explanation as to why does not encourage further applications, even if your skill set has changed and you do think you are a total match "
it is better to make recruitment process faster 
It is an elaborate process but the major benefit is that in the end you can make a well balanced decision. 
It IS ALWAYS SOMETHING FOR ENHANCED
It is alright the way it is now.
It is a very good company to work.
it is a international company 
"It is a good reliable process because of the extra input questions at the registration.
They give you a better perpective on the inside of the job."
It is a good recruitment process.
It is / was good.....
It is  good 
"It improves my experience, professionalism, all my current skills, it keeps me more business oriented, it provides their employees with a high level of training that related to each position, the school of Johnson & Johnson everyone looking for one of its family."
It has to be decided by the Human Recourse team and what ever the questions    has been asked its good and by that HR can take a note and go further for other farmalities i would like to hear from the concerned ASAP.
It has been noticed that the candidates from the third countries / under developing countries are not being selected although those candidates has strong profile and experiences then the developed countries candidates.
"It has been excellent so far. As it's on the way (I have participated in 3 interviews), I hope to have also feedback.
Thank you! "
"It has been almost one week, since I sent a CV into your company and unitl today nobody has contated me (positive or negative feedback). This is quite strange, even when you ask me to fill the survey. :-)
To improve your recruitment process I recommend to speed up the communication with candidates. Generaly it is a problem with a good candidates on labor market, so it will be shame to let them go to another companies only because they haven't received any reaction from J&J side (except of auto reply from applying system)."
It has a good recuitment process already. It could show the desirable start date for each position.
"It goes long until an answer comes even if it is a cancellation. Everything is very impersonal (standardset), think the dossiers are never properly viewed by professionals "
It gives more opportunities of job to graduates who didn't continue their studies at university.
It depends if HR can screen and select the suitable elements to exploit them for right formulation and successful implementation of the products to evaluate and achieve Johnson & Johnson goals and values. 
"It could take a better look not only on the professional experience , as well as the candidates ethical opinions and social interaction . Sometimes you lern more from personal experience and self development. 
"
It could have been interesting to receive a feedback on why the application was not considered
It could be quicker having the possibility to just load the CV and the cover letter. 
"It could be interesting that in addition to the job posting the company could add a short time video on linkedin or on monster where the manager responsible of that department can explain directly which is the right colleague  they're looking for. In the same time some pictures of the supply chain or of the operations could scroll on the web and this could enable the candidate to start feeling familiar with the environment of the new "" desired "" job and maybe the Interview could be more interesting for both of them."
"It could be better if we could apply at different offers in a same sector (such as product manager) at the same time, without go back to all the recruitment process. When we really want to enter in a company, sometimes, it's necessary to apply to different offers to raise the opportunity ! "
It could be a little faster. 
it could be a good idea to send candidates a brief feedback about their (lack of) convenience related to the job
"It could ask The candidate for a presentation letter, written by a university professor or a collegue within a previous working experience. "
It can organizes and evaluates training workshops
It can improve the feedback process to be more techinique 
"It can be naive, but I think it makes sense to keep in touch regularly with a select group of potential candidates.
This is because the number of candidates for each selection is huge (I had experience as a recruiter in the past ...) and new technologies require complex skills and competencies in the work.
That is why I believe candidates like me (of course I'm involved in this proposal!) could be a reserve ready to provide an effective support in short time "
It can be indicated in job posting if candidates without job permit of the location of the job opportunity are acceptable or not.
"It all seems like going in the right direction. I hope to get an answer hopefully positive, and just judging someone by the CV is insufficient. If the CV has some values before eliminating the person it is still valuable to see the person on the Skype once.
Thank you"
It all depends on J&J internal regulations
Is to reduce the time to make a personal interview.
"Is simple and easy, nothing to improve"
Invite potential candidates for an interview 
invite more people for interview.....   you are missing out on the good people.
"Invite me, hear me, give a face to face impression."
Invite me for an interview.
Invitation for an job interview or assessment center.
invitation for an job interview or assessment center
invest time in face-to-face communication with suitable candidates. Interpersonal communication will tell a lot more about a person; especially when it comes to communications positions within the company.
"Intially the HR team was very proactive and kept the things well informed, however when i asked for a clarification on flexibiltiy in deciding the work location they didnt turned back and i dont know whether my profile is still under consideration or not."
Interviewing the candidates; defining the reasons adopted for making the favourable/unfavourable choice.
"Interviewing the candidates will be a good step especially the CV is not giving full insight on the competencies & capabilities of each one. Thanks for considering this suggestion in your further positions.
Thanks again.
Regards, Ismail"
"Interviewing groups. This is an opportunity for the candidates to work as a team. This step is interesting for the HR to analyse better the candidates in a practical way. How they can solve problems, how they sale their ideas and  how they work in a team."
internal candidates should receive feedback from the recruiters about the process and next steps. 
"Interact discussion with candidate about position , not only email with sorry we have not interest ( for me it is important why ) , especially I worked in JJ 14 years and I would like return back as senior manager with more technical and sales background from Medtronic, Surgical Intuitive , Hologic etc. Iam no talent for development strategies around the world with JJ once again ? I hope that  wiil any small chance to reach such chance in short future.

"Integration of Linkedin profile to fill in your forms. 
HR to call candidate to screen applicants.
I feel that often HR seems to neglect relevant domain experience and just looking for keywords set by hiring manager."
"Instead of an indirect email response, a local personal phone call would be more  benefiting to the applicatent.I realise the organisation would get plenty of resumes from people, but the personal touch which is a part of your Credo statement (know of this from previous work experience in 2005) would give a 2 way communication process of why the person's job application was successful/unsuccessful.
Hoping I may be a part of the J & J family in the near future and help build the company even stronger.

"In this case, it 's hard to say, since for the right answer one should know the methods, rules and internal worldview of people making decisions about employment. But it seems to me that hiring people is engaged in the recruits, developed regular programs and launched them. The candidate is asked to answer questions by putting a cross or a not. Next, according to the table, the result is calculated and voila  ... the candidate is ready. And of course, always striking the demands that are made on the candidate. But in fact, his work will be significantly different from what written in the sentence. "
In the tool you were asked to answer the question about working in the US several times. I would ask the question once. 
In the same way Johnson & Johnson can improve more when it comes to it's receuitment process by more exposure to social media links and on-line career portals. 
"In the position description, I couldn't see in which department (therapeutic area) this position is open. It can be added to be more clear in the description part."
"In the email that you sent me to take this survey, the subject line said ""William, we'd like to hear from you.""  Initially the message made me feel like you were reaching back out to me for a possible interview. Needless to say it was disappointing. I would suggest you change the wording in the subject field so no one else will have the same feeling about it. "
"In terms of online system used to fill the application, it seems that the process is user friendly which attracts the candidates from a junior level to an executive one.

As for the internal process, i don't have an idea about how usually the pre-screening, screening, approaching/headhunting, interviewing process is going on internally so i can't give any recommendation"
"In order to get the job, I had 7 interviews... After 15 years within the company, it is maybe too much."
In my view recruitment process is exhaustive and very well planned that gives a good insight of the interviewee
"In my suggestion, coordinating job fairs or conduct job fair in various region can  help to find right people"
"In my point view, the web based advertising for products with high levels of quality. It would be helpful to increase the patient compliance. "
"In my point of view it is not always necessary that the employment process to be based on candidates experience  only but also, to discover the candidate passion & personal skills. There is a scale of both knowledge and experience needed that the recruiter should not by any mean go below. So, a balance between experience and candidate skills is very appreciated."
In my point of view doesn´t need any improvement
"In my personal point of view, J&J could improve the recruitment process by giving earlier updates on the process while the submissions are open, mainly the deadline for appliance on the job offer."
"In my own opinion, more communication would be an asset on your side. I still have not heard about you concerning my application"
"In my opinoin, creating an account and able to see the current vacancies and make a desicion with seeing what is the consept of the job and which skill do we need to have is an effective method. During the process some desired question may have been asked to condidates to determine whom is the most suitable to the position."
"In my opinion, you can improve the process by introducing a quick and prompt correspondence for rejected candidates. 

"
"In my opinion, there's no need for improvement."
"In my opinion, the recruitment process is very clear and easy explained, what I like. Especially for young graduate positions it might be beneficial, if there were more possible answer-levels for the question about the working experiences to receive a more accurate answer of the applicant."
"In my opinion, the recruitment process in Johnson & Johnson is extends in a unique way which makes it is very interesting and engaging. I'm not sure if you can still improve the recruitment process."
"In my opinion, the process works really well!"
"In my opinion, the desciprion of the position was pretty clear but it may include little more about growth and development of the incidated positions of prospective candidate."
"In my opinion, the company should show how they care about employees, this always improves the impact on applicants.
Cheers"
"In my opinion, tasks description sounds too technical skills oriented: which is too restrictive with regards to the ""innovation process"". Ideation and design thinking as key pillars of innovation are empowered by people soft skills, not expressed through an automated application process.
 
Please have a look to innovation communities, and the people profile who belong to.
"
"In my opinion, It would be interesting to know the skills and abilities that Johnson & Johnson are looking for in the selection process.

"
"In my opinion, i have found the application process very easy and well structured. I don't advise any improvements to the existing application form."
"In my opinion, I am satisfied with the detailed and clear description of roles, the skills, and the competencies required for each job role, as well as the prompt response to candidates regarding the status of their applications.

In the case of not being selected, not only that the candidate is encouraged to not loose hope, explanations were also provided as to why the candidate was not selected. "
"In my opinion, CV can't describe 10 years of experience. So I may suggest to increase the number of screening interviews in some cases so that to catch up with the best fit candidates."
In my opinion to improve the recruitment process Johnson & Johnson have to find young people that they able to contribute to the Plant grow up
In my opinion the way to carry out the selection process is correct
"In my opinion the recruitment process doesn't consist in only oral interview but the promising candidate must put to work directly. In addition  in the recruitment 
 there is a very psychological impact for candidate, who myself, doesn't sustain an interview before, but it is the system to consider the real candidate's character because it is impossible to make the answers."
"In my opinion the process was good
 but may be need some improvement in the system as i didn't receive a job alert email for this new opening position, while i already applied for another job before and as i understand my data and profile are saved for more fitting job opening in the future ."
"In my opinion the online application tool could be a bit easier. 
More straight ways."
In my opinion the application process has been well structured.
"In my opinion the aplication process would improve for the candidate if it could be completed through linkedin. it would be quicker an easyer. 

 "
In my opinion the answer time if I fit or not to a Johnson & Johnson' role is too long.
In my opinion recruitment process so far is well prepared. You can only add time windows to ensure camdidate that he will have a reply in for example 10 days. 
"In my opinion nothing, all clear"
In my opinion maybe have more job agencies involved in recruitment. 
In my opinion Johnson & Johnson is doing very well in regards to recruitmentprocess
In my opinion it be useful for the candidates to know if they are chosen to take part of the process after having applied to the role through your website because it is quite frustrating to wait until you see that the compact has not count on you. You can differenciate yourself as a company with just sending one email more
in my opinion can improve to face to face meetings. 
In my opinion - nothing. On the other hand I don't know the whole process...
"In my opinion , if it also matches with your data collection policies and structure ; The job applications could be accepted directly from Job Sites. This would make the application process more easier to applicants and they can save time. 

From J&J side ;you can easily access some additional details of the applicant which you do not able to aquire even in the job interwies."
"ın my opinion
they should give chance to people working in a local company like me.
"
"In my modest opinion.
It would be nice, to know how you are going in the process.
Simplify interviews, bringing together various departments.
"
In my experience I didn't feel my application was fully acknowledged or considered due to the level of experience On my CV. I only graduated a year and a half ago but have a lot of experience in marketing and data despite this yet I think my application was rejected in terms of how much experience I had in total rather than how much I've done in a short period of time. I think this could mean you miss out on grads with a lot of potential and drive.
"In my case, I can say that on this job listing I was/am fit to have at least an face to face interview. I have experience in retail and in the pharmaceutical field and having previous experience as a National Account Manager and working towards my ABPI certification, I thought this would be the dream job. 

I need a proper feedback ( which on the last ocasion I did not receive it as well and it was face to face interview) and  having a previous face to face interview with this company I thought that was the problem not going forward with the process. The previous job I did not accept it  because it was a short term contract and I want stability which this company can provide. "
"In my case this was the best way of the recruitment process. I can just tell what other companies do different: 
- the candidate is interviewed first by the Recruitment Officer and then by all the ierarchic superiors, including Regional Manager, Business Unit Manager, National Sales Manager (if this isn't the same as BUM) and Human Resources Director. After this, right before receiving the Salary Offer, the candidate takes a Personality Survey online. All these steps bring a better selection of the future employees, and a lower chance to mismatch the employee with his job. "
"in middle east , there were no diversification in nationality "" Egyptian only ""  , and actually no one know the criteria of selection as since 2 years i am applying for positions in J&J even they didn't ask for one to one interview .
I am interested to be one of J&J family as i have  experience in middle east for both pharmaceutical and FMCG line , 
Just if you send why the refuse my application so we could know if we can apply for next time or not.   "
"In mi opinion, can be a great idea try or speak with another cain of candidates.
For example, I'm a good worker and a good comercial but I send cars and for me I'ts very dificult to have an oportunity in the health world. I'm sure that you can find a very intersting people if you open some posibilitys to another professionals.
"
"IN general Johnson & Johnson with its reputation of an employer giving fair opportunity to employees, should be transparent in their assessment to applicants by highlighting the skill gaps, in case they reject them at the phase of screening of their CVs."
"In future, put a human face to the process - in addition to the automated process."
"In fact the recruitment process in Johnson & Johnson is well arranged and organized. And the other companies should learn from you. I have the following suggestion to improve the recruitment process: Manage Candidates relationships by staying in touch with candidates and building relationships with them over time which can help improving the recruitment process and build a network of contacts for future positions. It also can save money on sourcing.
Thank You.
Best Regards."
"In fact I submitted three applications for job openings at J&J career website but unfortunately I didn't receive any written or verbal communication that clearly show if I will be considered for further steps or not. I think clear and transparent communication is key factor to foster the recruitment process.

Thanks!
Ahmad"
"In case candidacy was rejected. I was very pleased by received the feedback so at least I know from do I stand from the application I had made, however I think it would be great if reason of rejection is added. Maybe I am not fit to any opening you might have, how will I know?"
"In addition to the vision of the curriculum vitae, to consider and to test practical skills in performing activities of competence.

If you submit your application process you can´t go back. So I missed to upload my job references.

I'm a bit dissapointed that J&J fails to put a clear description on the recruitment timeline, or follow up more closely with their potential candidates."
"I'm yet in the middle layer of the process the way that I need to proceed more to see the full image of it.
But, keeping the applicant updated by his current level is highly considered by my side."
I'm sure the recruitment process in the company occurs at a high level.
I'm still in the beginning of the process so at this point I don't have any answer.
I'm still awaiting an answer if I'm successful for interview so hard to say at this point
"I'm not sure whether Johnson & Johnson informs the applicants if they pass or not to the next round. 
Some companies only send emails in case an applicant moves forward on the application process. However, it's always useful to get some feedback on the reasons that excluded you from continuing, so that you can improve them somehow in a next opportunity. Being informed about your status is also useful, otherwise people keep waiting for a reply, when in fact they were already excluded from the process. 
"
"I'm not sure if my candidacy was accepted or refused. Maybe some sort of feedback within two weeks would be nice, even if it would be a refusal."
"I'm not expert in HR processes 
But I think an IQ test will let the recruitment team choose a talented candidate "
"I'm convinced that Johnson&Johnson is caring for the health of people all around the world. For this reason, Johnson&Johnson should try to bring ideas, experiences and innovation from people from all over the world : Employing people from Africa, Asia or latin America will help to improve products and services to life to advance the health and well-being of people around the world. This is the mean of collaboration.
Kind regards."
I'd wish for a personal contact for any questions.
I'd reduce the steps trying to simplify even more the application process
I'd need to proceed to further steps of application in order to provide valuable insight on that.
"I'd like to recive a personal feedback about the interview, also in case of the hiring team has chosen not to pursue my candidacy."
"I'd like to hear,if possible, the reasons that have excluded my profile from selection."
I'd like to have a feedback  if my application are not considered 
I wouldn't change. It was all clear to me. 
"I would suggest to provide a summary sheet at the end of the application process in order to review the data provided before submitting the application. 
Furthermore I expect to receive a clear and candid feedback in case I will not be selected."
I would suggest direct contact either by telephone or email for example I applied for this role two months ago and I have not heard if my application has been successful yet.......
I would suggest better website with more focus on UX. The website is very old and not really clear in certain steps.
"i would suggest  a inducction process to the company, this can help to know the skills and capability the new worker"
I would recommend utilising less computer generated feedback to remove applications received and utilised a more thinking out of the box tools to gain a less domesticated workforce 
"I would recommend that you have a more defined feedback loop processs fir applicants. 

Having applied for the role I did not receive any feedback in terms of being successful or unsuccessful. The first communication was an automated email to complete this survey. 

Completing the loop would go a long way to ensuring applicants knew if their application was still active or if it had been unsuccessful. 
"
I would recommend that all applicant who are not selected as potential for progression in the selection process are given at least a reason why they will not be considered.
I would recommend offering feedback to applicants regardless of whether they were short-listed or not. 
I would really appreciate any feedback you can give me
I would prefer to recive feedback on my application before reciving this survey link - it's a little bit annoying!
"I would not do anything more, since it already has everything you need to know"
i would love to have an interview with one of the HR members
"I would love to give a more expand feedback, but since I have not experienced the recruitment process conducted by J&J yet, I do not have a lot to say. Although, I really enjoyed all what I have received so far."
"I would like too get opportunity for job interview to present myself.

Best regards 
Bojan Simek"
"I would like to thank Charlie for being highly professional. 
The quality of his screening was very good and designed to capture the key elements of the role. 
I received good feedback but I was truly disappointed because I did not have the opportunity to discuss my suitability for this vacancy in a face to face meeting.
I genuinely believe I have the right experience and skill set for the role.

Thank you,
Sincerely,
Val"
I would like to suggest more alignment with linkedin in order to provide data transfer easily.
I would like to speed up the feedback process
I would like to see the stage of my application 
I would like to receive the recruitment process status when I apply for a company. Feedbacks are important also for the applicant. 
I would like to receive more information about where I am in the recruitment process
"I would like to receive feedback, if I passed the screening process"
I would like to receive feedback on what I could do in future to be selected 
"I would like to receive feedback from you each time I apply for open positions on your site.
Thank you!
Sincerely,
Alina Ionita"
I would like to receive a customized feedback when I receive a negative answer.
I would like to hear back on some of the position that I have applied for in the past. 
I would like to have some feedback on why I'm not selected for the function I applied for.
I would like to have my CV evaluate by someone from the area that I am applying for because most part of the time HR refuse my CV.
I would like to have more information on the state of  the process
"I would like to have feedback earlier and in every recruitment process
The application is very intuitive and practical to initiate the recruitment process"
I would like to have a constructive feedback to understand where I can improve my soft and hard skills.
I would like to get feedback about my candidacy.
I would like to get a feedback from HR
i would like to get a chance from my other experience
"I would like to discuss with the HR department in order to show my motivation toin join your company.

Best regards,

E. Tullier"
I would like the selection process to be faster and to have feedback from the company about my profile.
I would like suggest you to add  additional language - Russian. I guess it's expand number of potential surveyvors.
I would like a faster processing
I would just suggest a faster process of the applicant's job application. I have applied more than a month and a half ago and I haven't received any response. w
I would improve the user experience of the application tool. It wasn't really intuitive to use. I thought that I was already within the application process but only set up my profile within the system. Therefore I was a little confused when I tried to delete uploaded documents during the process which didn't work. Only after I finished my profile I could start working on it. I would set up the tool differently to make it easier to use. 
I would have been interested to know the level of the role in comparison to my previous role at J&J. 
"I would have appreciated a status E-mail to see am I still in the recruiting process or not. If an E-Mail went out it might have reached my spam box then. 

Otherwise very clear and good process. "
"I would feel very obliged if Johnson & Johnson managed to organize face-to-face interview in order to test my skills and offer me this position. Best regards, Valentin"
"I would appreciate to know why the hiring team has chosen not to pursue my candidacy.
"
I would appreciate to get a feedback on the application status  
I would appreciate more details when declining applications (what are pros and cons?). That would help to stimulate candidates acquiring new skills and make more relevant applications for you.
"I would appreciate if there was a function to save the online application and return to it later. I applied after being referred by a friend who works in J&J, and I did not wish to include a cover letter at that time, thinking that I would work on it and attach it later when I came back to the application. However, at the end of the process the application was automatically submitted, without even a chance to check it or go back to different sections to review them. Which left me disappointed that I missed my chance, because the cover letter, which I fully intended to write, was missing from my application."
"I would appreciate getting additional details when receiving a response regarding a decision not to pursue my candidacy. This would help in further considerations for other job openings with the J&J family of companies.

Thank you."
"I would appreciate feedback on my application. This is always helpful when looking to grow in Industry, 
Regards
Lisa"
I would appreciate a clear quidance on the process of what happens after application process together with clear deadlines.
"I worked in SFE project in iHeart-Media_Clear Channel Turkiye, and graduated from a reputable university. Besides, my experiences were at adidas Group, Metro Group -Media Markt and Deloitte. 
It is not easy for me to understand get any positive or negative response with related position. Johnson & Johnson was my one of my top companies to work in. But Human Resources process is not reflecting the company I was thinking before.  Regards,"
"I wish to work with this beautiful company 

Best regards "
I wish to get some feedback - why I (any person) is not fit to J&J 
"I will suggest Johnson & Johnson adapt the strategy of Arsenal football club that have football academic that trains talents to feed its premiership size. 

Your company could recruit talents from schools and have a programme for them throughout their studies. You identify the strengths and area of interest of each recruit, then you assign a mentor from the department where his or her skills fit to coach him or her. 

With this approach, I believe your company will get employees who will fit into the organisational culture from day one.

"
I will give reports on the operations of government relations
I will give improve tips after hiring me
"I will be happy to answer when full process is completed. At current, initial stage it is far too early to assess the whole process."
I will be able to answer this question after entire recruitment process. 
"I wasn't called for the interview at all. I was called upon by agency about the job, I was awaiting for interview, but never got the call back. "
"I was working in J&J before (on temp position), but moved to other country (UK). 
After application for position in 2016 and interview I was promised that I will be informed on the results and provided with feedback in 1 week. But nobody have had called nor wrote to me for 3 weeks than I rang myself and recruiting person promised to return back to me and also give feedback on my application. After another week I got reply with no feedback. Considering my previous employment at J&J I find it rather impolite. This attitude gives me no indication of whether I could apply for other positions or it is worthless.
1 month ago applied for another position and then received a call from someone from HR departments. After telephone interview I was promised that my previous interview results will be found and feedback provided. However, again no more contact nor feedback. 
Given my previous employment, references from previous supervisor and colleagues at J&J, I am lost with guesses whether J&J really looking for referred and knowledgeable employees or just making statement. There is also no indication whether I should stop applying for J&J positions or keep trying. Generally disappointed with recruiting process of J&J UK Wokingham branch.
Wist best regards,"
"I was very pleased with the fast and clear/valuable feedback received, so based on this approach, I have no recommendations on improving the recruitment process."
I was referred but in the e-mail that I received from the system the link to apply was not working. I even received it twice and finally I had to apply directly on the website.
"I was recommended by a person already working at Johnson & Johnson, but the link I got via mail didn't work properly. An error appeared saying the jobrole wasn't available anymore. You can maybe have a look at that process.   "
I was not told if my application was sucessful or not.It would be benefical to ensure all candidate s are contacted on the outcome of applications
"I was not sure what was meant by the question regarding the number of years of business experience, since to me, business could mean a number of different types of professional experiences. Given the broad range of backgrounds of applicants, this question can be improved.
"
"i was not involve in the recruitment process before with johnson & johnson.

the far i know, post the vacancies on linkedin as its the number business connection and deal with professional recruitment agencies."
"I was never contacted by a recruiter for the role,I received only the thank you letter"
"I was invited to Maidenhead for an interview with J&J after TA were very pleased with my application. I was granted an invitation to interview at J&J, and made the 350mile trip to meet with a SBM and Group Marketing Manager. 
I was absolutely delighted with this opportunity, and undertook extensive research into the company and its brand portfolio. I absolutely loved the credo, and the emphasis on employee care and the obvious development opportunities. I researched my two interviewers, who had progressed with J&J from entry level to senior positions and I found this extremely motivating and exciting and I really believed and valued J&J as an employer. I received an email from a member of the Talent Aquisition team with tips and advice for my interview, and I was ready for my interview. In the meantime, I was asked to sit another numerical reasoning test before I met my interviewers. 
I made the 350mile trip to Maidenhead, and was introduced at reception and taken to sit the test. I understand the test was part of company protocol, but felt the questions were extremely impractical for the role I was applying for, and my time as a Brand Manager and my CV demonstrated my competency with analytical thinking and managing data. I was told my score did not meet the required level and was then told I would not be granted an interview. 
I was absolutely distraught and after the recruiter apologised (""It's bad news, sorry mate!"") I was then escorted through a side entrance and left in the car park. I have never been made to feel so patronised and small in my life. Despite the invite to interview, I wasn't allowed to sit and take one. I had travelled 350miles for the interview, and had planned and looked forward to this for 2 weeks. 
I was absolutely appalled in the manner that J&J had held this interview, and gave no regard to my credentials as a successful ABM and BM in previous roles, nor my academic background and CV. In an interview, I believe I would have demonstarted my competencies, and genuine desire and passion to work for a company, whose values are true to my own. 
I left the company with an extremely low impression, and really lost faith and value in the company, who treated my application in such an ill-manner. 
Completely patronised, embarrassed and unappreciated, despite feeling real faith and desire in a company that I thought I could have developed as a professional and a person, and have comtributed a real passion and determination to succeed in the role. 
I will very seriously consider ever applying to work for J&J in the future after being made to feel completely second grade as an applicant. 

It is with regret that I write this review, and I look forward to hearing from you. 

Yours sincerely, 

Ieuan Evans"
I was informed in the phone screening that I will hear back regarding the recruitment process within 2 days and it has been a week later and I still haven't received any answer.
I was impressed by the high levels of description and process explanation about the role I was applying for. It left me with a good and positive feeling about Johnson & Johnson and something that other companies could take as a great example  As far as I'm concerned I'd find it difficult to find an improvement that could be made.
I was good to receive immediately an automized confirmation of my application but it would be either helpful to get a personal feedback of the current status of my application.
"I was expecting a call for this position.
Though i did not recieve any cal,still i filled this survey with an expectation if being selected for this position."
"I was contacted to review my cv, and they were keen to arrange a short 15 – 30 minute call with me to discuss my background and experiences further, prior to passing my details to the hiring manager for review. I had replaced the same day and was available any time that week as I was off work.
The following week I emailed an update of times I could be contacted as I was back in work.
On both occasions I never got a reply and to date no contact has been made.
At a minimum a reply would have been appreciated."
I was called in for interview one day and the following day the interview was postponed. I haven't heard anything since. 
I want to get all the information and work with you as a professional before applying for the advertisement and I want to request an interview
"I very much enjoyed the recruitment day! However, the assignment of the reverse jobfair wasn't completely clear to me. I do realise that the personal interpretation is also part of the assignment.
Furthermore, I heard from classmates who applied for the same traineeship that they did not receive an answer from Johnson & Johnson after taking the video interview. Even though they had put time and effort in it. "
"I understand it takes time to get back to applicants-  but as someone is on the lookout for a job - time plays against him in his favors. a good way to keep a candidate interested , would be to keep him ""warm"" - an email that application is in process or whatever. just a reminder that you are on it.

"
"I understand a lot of applications are received, but a quick feedback would be highly appreciate it.

Best regards"
"I thought the recruitment process was fluid and simple. There are a lot of companies that you do not hear back from, regardless of the response, therefore I really appreciate the response and the quick turn around. I would definitely feel confident in applying for another role in house. 

Something to potentially consider is giving feedback on how we could improve. Even just one sentence or bullet. This may make the process more time consuming, but just a thought for candidates that would wish to apply again in the future."
"I thought the process was very comprehensive. The only issue I had was being emailed details to the wrong email address despite requesting otherwise on several occasions, however this was not a major issue."
"I thought the application process was quick and I was kept updated at every stage. J&J's recruitment process was enjoyable, especially in comparison to other companies. "
"I think, that the reaction on my interest to work in your company could be faster.
But real feed back I will give you after interview.
Thank you for your interest and have a nice day.
Bye"
"I think your recruiting process should be able to connect with some social networking media like XING or LinkedIn.
"
"I think you look very proffesional, that.s including the recruitment process"
"I think you judge people too much in recruitment process by education and connections, not how candidates apply and by their resourcefulness and ability to adapt and learn."
I think you have to evaluate the graduation but first of all I think it is very important evaluate experience and character of the candidates: a candidate with excellent graduation is not always a good worker.
I think you have a great system not much l could say to improve it. I just wasn't the right fit for the role applied for but the application process was straight forward. Thank you 
I think you are the Best company for emploeers
I think you are doing a good job.  Also sending feedback to candidates who were not chosen is great.
"I think video conference would improve.
Best regards."
"I think this survey is the first step of the recruitment process therefore I can make comments on your questions after getting the next steps.
Thanks,"
I think this role for your cmpagnie is greating for your and mine image. 
I think this process is better than others.
I think this currant process is a good one
I think they need to improve it by sweeping up the process of getting people hired quickly.......
"I think they need to give new candidates a chance to prove their abilities. Although, an experienced person will prove better in terms of not requiring as much training as a new candidate but new candidates have a lot of potential and if trained well, could prove very fruitful. "
"I think they could get in touch in a different way with people interested to work for them. And especially in a timely manner, which did not happen the first time I have applied for a job in this company."
"I think there's an internal problem in recruitment process concerning positions in middle east , I had a negative experience few months ago .
More openness & clearance is needed when you decide to reach for talented calibers for senior positions . "
"I think there are not big problem about the recruiment process,i have only the hope to be part of this fantastic group"
I think there are many talented candidates who loose their opportunity because of their poor resume decoration. 
"I think the recruitment process, as far as I know, is ok like it is. "
I think the recruitment process works very well considering the amount of application received.
"I think the recruitment process will be better if we have systematically an answer for an application, even if we are not matching."
I think the recruitment process so far has been straight forward. I would be open to providing more feedback based on the overall experience once the process is complete.
"I think the recruitment process of J and J is very efficacious relative to those of other companies. But if i should propose some improvements, i would say adding room for recommendations will help HR rate applications."
"I think the recruitment process is well established. I would like to hear sooner about the application progress, but I understand recruiting takes time."
I think the recruitment process is well done
I think the recruitment process is quite clear.
I think the recruitment process is quite appropriate
I think the recruitment process is already very clear and straightforward. 
I think the recruitment process is already at an excellent level of quality
I think the recruitment process as it is already well suited for a company such as J & J.
"I think the process was successful and a great oportunity for me to learn, but only one thing to improve the process would be the slow time from one interview to another."
"I think the process was quick, professional and intuitive. I look forward to the next step with personalia contact!"
I think the process is successful
"I think the process is intuitive and easy enough, maybe I will propose a follow up and a faster feedback about the progress of the recruitment phase, this is useful for any person who applies to a position."
I think the process is good 
I think the process is correct 
I think the process has been very Professional.
"I think the priority is to make the interview with interested persons before taking the refuse decision depending on the C.V's and cover letter.
Some times the papers not reflect the real person and you can discover something you need it from the person during a short conversation."
"I think the only thing to improve especially in my case is to provide an answer.
Until the e-mail about your process improvement I didn't know if I was involved in the hiring process or not.
I received no answer from Johnson & Johnson, and must admit that I expected a little bit more.
A rejection e-mail would have been enough 
"
"I think the only thing J&J could do to improve the recruitment process is to still provide an answer to the candidate, both positive or negative.

"
"I think the data forms should be updated because they seem obsolete.
Additionally, Java system does not work on all browsers."
I think the current process very impressive 
"I think the best method of recruiting staff is to make conversations followed by a trial period just so I think it is possible to create a synergy between worker and company and to understand what important values they have, I also think that serious and willing staff is the Added value to the company"
"I think the application should be able to review his application before submitting it. The curent application you don't realize it was the final step until you have already submitted the application.
Another option is, to enable the applicant to look at all the questions he is going to answer and not having to answer each one before being able to move to the next one. 
Thank you"
I think that your job listings are available for the people who is looking for a job in your company. So you do everything correctly.
"I think that this is a really good system, talking about the recruitment process. The only thing that we should do is to make clear what the Service Customer (in the case) has to do. A part of this, everything is alright (My personal opinion)."
I think that this company can improve the time of the answer.
I think that the whole process is very clear and understandable
"I think that the recruitment process the Johnosn & Johnosn it's well timed.
"
"I think that the recruitment process is well specified, the candidate for the position must have an overview of your oncology portfolio as well as about  the new products that the company wants place on the market. Oncology as a specialty in the pharmaceutical sector is the most difficult area. It is a state within a state.
Anyone working in this field must know what is expected of him.
A description of the position you posted is clear and well specified."
"I think that the recruitment is in fact very thorough, with three exhaustive and serious interviews to the candidates, so I would not add anything else to the process."
I think that the process what simple and clear and I think that this survey is a good idea for jnj.
I think that the process of recruitment is good
I think that the process is good
"I think that the online application process is very efficient. I do not know directly the subsequent procedures adopted by the company to recruit new staff, but from what I read on the website, there is a preliminary phone call and, in case of positive feedback, an additional interview. I think that is the appropriate method to understand if the candidate is suitable for the position."
"I think that the offer should indicate when is the incorporation to J&J, which would create security in the candidate."
I think that the current recruitment process is already clear and well organized.
"I think that the company should create more direct relationships with candidates. Furthermore ,  should try to test how many more possible candidates to assess their capacity and have a confrontation face to face. 
I would like to work for a big companies with Johnson & Johnson. 
Thanks for giving me the chance to express my opinion."
"I think that the better process to appreciate the candidates is to meet them face to face (or by skype) to get a clear idea about them and to see how much they are motivated for the job.
Best regards."
I think that the best idea to improve the recruitment process is skill test or something which will help to check if position will suit to personality. 
I think that the application form could be improved: the application process allow me to complete the very essential sections of the candidature. Only browsing around the careers submissions allow me to find optional sections of the candidature to fill.
I think that recruitment process is very suitable. I would not change anything in the process
"I think that one point to improve would be to indicate to the rejected candidates the reason for the rejection.

Thank you.

Kind regards"
"I think that Johnson & Johnson present a very intuitive and of great quality recruitment process. One of the things that would be interesting to improve is the time to receive the result of the evaluation process, but in most cases is a complex process that needs time and dedication. Congratulations!"
"I think that Johnson & Johnson doesn't need of improvements for recruiting process, it is a great and strong company"
"I think that Johnson & Johnson does not have to improve their recruitment process. In comparision to other recruitment processes I have to say, that it is an advantage of doing a survey. "
I think that Johnson & Johnson can do personal interviews.
I think that Johnson & Johnson can ask more skills to improve the recruitement process.
"I think that J&J provides an accurate and recruitment process, easily accessible."
I think that J&J could add the status of the recruitment process after the application of the candidate.
I think that J&J Company has to meet all the graduate students with the top markes. The selection can't be with only resume sent. 
I think that it's working properly.
"I think that It is primary importance improve the selection process because the times often are slow.
It is also important that the description of role is precise and detailed. I happened to apply for several internship but I am graduate recently and instead you sought a junior profil, but it was not wrote in the description of job and so the response was negative."
"I think that it could be very useful to include in the process activities such as  personalized interviews to evaluate the profile of the candidate. It could be also  interesting to pay attention to the personal part of the candidates. These are data that can help the company to know if  she/he is a good candidate for the job.

Besides, the possibility of including in the recruitment process some tasks related to the position allows the company to interact a bit more with the candidate and discover talents that could not be detected through a simple conversation or a written exam."
I think that is sufficient.
I think that in the candidate selection process for a position in a company Johnson must enable employee personal meeting with the employer.
i think that before to ask for a survey you should get an answer to the candidates in order to be able to evaluate the process
I think that all the path of applying to posts is intuitive enough. I didn't have any problems with it. 
"I think that a face to face interview could be more effective than a phone interview, even when used as a first filter."
"I think sometimes CV's may be lost if the application pool is too crowded -even your skills&background matches with the related job. If I receive personal message&feedback about my application instead of no-reply automatic messages I will be sure about my application has reviewed in detail and feedbacks will be very valuable for my next steps. I know it will bring extra HR workload but If this process will help you not to miss well-performing candidates, then it will come out as a good investment overall.

"
I think should be to make technical exam as soon as in sales field .
I think screening of resumes is important step;however I prefer to arrange an interview with candidates who fitted 80% of your requirements.
"I think recruitment Processing was  very good with this Survey to Show that its Important for you Company to higher the right Person for the right rol or position. To answer this question rightly i really dont know what the Company does after surching the People becouse the first thing is surching but next steps is to Place the right ones in the right Position. I thank you and Hope the best.
Best regards
Mandana"
"I think nothing. J&J is well represented in job portals and the application process is very easy to understand. 
The job interview was very well structured and gave a valuable insight in the job. "
"I think more consideration to the fresh graduated  and little experience candidate will be good for both, for the company after a fewer training they will have loyal and high motivated employees and for the employee he will has a good opportunity to be creative and initiative specially when the person just start at work field he still has that spirit to do something to change the world, and that what the companies need to be more focusing on.    "
"I think Johnson&Johnson can improve the recruiment process with job interview. If you want to it I'd like to job interview. 
thank you. 
Best regards."
"I think Johnson recruit process is very interesting and selected....it could be interesting maybe to focus a little more on describe Better the position opened....
Thank you "
I think johnson and johnson should provide specific questions related to candidates qualification or what do they seek in the candidate per position so that they have the right shortlisted and fasten the recruitment process .
I think Johnson & Johnson should  find new  candidates on linkedin with specific research.   
"I think johnson & johnson is going well through the recruitment process, But I noticed that few other companies keep the applicants CVs for the next available positions.
And I hope that johnson & johnson is one of these companies.

thanks "
I think Johnson & Johnson has a good recruitment process
"I think Johnson & Johnson has a good process of primary recruitment, although it is necessary personal interviews to see the qualities in action"
I think Johnson & Johnson doing fairly well in the recruitment process.
I think Johnson & Johnson can send an automatic e-mail which explains the whole recruitment process step by step to the applicant. Applicant will have an idea about what can be next in recruitment process by this way. 
"I think Johnson & Johnson can do to improve in the recruitment process is not taking so long to call the candidates to an interview, because if he or she is the ideal candidate, and be in other attractive selection processes will probably lose a good candidate.
"
"I think JNJ should take into consideration the history, background and experience to bring potential key assets. My impression is that a not detail review was made in my case an/or perhaps job postings may be just a protocol but the person is already chosen."
"I think J&J should fasten the process of screening and the  relevant recruitment process. 
Should be in touch of applicants by some way to know the progress of application. "
I think J&J is on the recruiting trends wave and up to date.
"I think J&J have to care their talents, help them to improve and give them and opportunity. "
I think its important to provide updates to the potential employee - there has been past application experiences  in which I have no idea what has happened to my application.
I think its fairly straight forward and simple . nothing much should be added. 
I think it's necessary to evaluate also personal skills and some interessing life experiences.
I think it's great the way it is 
I think it's fine
"I think it's fair, I just hope I'm in with a chance of getting a job there "
I think it's bitter to recruit skilled and practical sales people rather than people those with academic degrees.
"I think it's a perfect recruitment for both, company and candidat."
I think it would be good to get some feedback on the application process as to why I may not have been selected as a candidate for this position
"I think it would be better to inform the applicant the situation faster than this , "
I think it will be a better idea to create opportunities for people from diverse educational backgrounds and also to open up other outlets especially in the developing world West Africa in particular.  
I think it may be beneficial to advertise roles on numerous job recruitment websites to maximise possible candidates applying for various roles that may lead to larger applicant pipelines of expertise. 
I think it is pretty good as it is.
I think it is necessary for all the needs of the team to be a very successful organization
"I think it is a good idea to really curious about the opinions of the employees. 

I attached a short letter from the person who works in this position. Who describe why so good this job. Why so good working with the Johnson& Johnson. What gives it to work here. 

I think it would be even more effective."
"I think in case of applicants which are not hired but showcase a strong profile they should be spoken about the gaps and whether they could be considered in the future in case they are improving certain skill.

I believe diversified people make organisations great and the company should sought out these profiles."
I think if j&j  can take the step of having thier short list interview over the phone would be better 
i think if it's ok
I think i would be fine to get a prompt feedback to the further course or a rejection of my application.
I think I was a good candidate with the skills required  but J&J refuse me early. 
I think I should be informed on time about the status of my application. It has passed a while without knowing what is happening.
I think i feel well supported in every sense. Thank you
I think everything  is Ok.
I think creating events & seminars will help more to get the best talent job seekers.
"I think as an applicant, I was sent a generic email that told me my application was not successful. Unfortunately this email gave me no insight in what I needed to do in order to be successful in the future. It would be extremely helpful to applicants if you provided a more detailed explanation into why the application was not taken on any further."
"I think apart from the current process of recruitment could use to create applications for mobile devices. This would be convenient, faster and more intuitive."
"I think anything else, the recruitment process is already clear and allows to underline all the candidate's competencies and skills."
i think all of the recruitment process areperfect and HR department does its job extremely good. 
I think a video call by Skype will make the job interview more pleasant for the interviewer and the interviewee.
"I think a proper feedback needs to be given to the candidate. I am a MD, PhD with an extensive experience in research and clinical experience as well. I am an invited speaker at international platforms, but have never gone to the interview stage at Johnson and Johnson. I have applied for more than 5 jobs, have a doubt whether the application is really reaching the correct decision maker."
"I think a more personal approach would be ideal.
A automatic email from a major company such as yours is not expected."
I think a face-to-face interview would be more effective for a position whose duty is to do face to face communicate with the people.
"I thing everything is OK with the process, just need to add some feedback if the candidate wasn't invited to the interview. "
"I suggest:
Invest time in planning the strategy.
Reduce the costs of the process.
Local Knowledge and labor market.

Who am I looking for?
What type job profile?
Where and in what channels find this profile?
How to choose my candidate?"
"I suggest you to ad in the ResearchGate, as a well-known academic webpage."
I suggest you meet the candidates in a short time on the possibility of being selected or not following the presentation of CV or response to a job announcement.
I suggest to include a similar survey during the application process in order to better understand the personality of candidates.
"I suggest to have a tool showing the application status. Also in case of disqualification, it would be very useful to send a brief feedback to the applicant with what are the key 3 missing compatencies in his or her profile."
I suggest to develop the recruitment system by updating the candidates with them application status . 
I suggest that Johnson & Johnson should conduct IQ test either online or actual for initial validation of applicant's qualification.
I suggest that a time frame be given to the applicants regarding the time needed to give a feedback about their application 
"I strongly recommend to get back with a feedback to people who applied for the job, as soon as you can."
"I still not having an answer from the process, it will be great to have dates to know when the candidates will have an answer."
I still haven't received a follow up call / info after 2-3 weeks after sending my CV. I would appreciate to be informed about the time scale of the interview process to set my expectations correctly about when I will hear from J&J about the following steps. Thank you. 
I still haven't been told if I was successful or not. I only got an email to acknowledge they received my CV (which is great - as some places dont even do that!) and then this link to take a survey...nothing else has been communicated to me. 
I still didn't hear anything about my application. I would appreciate it if i can get the feedback and not from the template one :)
"I so far have not actually heard the results of my application, so perhaps more feedback could be provided to applicants."
"I see these first steps of the recruitment process as a good process, so I would leave as is now."
"I see the recruitment process was so far easy and smooth.
I liked the idea of getting people feedback about their recruitment experience..J&J is one of the best."
I see that's clear and satisfies.
"i see it optimal, regards"
I see from point the J&J way of recruitment is very simple and easy to submit our CV for the available position.

I say thank you for the interest shown.
"i resedent in saudi arabia and i have valid iqama but i can go to any country which my job needed with work viza from your side
Thanks"
I recommend you to observe all CV's and give  feedback about the prosess.
"I recommend to have clear automatic notification during the screening process to regret or to confirm the application in order to keep the applicant on the same wave length. this is not only of the favor of the applicants but it reflects the genuine caring and professional way of doing business during the hiring process.

Wish you all the best."
I reckon that the recruitment process is good enough. 
I recently submitted my application and did not experience the whole recruitment process. The questions on the online application website were very clear. 
"I receives email notification from J&J that iam not suitable for the xxx position. i request J&J that to give me a opportunity and i can prove myself that iam an asset to your organization. 

"
"I received this request from the Talent Acquisition team re the role I applied for in March. One would have expected another communication in between the acknowledgement of my application and a review request.

At this time 6 weeks later I can only assume my application was unsuccessful  "
"I received this questionair about my application (24-Mar) even before I receive any info from my application itself. No contact info can be found, FAQ link does not work. This is is something that should really be improved!"
"I received the requests to complete this survey before receiving feedback on my application - at this point I don't know if it has been successful.  

kind regards
Alison"
"I received information about this recruitment by another website. By this way, I applied for a job on Johnson& Johnson website. In my point of view, it's not enough easy to be informed of new Johnson &Johnson applications. Fortunately, one of my colleague knew your company."
"I received an initial, personalized acknowledgement email, which I really appreciated. The email made reference to needing to assess internal talent, which I would have expected you to have done before posting externally, unless your intention is to benchmark internal talent. The message said I would hear again in 2-3 weeks which is about now, so hopefully I'll receive an update."
"I received an email refusing my application not even 1 hour after I have sent it, on friday evening.
Which means that you didn't even read it, whereas I spent 2 hour of my time to prepare it. This is obviously computer managed. Not professional. Not respectful. Last time I apply for J&J. "
"I received an automated response within 30 minutes of my application with a rejection. I understand I might not have used all the key words that most of the portal requires in order to get attention to the recruiter/hiring manager. Anyway, I am still waiting to hear about the other roles I applied for at the same time. And I am keep getting request to respond to this survey. "
"I received an acknowledgement in response to my application soon after submitting it but I haven't heard back anything else for over 2 weeks now. It would be good to get an update with regards to the timelines and whether my application is being processed & considered for the role.

"
I received a no we are not interested at 9.15pm exactly three hours after my application. My criteria totally fitted however it was a straight no and this will stop me applying again.
"I received a job spec' for AR Lead and agreed I filled the majority of the expectations / requirements.  Afterwards however I was asked to complete a GL test.  Unless I missed something, I would have preferred GL requirement to be more clear. I failed the test as I new I would, I am not an Accountant, but a people Manager.  Whereas I can motivate, engage and Train, I specifically lacked the GL knowledge.  It may be down to my experience so maybe J&J do not need to change anything.  I was disappointing not to have been successful on this occasion but will certainly probe further in the future to ensure I full understand all requirements and if specific tests relate. This was I can also save time for the company and the selection process.  Working for J&J will remain an aspiration of mine."
I received a confirmation of application received which was positive. A possible improvement could be to send a generic email advising a date that interviewing will begin and if you haven't heard from us by this time you have been unsuccessful with your application. 
"I really would be thankful if you don't share this idea to public.
I have an idea of using customer to filter candidates ""situation/role wise"" so , because our customer ""even in B2B case"" we can nominate our best alliances to involve them in the selecting process as an initial filter."
I really enjoyed every step of the recruitment process. It wasintense but  fair. It not only assess whether the candidate will be a good fit for the company but also gave me the opportunity to assess whether the the role and the company will be a good fit for me. Probably one of the best process I have been through. 
I really dont have any comment on how to improve Johnson and Johnson recruitment process as I believe you have the right people when it comes to hiring employees that suits and qualify for every position.
"I really don't see what more J&J can do, but I am sure the current practice is unique, specially sending survey to candidates.

"
"I really cannot complain about it, maybe J&J could give some more information about the role"
I really appreciate they way J&J follows up on the process and gets feedback.
"I prefer a more personal way, to have the opportunity to have contact person"
"I perfectly understand the volume of job applications is huge, and for that reason many technology tools have to be used such as electronic CV matched profiles. But I would strongly recommend to review more en depth some of the CV received, because maybe the organization couls loss the opportunity to recruit a good resource, just for not giving them the opportunity at less of one first interview."
"I only can underline the importance of securing the right talent for a company and from my point of view, Johnson & Johnson takes right steps for the right hiring decisions.

Regards,
"
I only applied for this post so I do not have an extensive experience in providing judgment on the issue
"I noticed that this position had no questions to answer, I feel that is a better method, as I know that the screeners could potentially screen out otherwise qualified candidates. I realize that something is needed to whittle down the massive volumne of applications, but feel that it is more inclusive and hopefully more effective."
I never recieved any feedback after submitting the application
I never received a call or email on the status of the position. I know this is common but being kept up with the process even if it is automated is helpful.
I never heard anything regarding my application. It sounded like a great position and it's been a good few weeks - even a courtesy rejection email would suffice. Great company and would have been nice to work with you. Love the product and ethos - bit of a shame about communication. 
I never heard anything back from my original application.  Very poor. 
"I never got the privilege to be part of Johnson & Johnson recruitment process. So it will be too difficult for me give any suggestion for any kind of modification of your recruitment process.

Thanks"
"I never got a response to my application, neither a rejection or invitation to next steps, which I consider an affront and which impacts my future probability of applying again. The time and care I took to complete the application should be enough to warrant a reply regarding my application status. I would even value a ""nice"" rejection email, then I would just know where I stand."
"I never got a reply on my application.
Maybe this is a thing to consider to give a positive/negative answer
Makes a much better impression as a company"
I never even received an acknowledgement for this application so this survey is superfluous !
"I need to see all process before giving feedback. 
Some firm can be fail for  giving result of the face to face interview even they have a good reputation. 
Communicating by technologic is not enogh to measure it.
How people feel when they are your guest for interview in your building ?, what they think about interviewers ' behavior towards them and other people they see in your company, are they the smiling , happy ext.?"
i need to go the full process to figure this question out.
"I need to enter my language skills multible times.
"
I need to be a part of the recruitment process first :)
"I need to admit that there are two major factors that I would perceive as issues. At first, JnJ (more precisely Jansen) still test on animals and this is something I find hard to accept. 
When it comes to the recruitment process, I think it was really well managed and met my expectations."
I m so happy.and it is perfect.thanks
"I m in the beginning of the recruitment process.If i have the opportunity for a face to face meeting , i will be able to share my feedback.
Thank you."
I liked the application process and the detail being sought.. 
"I liked and appreciated that it was a short and direct process. Keep it up.
"
I like the recruitment process as it shows the required skills and the nature of the work 
I like the process. Additional and timely feed back to the candidates who applied would be of additional value to the process 
"I like Johnson & Johnson's product as well as the company. However, what most upset me during the recruitment process was by rejecting by the policy of UKBA, but I am still holding a valid visa. As a big company, Johnson & Johnson is able to sponsor any of his employer. I am truly disappointed about the rejection reason."
"I know the recruitment process can be very demanding, with lots of applications coming in day by day making it even more difficult to pick the right candidate but quicker feedback to those applications would go a long way in helping the company and the applicant in the long run."
"I know that your company has a respectable place in this area. I want to advance by taking advantage of the experiences and knowledge I have gained in the position you specify in the short vault.If possible, I would like to meet face to face as soon as possible and give you more detailed information about the values that I can give to your company.

Best regards,"
I know that you have many application but maybe you need to improve personalized approach to candidates. Everything else is high professional.
"I know that there are a lot of candidates for different positions but maybe there is a possibility to get a feedback earlier how long it takes or what are the current status of the application.
"
"I know Depuy and Synthes since a long time and know that the products are excellent.

To send my CV to the carreer portal was easy. 
10 days I got an meeting for an telefoninterview. 
The interview was relaxed and the questions was coherent and logical. 
Now I'm waiting for the next steps and look forward to the next steps.

In the moment I can't make improvement suggestions. The process is in progress. 

"
"I just apllied for Job and so far no calls or progress towards the next step. Therefore I beleiev its too early for me to comment on this.

I think this should be done at the last not the very beginning until its a process to evaluate the Job posting to which I feel it is moderate.
"
"I hope to get a feedback on my application.
Also updating an application on the stage of the process would be nice (e.g. ""we are selecting the resumes for this position"" or ""we are interviewing the candidates""), to communicate how urgent you need a person, and how long the recruitment process might take upfront (I'd really like to work for J&J, but I wouldn't want to miss other opportunities waiting for a feedback, as it's not clear if I'm going to get any feedback at all). "
I hope the decision making was faster
"I hope that Johnson & Johnson has more opportunities for foreign students who cannot speak French. I strongly want to work with Johnson&Johnson.
Thank you for your consider!"
I hope that HR sends the reasons for acceptance or rejection for each job applicant.
"I hope everything is doing fine, maybe later i will get know what is good to improve. At this time I dont have any ideas."
"I highly recommend company must be open to any other countries.  I want to be part of the success of the company.

Thank you."
I haven´t been contated by anyone yet - more than after two weeks from sending the application.
I havent got a call for response for my application but have got this survey before.
"I haven't yet received any response from J&J as to the progress of my application. I would appreciate if I am informed about the status, have the interviews started, is my application take to the next level etc."
"I haven't seen yet the full process, it seems to be just a beginning, therefore it is hard to suggest any valuable improvements at this stage."
I haven't received any response to my application. Any response or just a confirmation of receiving my application would be great. Thanks so much 
"I haven't received any feedback on my application at all, so not sure what to comment on or why I received a third email to evaluate the recruitment process."
I haven't noticed yet something to be improved .
"I haven't heard yet from any J&J representative, so maybe better communication with the applicants, either the answer is favorable or not."
"I haven't heard from you since I have applied onlne (I even don't know where I am standing in the application process ). - Why?

Ref 000019D5, 4l.weber@bluewin.ch"
"I haven't heard from the company 
Wish they were more communicative "
I haven't heard anything from J&J since submitting my application last April. I therefore don't feel I can comment on the recruitment process at this stage.  
"I haven't got elements to value the recruitment process yet. This is just the beginning...
Best Regards,
Alessandra"
"I haven't got any feedback regarding my application yet. I propose to send out this surway once the recruitement process completed or at certain, predefined stage at the process."
I haven't got any feedback after confirmation that you received my application
"I haven't been through enough of the process to offer any valuable suggestions. 
So far it's going well.
"
I haven't been selected to be able to suggest improvements about the overall recruitment process. I would suggest recruit me and I can suggest enough ways of improvement and automations (which I specialize in). 
"I haven't been contacted yet, so, I can't really point out anything. Although, it has been less than a week after the initial application, therefore, I might just have to wait a little longer."
"I haven't been contacted since I filled the application for the above role.
It would be good if you can send follow up communication to applicants illustrating the recruitment progress. e.g. email shots.
Thanks"
"I have' had any feedback up to now.
A feedback on the application is always important ."
I have worked with J&J in past and admire it as most professional organisation to work with. It is perhaps the best training house to provide an over all development opportunity to an individual. 
"I have worked with clients of Johnson Johnson, enterprises that use Johnson & Johnson products hour to hour and  minute to minute basis but, I have never met a representative from your company. It would help recruitment process if you distribute more information about Johnson & Johnson employment opportunities to most employees like me, who work with your products on daily basis. It will also help recruitment a great deal if you let students in medicine, nursing and all other leadership aspiring healthcare professional like me understand your internship and fellowship programs, if you have them. Because of the changes and expanding healthcare economics and technology, academic and professional training schools are emerging fast, and, the fast you get in touch with new emerging professionals the better for recuitment.
Thank you for allowing me an opportunity to comment in this space."
"I have the feeling that if the first time a candidate has not been considered for a position, it will always be the same for all other positions, as if there is a list for ""unsucssessfull  applications"". I think  applications must be studied  for every role independantly and objectively. 
For the middle east jobs I have the feeling that it is impossible to have even an interview when we are not in the country. although I have a French passeport, I cannot live in the country ( UAE for example) before I get a job so it is impossible! I recommand reconsidering overseas competenties through skype or even through local J&J agencies ( in french for example, the local HR can decide whether I am a good candidate or not, even for overseas roles, since the poslicies of J&J are same anywhere on the planet). 
Thank you."
"I have received this survey, without having been contacted by anyone from J&J in regards to my applications."
"I have received this survey and I think that Johnson & johnson takes a proactive approach.

I just have one suggestion : to indicate clearly the status of the application"
I have received no info if the process had been completed.
"I have pretty much enjoyed the recruitment process so far. Thank you for that ! It is very quick and easy to use and provides a good overview.
"
I have only just completed the first stage of the whole recruitment process so I cannot already give some advice how to improve the process. 
I have only just applied so cannot comment much. The role profile was clear but the role itself was not readily visible - I had searched for some time on the internet for such a role. 
"I have only experienced the initial stages of the recruitment process namely the submission of my application and initial telephone interview. I have been advised that a 2nd video interview followed by a physical on site one will still take place consequently I cannot pass comment on the full process. 

However, sufficient information has been given to me thus far and I feel that he recruitment process that I have experienced to date has been good.  "
I have now received an employment offer from J&J so I am now working my notice period from my current employer. It is great that I have a named HR contact but it would be useful if I could have a named contact in my business area also so I can ensure I'm as well equipped as possible to hit the ground running when I start
I have not went through the formal interview process yet. 
I have not received feedback yet. Would be nice to get feedback on my application.
"I have not received any feedback on my application except for the self-generated email. It's  been over a month and the position is still open, however no news from the hiring team on where they stand with filling this position. It would be great if they could let people know that the process is still on-going or they found an internal candidate etc. This silence is not very professional, esp when i sent  an additional email to the Talent Acquisition person with additional information. Thank you. "
I have not received any feedback as to status. 
I have not received any feedback afterwards - I think it's extremely unprofessional.
I have not received a response regarding the outcome of the application. Being updated would be nice.
"I have not participated in the recruiting process, I just applied but I did not obtain any answer."
"I have not notes about improvement process,everythings fine"
I have not had any communication since receiving confirmation of my application on 13 March.  An email confirming timelines or whether the application is pending or has been declined would be good. 
"I have not got an interview experience with Johnson & Johnson. 
So unfortunatelly, my feedback might not include a proper evaluation that reflecting recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson, properly.
Since it is a global, institutional company I wish I could evaluate that process closely and achive the procedures to start a new job in such a well-known, global company.
"
"I have not gone through the recruitment process. But in terms of a digital application, the process seems professional, coherent and well monitored. "
I have not been interviewed yet for the position so it's difficult to assess
I have not been contacted since I submitted my application (10 days ago)
I have not been contacted as a result of my reaction yet.
"I have not been able to follow the status of the process online.
I have requested access to IT but no response several weeks after...
"
"I have not applied to this role. I was approached by J&J MEA Talent Acquisition for a potential future role. Role was not specified to me.
My last position which I held for almost 8 years was Regional CFO (VP Finance) for Pfizer Africa and the Middle East.
Thank you"
"I have not any additional comment on that issue. 
Very Best
didem t."
I have no suggestions or advice to improve the recruitment process. I think it's well-designed.
I have no objections
I have no experience yet
I have no comments
I have no comment here as it is just an ad. on the internet and i responded to it. Mean that I have no previous experience with your recruitment procedures or steps.
"I have never tried to have an interview with J&J but i hope in the future and i will be available to provide a feedback for the recruitment process.

I have never received an answer from your company. Positive or negative. I recommend you to send confirmation emails to potential candidates.

"I have made a very positive experience while applying for this position.The recruiter has made an extra effort to scan my profile as a candidate and scan the  available job-profiles. Based on a suitable match I was approached by the recruiter and asked whether I would also be interested in another available position.
Just a minor point: from a candidate's perspective, it would be optimal to have a shorter time-gap between the first and second interview round. "
"I have literally applied for 10s of vacancies by J&J and I do not believe all my applications were weak, therefore I assume the selection system has some fault, which I cannot understand and consequently overpass.
"
"I have insufficient experience to answer this question. 
"
I have had very positive experience with JnJ recruitment and the Talent Acquisition team so far. Keep it up!
"I have had no feedback, that would be useful and rather than relying on email and web analytics it might actually be good to engage with real people.

Today many people hide behind the internet in one form or another, at the end of the day business particularly high ticket value products in a niche market comes down to communication often on a personal level.

I am not sure that is remembered but long term it will affect your bottom line and you will look like a company that does not care."
"I have got informed that external job recruiter company ""ListGrove"" will process further in my job application towards this J & J job. Through email I got fixed up telephone call appointment with ListGrove, but ListGrove not called me & till today don't know why.? Also not clear why ListGrove not interested in my application.?

Needs continuous improvement or change in this recruitment process from external recruiter. Thanks. "
I have found the recruitment process to date to be extremely efficient from job application to being called for interview. The interview itself was also well conducted and covered job specific information in an appropriate way. I was also givin clear instructions on what the next stage of the recruitment process would be and when I should expect to hear back from the hiring manager. An excellent experience overall.
I have found the process so far to be helpful and clear
I have found any difficulty to apply.
I have experience of store assistance in reputed company of Nepal ( Sipradi Energy Pvt.Ltd. ) for the 2 years. I have knowledge of dispatch of goods and experience of how to load and unloading of goods from warehouse. 
"I have completed a telephone screening process and have been advised of next stages. I await further information and therefore am unable to comment on the full recruitment process. That said, the current experience has been enjoyable and I found the interviewer easy to converse with. I did ask for further information regarding the size of site, number of people, turnover etc however, the interviewer said the information was not available at the time - perhaps the provision of basic information during initial discussion may be an improvement for the company. Apart from that the process has been acceptable and I felt the questions enabled me to match my skills with job requirements. "
"I have been unsuccessful in aquiring the job, however I have never been anounced officially. I think this could be done as an improvement, in the future."
I have been invited for a telephonic interview so far and I still have to go through the whole process. It will be premature to provide suggestions right now regarding the recruitment process.  
"I have been following business opportunities for a long time. I want you to know that the feedback process so much important for the job seekers. It is very important to provide negative or positive feedback on by the phone or via an email. 
Job seekers want to be careful. You are one of the best companies that make it to them successfully.
To shorten the time in the job purchase process. To be fast and sustainable.
To inform negative candidates as soon as possible.
 To wait and hope is the hardest craft in the world."
"I have been eminently qualified for the jobs to which I've applied, yet I've only had one in-person interview (six people at one time!), and one phone screen by an HR rep who had no knowledge of the job offering and parameters, so I had no chance to go to the next level.  I have worked at the senior level for larger global organizations and felt the treatment was not only unfair, but not a good reflection of the organization.  Since all experience with a company represents the brand, then the brand experience was poorly representative of what charter, and history, of J&J.  Still, I know if I went to work for J&J, we would share success."
"i have been checking J&J middle east career section in the past 6 years, only very senior positions are listed ( specially sales positions ), so it seems all other ( non senior ) positions are usually referred by internal employees."
"I have been applying several times over the last months for different roles. I understand how attractive is your company and the fact that you may be drawned with an incredible number of applications, however as an appliant i deplore the absence of human Relationship or feedback from you.
I even never had a chance to know a bit more about your reputation from Inside (question above) as the connection with your people was pointless so far.
It sounds inconsistent with the values of the company when the feeling i have is that my experience in an american company and my agile personality should be valuable to your teams and company. "
"I have applied to so many supply chain / logistics / SAP IT related positions in JnJ within the last 1 year, but most of the applications were rejected by sending an automated rejection email by the HR system, this procedure need to be abandoned as it reduces the chances of selecting potentially skilled and experienced future employees. I strongly believe JnJ is an equal opportunity employer without considering a person's race, religion, ethnicity or age group. Also need to give more preference to online applications rather than entertaining job agents by HR partners in the selection process. The hiring line managers must go thru all the potential applications to see the candidates experience and functional knowledge rather than the HR person makes an initial selection process. I have an MBA (from SUNY Buffalo), an Engineering degree, SAP and supply chain certification trainings, completed lean six sigma and project management trainings, but my applications are getting rejected by JnJ HR system, this is really disappointing especially from a global MNC like JnJ! Why not give me a chance to have a face to face interview with the hiring line manager and find out my capability? Hope the HR Senior Management will look into it and correct the practices. Thank you"
I have applied to J&J several times over the years and my applications have always been rejected although I only apply to positions that strongly fit with my profile. I wish there was a chance for candidates to understand the reason and how to make a career shift from consulting into Johnson & Johnson. I have a very successful career as a Director at a top tier consulting firm in Value Chain Management and I would have thought my profile should at least get me a phone call for the Director of Value Stream Leader opening.
I have applied many times for a position but never did I receive a reply or invite to an interview. 
"I have applied for this job almost 1 month ago. I have since have had 4 interviews with other medical device companies and am progressing with the hiring process in those.
I still have not had any feedback from Johnson & Johnson to state what is the current progress with my application.
Kindest regards,
Kevin"
"I have applied for the role almost two weeks ago and up to date i am not aware of the status of my application. I have received the initial email asking me to complete online candidate profile, which i did, and to which email i received another confirmation email.

I would expect to receive an email confirming if my application was successful and stating what are the next recruitment steps. I would also suggest for such survey to be sent out after the recruitment process is completed. "
I have a great desire to work in your company. I am sure that will be useful.
I hardly found application form. 
"I had to save my application before completion, when I came back it was no easy to find how to start again with the process. "
I had some technical issues with my laptop.
"I had some issues with the website when editing and uploading info,and it would be nice to have an online application tracker"
I had great organised Talent Acquisition interview. 
"I had contact with Mrs. Grießhaber from HR and was asked about the duration and timing of the internship. After this I neither got an invitation nor a refusal until the present day. I would still like to get an invitation for a personal interview.

Best Regards

Christopher Stapelmann"
"I had applied for a specialized position; where the application had been taken up only as most of the requirements matched with the jop post.
i received a response swiftly (is a good point) on J&J deciding not to peruse the candidature. But would have been great as to why as this was not a generic application but a specialized one.

Rgds"
"I had an education and experience preferred in the job description, so I'm pretty disapointed that I wasn't given a chance of a job interview or at least a phone call. I would assume the company received many offers, but I would expect a little more interest based on the match of my education, experience and knowledge and job description.
Thank you."
"I had a lot of problems with the website and it is difficult to find a contact point for when the website does not work properly. I am also currently trying to apply for a position, but am again facing issues with getting into the website. "
"I guess the main factor to improve your recruitment will be to be more reactive. Just take the example of Lego which is also a big company, they are able to answer in less than 3 open days there. That makes a big difference and make applicant feel taking care of properly.

"
i guess once i selected than i can tell you 
"I guess nothing at the moment to be done, the recruitment process was smooth despite some difficulties while applying on the company's website, but later the talent acquisition manager did a good job in arranging for my interview."
I got no feedback whatsoever but was asked to fill in this survey - candidate experience is not very positive
"I got it done easily enough, so it is at 100 % Quality Assurance level."
I found the recruitment process so far very structured and straight forward. Well done!
"I found the process interesting and valid but difficult to fill out the information.
"
I found the process easy to follow. The role responsibilities were clear. Additional information could be team size and how the team collaborates if possible to include at the initial stage when applying. 
I found the process and application procedure straight forward and informative. 
I found the online process to be comprehensive and extremely user friendly.
"I found the HR team to be very proactive, positive and skilled in asking me questions about my career and how my skills will fulfil the job criteria.

My CV has gone to the Business Unit and I await to find out if I progress to the next stage.

In doing my homework on Johnson & Johnson and Janssen, I definitely want to work for the group."
"I found the application intuitive and easy to use. I think it would be helpful to let applications to let them know the status of the recruitment process, i.e. whether one is still being considered or whether the position has been filled. Thank you."
I found that recruitment process is quite slow. After more than a month I'm still waiting for the next step.
"I found it really difficult to reach up to the hiring manager and at the end, I could not reach. I would appreciate if some contact of the hiring manager is given. It gives a chance to the candidate to have some interactions on the possibility of fit and better know-how of the projects. "
I found it a very friendly and pleasant conversation
I found every best about the recruiting process of Johnson & Johnson but still kindly make being responsive to candidates a priority.
"I find the process very good
"
"I feel, employer should not judge the applicants on the basis of resume, some time attitude and knowledge is matter which can' t be mention on resume.

So,they should call for phone interview  and decide.


"
"I feel that the process is very automated. If a person would contact you regarding the process or where you stand in the process, that would be helpful and an improvement. It lacks a personal touch. "
"I feel existing system is already user friendly, transparent and simple."
I feel current process is good.
"I expected an automated message about not being good for the role or that you needed something else about my profile if the case was given. 
Other than that, I would say there is nothing else to improve."
"I enjoyed the pragmatism, clarity and professionalism perceived through this tool. I suggest to add the possibilty to attach more than one document, in my case I could attach a slide of my transformation project that I use to help in implementingm changes in the companies.
Federico Voltolini "
"I doubt that the company is likely to or inclined to change the process however I think if it were to do so it should be made clear not only that previous sector experience is preferred but that the lack of it automatically disqualifies. It is clear that years of relevant, international experience at the highest levels of communications and government affairs are deemed irrelevant without sector experience. It would save time for all parties if this was made completely clear from the outset."
"I don´t know, i just apply to the position of Legal Director and now I´m waiting por an answer.It´s still too early to be able to value it"
"I don´t have many experiences with recruitment proces in corporate sphere, so for me everything is absolutely correct and professional until now. Just the occasion to be part of this recruitment proces that´s very good and positive experience and I would be only happy to have an occasion to look at another parts of process. Thank you. "
I dont know. The recruitment process is simple and clear
"I dont know the recruitment process of J&J; however, I would like to mention that there are many older and experienced people in this world, especially in the legal profession who are capable and are able to deliver, which needs to judged not based on a person's age, geographical location or a reason that he/she is over-experienced. As long a person is ready to work, that should be the criteria among other requirements. Thank you for providing an opportunity to express my view even before a person is being selected for a position and I havent seen any company providing such an opportunity. Really appreciate. Thanks."
"i dont even know if my application was rejected or is progressing.There is need to give a candidate a feed back on the weakness and strength of his application.
It is more important to me as an applicant to improve further applications down the line."
I dont believe that their are any improvements that need to be made at this stage.
"i donot know but i have send my c.v for several time last 8 months and i have do mo interview till now its big question mark for experience one 
in survey i believes it is better to not put odd no of choices as it may lead fake results "
I don't see any requirement for improvement. Communication has been regular and clear regarding process and next steps. 
"I don't see any recruitment 'process': I fill out the application, submit my resume and hear nothing until this survey arrives in my inbox"
"I don't recall having heard anything since the application other than this request, but I do appreciate having any opportunity to critique the application process to help improve it for others."
I don't know.
"I don't know, they will certainly come up with a brilliant idea."
"I don't know how your recruitment process is going but my advice is to speed it up at least to secure any applying good talent.

Thanks for giving a room for an applicant to share his thoughts."
I don't know because i haven't yet begun the process
I don't have much experience in HR department but I think you proses until now is perfect to me but I don't know about the whole process cycle 
"I don't have any specific suggestion since the whole process was very smooth and clear. It was a great experience, I learned a lot and I really appreciated the detailed feedback I received.
Thank you.  "
I don't have any idea on what would be useful for the recruitment process.
"I do think heading an email to a candidate that has been rejected without interview with: ""Sean, we'd like to hear from you..."" is particularly insensitive. 

Certanly altered my perspective of the organisation, reducing my favourable view. It gives an impression of a more inward looking organisation than I know is the case. 

A solution would be to either:-
a) only contact those who have been through the fist stage, reducing overall responses 
b) rephrase your email header to not give the first impression of a callback

Good luck. "

I do not see need for improvement. It went smoothly and flawlessly.
I do not see need for improvement.
I do not receive any communication about the status of my candidature.. I would appreciate if you could let me know it sooner. I assume I am out of the process because of this email.
I do not know. This mission of HR
"I do not know why you have not progressed with my profile, if you can give feedback on why.

Best wishes,"
I do not know the total process but they could ask 3 questions during CV sharing process. The answers could be effective on the face to face interview short list. 
"I do not know in in detail J & J's recruitment mode, however, I think that at the beginning the careful reading of the curriculum vitae and them alignment with what is required in the research notice may be the best way to improve this process ."
"I do not know how to improve it, since it has not gone through a recruitment"
I do Not know
I do not have enough elements to evaluate it. 
I do not have any suggestions at this moment.
I do not have any idea about J&J process. I can tell my opinion on general recruitment process.Giving more chance to more people for job interview is a good idea to find correct person for right positions.
I do not have any comments concerning inmprovement so far
I do not feel anything is needed at the moment
I do not consider myself to be an expert in the field of HR. Offer of vacancy I found at  Indeed.com and responded to that proposal. The selection process for to me is absolutely clear up to now.
"I do appreciate you reconnecting with me asking to participate in this survey. 
My suggestions are as followed:
- Do not go to 100% match of job requirements, at the first round of the hiring process.
- Giving chance to people that seems to be genuine and honest.
- Sometimes you are a 100% match for the position and are not getting invited to an interview (I don't know why).
- Scientist at smaller companies/ institutions can also be smart and hard working; give them a chance.
- Look at your talent bank; maybe you can find your candidates.
- Scientists with higher interest in J&J, will work harder because their mindset is set to pursue the company into a success. "
"I didn´t have the opportunity of any personal interview, I might suppose you  to have already a most suitable candidate.

In any case,I´ve apreciate your communication.

i didnt have any interview yet. so could you at least call me before sending a survey :)
"I didnt get a feedback yet. So, I can say nothing about it."
I didn't received any answer after applying the job. The only answer I get is this proposal to complete the survey.
"i didn't receive any reply after my application (just an automated email after the first step of the process): so, if I were j&j, I would consider the opportunity to improve the feedback process (even in case of lack of interest!). On the other side, I appreciate this survey as it gives the possibility to feedback: thanks for that! :-) "
I didn't receive any feedback after submitting application. Without feedback i only received a link to the sattisfaction survey which is weird.
I didn't notice any areas of improvement.
"I didn't hear anything about my application…..
So, please let me know something!"
"I didn't get any response to my application, whatsoever."
I didn't find any problem with the reclutation process
"I didn't face any difficulties throughout the process of application. It was clear and easy to fill up. Looking forward to face to face interview, where I may showcase my talents to a hiring manager."
"I did not yet receive any feedback after my application.
I think you should reply at least In/out before asking such kind of survey"
"I did not undestand why after have submitted my application I received an email from the adquisition team in which I was informed that I had been preselected, but they asked me to complete some steps that I had already done when applying. Then I did not have any more news about the process. This has happened to me in the 3 applications I have made. It's a bit disconcerting.
Kind regards
Alicia Lyon"
i did not recieve any feedback from your side about my application .
I did not receive any information about status of my application
I did not receive any communication from J&J either way concerning my application. I did not know if I was being considered and did not receive any feedback. 
"I did not receive an invitation for an interview, only this questionnaire, that's why I can't help you to improve hiring process, thanx"
"I did not hear back from the consultant after an initial discussion, did not get to a proper brief for the role and the headline on the job you are asking me to respond to says DO NOT POST.

I appreciate that this is an automotive response, but it is doing nothing for your employer brand.

Kind Regards, David."
I did not have any interview and cannot really tell
"I did not have any feedback from you. 
I am waiting any feedback - ok, not ok, neither fish, flesh nor fowl.
Thank you."
I did not have an opportunity to get involved in the recruitment process at the J&J company. 
"I did not had a reaction yet, so difficult to say."
I did not get any Feedback from recruiting department after submitting application
I did not get a chance to participate in the first stage because of an IT issue and then after having the link someone told me that all the spot had been filled for round 2. 
I did not find anything special to improve 
I did a video interview for the Johnson & Johnson University Hire Programme 2017 but I never got a reply or feedback any further on that. I would have liked a feedback even if it was not positive. I would say I'm disappointed the way it turned out as I'm still unsure of the outcome.
i couldnt get any feedback from you about my application. you should speed up your process. thanks
"I could be interesting to introduce a soft analysis of wills and expectations for this role.

Not only salary expectations but also working day life expectations.
"
"I consider this to early to express, since we had only one discussion."
"I consider that my experience and qualifications closely matched the role and applied on a weekend afternoon yet by that same evening had received the automated rejection email which leads me to believe that a human did not read my CV or cover letter which was very disappointing. If this is the case, it seems as though your automated system is rejecting applicants based on a lack of buzz words rather than merit. At the level of position and from a company with such a good reputation, I would have expected more consideration of individual applications. It would also be useful to have been able to email/print a copy of the total application."
I consider it as very good
"I checked a wrong gender when I applied. I tried to change, but it wasn't gonna easy resend the form. Could be more easy. It's my unique consideration."
"I case of not completing process, feed applicant back by the reasons"
I can`t answer this question at this stage. I'm just starting proces of recruitment.
I cannot judge because Im not yet involved in the j9b interview path. 
"I cannot give advice because I just had a telephone interview, non enough to evaluate the recruitment process.I would have liked to be called by phone to have the reasons for refusing my candidacy instead of a generic e-mail."
"I can't yet give a constructive opinion as I am awaiting a response to my application, so the process is not yet complete."
I can't think of any improvement in Johnson & Johnson recruitment process.
"I can't say anything certain because recruitment process is still in progress, but It will be nice to notify applicant about current status of application in detail (for example, application is being considered by the department of medical devices, health economics project managers). I think such notifications can provide a decent feedback for applicant.  "
"I can't really say, as I haven't applied for a job for many years. "
"I can't know how to improve the recruitment process by the company.
I think that the company already adopts the most appropriate methods in the recruitment process."
"I can't judge it yet, as I haven't received any feedback yet. "
"I can't evaluated this. Stilll on the beginning on the recruitment process - just send 10 days ago my CV, received back automatic massage and that was all."
I can't estimate the recruitment process of J&J because I didn't pass it
I can't answer this questionnaire clearly because it is too long since i applied for the position
"I can't answer this question fully, as I have only just applied via the internet and am awaiting feedback."
"I can see that J&J can include ability tests related to the job in recruitment processes,
my point is, it doesn't matter only that the candidate is technically fine, but he/she should have also the ability to develop & improve in the area he/she will join 
I believe that above can support the business & create good successors 
thanks, "
I can only describe the application process and I've found it really easy to apply.
I can not add anything.
"I can imagine that because of the many applications, there can't be a more personal process.  To review hundreds, if not thousands of résumés is difficult and I don't doubt you want to make the process as effective and efficient as possible.  I would hope you would be using resources like LinkedIn to see a person's qualifications as you are sorting through the candidates.

I have the highest respect for J&J and wish you continued success."
I belive that the current process is good 
I believe they have to look over the Experience and skills of nominees with more focus (on previous experience) and making face to face interview with more urgency to can capture more experience talented people on board. As some of nominees will not wait the long time process of interview and hiring specially with senior positions.
I believe there must be an opportunity analysis specialist at talent acquisition department. Maybe you catch valuable people for JNJ!
I believe the recruitment process is fair and reliable. 
"i believe the process is absolutely well defined, in case or delaying of processing a notification caN BE SENT TO APPLICANT , in addition to profile match or fit doesnt happen"
"I believe the hiring process for the position I applied for and that led to this little questionnaire is still ongoing. In that case, I think everything was done correctly and in a nice and intuitive manner. In case the hiring process has already finished, I would suggest to send an e-mail to all applicants that have applied, so that people can know their preferred job is not available anymore and move on to other desired opportunities. That is all. Keep up the good work, all the best!"
"I believe that the social Media is currently the Best mean to adequate recruitment and Johnson & Johson will definitely attract the potentials in the market especially with the company's image and reputation, think what it really matters will be the selection process and I'm sure that the company is capable to absorb the talents that will provide an added value to the department and the company as a whole. "
I believe that the recruitment process is very well structured and doesn't require improvements.
I believe that the recruitment process in place is fair and good.
"I believe that the experience I have had thus far has been fair  and adequate to the stage of the recruiting process. From the experience of a past application  at J&J, I feel that I have benefited form the time and attention dedicated by the recruiter to a extensive level."
"I believe that recruitment process via email would be better if all applicants receive messages regarding their application and whether they will be considered or not 
""Silence doesn’t always mean that decision regarding your profile was taken ""
However overall I see the online process was one of the best ways I have ever seen and I was very comfortable with ALL level of questions  
"
"I believe that recruitment process should not favor any particular gender and ethnicity, it should be equal for all the ones who apply. Moreover, while recruiting a new resource the organization should have a well versed career development program for the candidates as per their skills and capabilities. It will not only help the employees in their growth but also augment organization's overall performance."
"I believe that Only the Paranoid Survive, The Company have great products but speaking about KSA their representive depend on its reputation
If I have a chance to compete with similar product I would easily take market share from them......
If you recruit me I promise that I will do what ever it takes to be no.1.period
Another is not having foreign nationals VISA in Critical areas where hard work is a necessity.
Kindly check my LinkedIn profile,I am already known internationally across the globe in Muscloskeletal Community with near 4000
Again.....Think like Kodak and Sears and you will become one.

I believe selecting candidate would consume a lot of time as each CV received  must be reviewed carefully. I hope HR could select the very right candidate to fill vacancy in the company.
I believe Johnson & Johnson can provide a better life not only for its customer who uses there products but also for its employees.
I believe is fine as it is now.
I believe adding few more questions to the online process will be of help to ensure that the applicant meet the job requirements. This will be of help to qualify reasonable number of applicants. Thanks
"I beleive across the table conversation is better where you can judge the person easily rather then survey  which any one can easily solve looking forward to meet you life is good.

"I aprecciate the fact that the company anwers back to the candidates.
Best regards and keep up the good service"
"I appreciate the Survey very much because it shows that you care about your future employees and their oppinions. 
What I also like very much is that you have a Video for the different positions, where an employees talks about his/her roles. This helps the candidates to get a Little sneak and peak of the work he/she will be doing. 
I do not see any specific Point that should be improved. 
Kind regards"
I applied to this position like a month ago and still haven't heard anything from you except this survey. So I would say that one mayor issue is the cycle time of the hiring process. I'm sure you want to find the best candidate to the position but don't you think that if the candidate is good he/she will not be available by the time you start reaching out to them? E.g. I was hired by one of the big insurance companies to a senior position and I only had 2 interviews with the HR director and the COO. The cycle time was 10 days between applying and hiring. So good luck improving your processes or outsourcing it. 
"I applied to J&J both through internal J&J system and headhunter website (hh.kz) about a week ago. I'd like to know the results, if possible"
I applied several times to j&j job positions without never being called for an interview even though I think to have all the requirements to manage an interview with j&j. So my suggestion is to give more opportunities in terms of interviews to the candidates who apply for a position like I do.
I applied on Feb 27. Today is Mar 15 and I haven't received anything except two requests to fill in the survey.
"I applied on 23rd, today is 28th and still no feedback received. The improvement would be, instead of sending a survey you would better send a followup email. Thanks."
"I applied on 16 March and received an automated reply. I suppose the company won't take me into account as I haven't heard anything since;  it would be good to hear whether or not you are still in the process. 

thank you
Fran Jansen"
"I applied for two jobs at Johnson & Johnson - in one application process (relating to several engineering positions) I was only asked if I wanted to upload a motivation letter, in the other application process (relating to a precise engineering position) I was asked if I wanted to upload a covering letter. I wished that both options could have been choosed in the application processes.

In fact that one job posting I am interested in relates to several engineering positions and I want to apply for a part-time job in this area, a input box for comments is missing where the desired position, the working hours and the corresponding salary can be described more precisely."
I applied for the role several weeks ago and have not received any reply/update on the status of my application. 
"I applied for the role and received a voicemail message from one of your Talent advisors. I called back and left a message. Since then I have had no further communication from you.
I think that is extremely poor and regardless of whether you feel that I am suitable or not you should at least give me a courtesy call or email. I have had neither! "
I applied for an internship more than 20 days ago and I am still waiting for feedback. 
I applied for a role and got a rejection note without a reason and you wanted to rate my satisfaction? Well very unhappy about the process and your decision against my application.
I applied for a position 3 weeks ago and haven't heard anything so an update would be useful. Other than that I couldn't fault it.
I answer this Survey without having any kind of feedback from You. I ve answered already to it following my last application 
"I am yet to receive feedback on my application, so not able to provide feedback at this stage. But I believe it will be a great experience and will be more than willing to provide feedback once the process is complete."
"I am very satisfied with the recruitment process. I dont think there are any changes which need to be made. I would be honored If I get the opportunity to work for such great company, with a very good reputation and products me and my family use. I am totally identified with all the products and it will be a great pleasure for me to recommend them."
I am very impressed with the recruitment process of  Johnson & Johnson and I don't think any other thing to be added in the recruitment process.
"I am very happy with the process, easy to understand, also the speed of reaction on my application and first interviews set-up. "
I am very happy with recruitment process
"I am uncertain why I have Ben asked to complete this survey prior to hearing from J&J regarding the progress of my application. I had thought that such surveys were traditionally sent out after a candidate had been rejected. This makes me wonder whether I have missed s communication from the company.

Overall though the process has been easy from my perspective. I would just like to have seen more communication from the talent acquisition team.

Kind regards, NS"
I am unable to comment the full recruitment process since I did not performed the interview. Bases on my platform experience I consider it user-friendly and with all the information that you need regarding the job offers. 
"I Am sure you receive hundreds of applicants. But those who put time and energy into your detailed application process should at least get some feedback. 
A email saying your application is not successful in this day and age where employer recruitment is seen as a brand in itself does not do J & J justice. Maybe I won't apply for a position with J & J again!"
"I am sure you must have heard it hundred times but may be this time it would change your mind - Feedback. Yes provide feedback on why you reject a candidate. I can understand if you dont provide feedback for an applicant whose profile just doesnt match. But in my case, I discussed my profile with another JnJ employee who is working in the same team in Zurich for which the job was posted, I was referred by that employee as being a good fit for the role and yet I received a standard rejection reply from HR which just makes me think that no one actually read the application or profile in detail. How can it be that the level of understanding about my profile is so different between the person who really understands the role and HR (who is supposed to understand the role). I have also hired people in my team many times and made sure that profiles which are referred to me by internal members do get a detailed feedback on why it was rejected. This is your duty as HR team to act for ""human resources"" who are applying to your company by taking out time from their life. You owe this to them.
"
I am still waiting to be contacted so haven't gone through the recruitment process yet
I am still waiting for the answer on my application. So at the moment I can only say that the whole process could go a bit faster :-)
"I am still in process and have been unable to talk to a talent acquisition person for over 2 weeks. They never answer and are not responding to emails. However I get a voicemail saying they want me to come to a assessment centre but I don't hear anything further - hence didn't know where/what time etc... 

Not great from a recruitment perspective. "
"I am still at the beginning of the recruitment process, so far all communications and contact have been verz professional and met my expectation. "
"I am so far content with the job posting
Thank you"
I am satisfied with this process of recruitment since I feel the importance of real feedback and  great attention and respect from Johnson & Johnson.
I am satisfied with their recruitment process.
I am satisfied with the recruitment process. It was correct.
I am satisfied with the recruitment process. 
I am satisfied with the recruitment process and quite sure that J&J provide an equal opportunity and affirmative action as a great multinational company as Bristol Myers Squibb.
I am satisfied with the recruitment process
I am satisfied
"I am really eager to work at J&J, and I would appreciate receiving frequent updates about the status. "
I am quite happy with the recruitment process so far. A general suggestion would be for the process to have more steps online and less steps offline/face-to-face.
"I am quite disgusted that although I can show a number of matching points in my CV for qualities and experience sought for the role, I was neither considered as a candidate nor contacted in any way by the local Swiss recruiters. I have now applied for countless positions with JandJ in Schaffhausen, and I am clearly wasting my time. I wish your recruiters would be more honest about the qualifications and more specific about candidates whom they would ignore - it would save us all a lot of effort!! Googbye J and J, I won't be applying any more!"
I am pleased by the response of the people at the reception desk and Mrs. Linda Diels. It was a professional reply to the questions I had. I am looking forward to a similar approach of the talent acquisition team member that is in charge of my application. Thank you for your time and effort.
"I am pleasantly surprised by the good treatment received by the company. 
I thought it was all correct."
I am ok with the process
I am not sure why my CV is getting rejected but I would like to get atleast chance for interview to represent my expertise and willingness to work for Johnson and Johnson. 
I am not sure but I believe you are using some automation to reject the candidates.  I have applied for several positions and not ready to accept that my qualification was not the best match for a single post as I went through the Job description and requirements very carefully!!!
I am not sure
I am not familiar with the entire recruitment process.  I only filed an application. I appreciated the efficiency and transparency of the filing process.   
"I am not be able to provide insight on how to improve the recruitment process at Johnson & Johnson. Thus, I have not been through the recruitment process. When that time comes, I would greatly provide input."
"I am not an expert to answer this can of question.

But in a positive way, Johnson& Johnson take care to answer all candidate. "
I am not able to respond at this stage.
"I am not a great fan of cloud style HR management. I am not sure that anyone in Switzerland sighted my application, and am not confident that the talent specialists in the cloud would recognize the relevance of my previous positions with Mathys AG Bettlach in Bettlach of CSL Behring in Bern, both of which have highly developed and structured training programs with which I am well accustomed. I appreciate that the position I applied for will go to a younger applicant, and will take this to heart when considering the pursual of further opportunities."
"I am just suprised to receive a Survey , as I didn't have a contact with the company ( positive or negative ) after my application "
"I am in the first stage of the process since I just apply. Should the Company ask me for an interview, I will have more elements to provide my feelings.

I am hoping to hear on a timely basis as to my progress through your recruitment process.
"I am hoping that J&J would give anyone (regardless of the nationality of the applicant) to have a better chance in the position not because of the ""working visa"" for which I think the major factor I am not considered for the position especially in EU countries. 

I understand that there are so many talented applicants who applied for this position that is because we believe in this company.  

Hence, my experience in a multinational company gave me enough exposure to different functions of Supply Chain. I have a wide scope of knowledge and I am confident that I am well equipped with skills and expertise that would qualify me for this position.  Thanks "
I am happy with the process 
"I am happy with everything. 
Call me please.
Thanks!"
"I am familiar with, what I would guess, is a large recruitment plan at Johnson and Johnson.  I have positive feelings with the process so far.  There are some very small improvements that could be made in the software and website, yet the information available to me as a candidate is extensive and complete.  The only thing I would ask is you hire me soon.  :)  "
"I am extremely satisfied with the recruitment process (i.e. application process)so far. I`d be able to give more detailed feedback after a phone screening or a face-to-face interview with a Recruiter / Talent Acquisition Team Member.

"I am experienced sales manager and have been in Multinational organisations for the last 12 years, I have applied twice for a sales manager opening in J&J Gulf but unfortunately no one came to back to me either for an interview nor apology email.

Would love to join such great company and that'swhy I am looking forward for a clear feedback about my application so I can improve it in the future 

Best Regards,

"I am confused, because on Linked in portal it looks, that recruitment process is no longer valid but from the other hand job post is still visible on other recruitment portals.
"
I am completing this survey only after applying for the position.  I have heard nothing else from the company.
"I am committed to join J&J as I believe in the company's mission and values. I believe in the succession planning you provide your employees and top performers.

I am however waiting to hear back about my application to that role as I have t heard back from the TA team. And I would really appreciate the consideration."
"I am aware that J and J get a lot of potential candidates looking for jobs but I think those that have relevant skills based on the job scope, but don't make the short list, should still be contacted anyhow to find out more about them
as there may have been more to their experience that wasn't defined so clearly in their cv. A more personal experience would be appreciated."
I am at the beginning of the process so hardly to say.
"I am always neglected by the people doing the screening of candidates. I know J&J attracts great applicants but so am I, but I never receive an interview invitation. The only explanation I can find is that they are usually inexperienced HR analysts who cannot see beyond the fact that I would be transitioning industries, and that I am not currently in the US. This is wrong with your recruiting process because you are global corporation, who is losing strong candidates like myself seeking a global career. If a senior Finance executive interviewed me, I am sure that with my passion, education (Engineer, Chicago MBA, Fulbright Scholar), and Finance experience (10+ years in FP&A and Treasury in operations and corporate), I can convince him/her that I can quickly transition into healthcare, and continue my global career with J&J. cagomez@uchicago.edu 5511970979132"
I am actually in an initial stage so I have not yet an overall view of the recruitment process. I will provide the feedback as the process is completed.
"I am a natural introvert,for me to get past this stage would involve me putting on an act.(It felt like I was applying to go on Big Brother)"
"I am a highly experienced professional with both SAP and Supply Chain expertise that J&J have already paid handsomely for - as a consultant.

The process of applying for jobs however is very mysterious. I can't seem to connect with any of the Recruiters - which I understand cant happen for the vast thousands of candidates - but Partner-level SAP Consultants ?

I'm applying to roles that I am sure I have very strong credentials for - and I receive a form letter back two weeks later stating the obvious - that the process doesn't recognize me. I'm sure that if the right recruiter at J&J got his / her hands on my resume - and thought about it for 3 minutes - I'd be a Senior Director working for the Supply Chain organization or for Steve Wrenn / Daniel, etc. I don't know these gentlemen personally well enough to approach them - but I know J&J very well ( Project Gold, back to basics, etc., etc._).

How do I get 5 minutes on the phone with a real person ????"
"I also applied for the position manufacturing technician, I completed the on-line aptitude test but never heard anything after that, an email after to say something would be good. "
I agree with the recruitment process currently in place at Johnson & Johnson.
"I actually never received a negative answer from J&J, I am just figuring now that I am not selected for an interview.... maybe a point to improve, instead of sending surveys to whoever make an application, an actual answer on this application would be more interesting"
"Humanize the process...
A simple call ,a phone conversation to say , yes or not..."
HR team should look more deeply in to the CV.s
HR doesn't respond in better way. Thanks. 
HR could be more interactive.
"HR contact should act in awareness of the fact that, during the application process, she is representing the company and its values. From this aspect the way of communication with applicants and behaviour is key, since applicants measure how far proclaimed values and employee approach are aligned with reality. My experience with the related HR contact unfortunately made me to quit the application process even before attending to the scheduled meeting with business contacts, and the reaction of the HR contact confirmed me on the correctness of my decision"

How long should I wait to get an answer?

"honestly, I would like to be a part of high reputation company based in Dubai. 
As we know Dubai is a huge market with a high number of different nationalities of the population. 

but, receiving a resume of a candidate should give me a small brief of people who are interesting and willing to do the job role.

"Hi,
Thanks for the opportunity to share my feedback. I applied for an HR Advisor position where you were looking for someone with up to 2 years experience with in an HR environment. I have about 6 years experience having worked in-house and with an RPO and worked very closely with some extremely talented HR professionals at global brands. I am looking for a fresh direction and an opportunity to help me learn on the job while doing my CIPD intermediate certificate and although it was apparent that this was not going to be financially as rewarding as my other roles,I looked at it as an opportunity to learn and change direction. Sadly, your recruiters have disappointed me by not even bothering to check why I would apply. I do understand that you get many applications for an entry level position however, checking motivation is also very important. The positive thing was that they responded quickly however, in this case I would have appreciated if they took more time and saw the merit. 

Thanks,

"Het is in mijn optiek wenselijk om een 1e persoonlijke reactie op een sollicitatie binnen 2 weken te krijgen. Dit kan een korte reactie per email zijn in de trant van ""we hebben uw sollicitatie ontvangen...etc, etc"". De sollicitant weet dan dat de sollicitatie in behandeling is en voelt zich daarnaast ook ""gehoord en gezien"". Een telefonisch/video-interview zou in mijn optiek binnen 4 weken tot uiterlijk 6 weken na de sollicitatie ingepland moeten worden. Ik probeer zelf altijd ""een spiegel"" toe te passen. Bijvoorbeeld: ""Hoe zou ik het vinden als ik pas een 1e antwoord ergens op krijg na 4-6 weken?"" of ""Als een arts/klant/collega mij iets vraagt en ik geef dan pas na 4-6 weken een 1e reactie, hoe komt dat over?""

Even though I was not selected for the process; I am still very happy that my application was handled promptly and in a professional manner.

Thank you again.

"Hello,
My one remark is that I never received a response (yes/no) regarding my application so this survey came as a bit of a surprise. 
I believe the recruitment process should always be a closed loop to give candidates an answer one way or the other. Where the answer is not in favour of the candidate, it is exceptionally valuable when a reason is provided. However I appreciate with high volumes this is a challenge. 
Regardless of my experience, I still view Johnson and Johnson as a great company and I would definitely consider other suitable roles in the future.

The skill set and background in retail sales were well balanced having worked in the pharmacy channel and most recently with healthcare professionals appeared to meet the requirements. 

To subsequently out clear the first phase of sifting and be given a first stage interview is incredulous in my opinion. I have requested feedback via the recruiter, however this has not been forthcoming. "

Solange ich direkt selber mich beworben habe, habe ich immer Absagen bekommen. Und sehr sehr schnelle Antworten.

I haven't been interviewed by your company so I could not suggest any improvements for the whole procedure of recruitment.

I saw that you post your job vacancies in many e-sources so a great number of candidates can learn for your professional opportunites which is great.

The working conditions seem very attractive and working for a succesful brand is always a huge asset for an employee.

If there is something that I could comment for this early experience is that I read on a well known career website some not very positive comments about not giving a lot of growth opportunities in your employees.

Finally I believe that this survey is a very nice and helpful step towards a better understanding of your candidates.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in this survey, I look forward to hearing back from you ."

Getting more products and making more sales .
Getting in touch personally with potential candidates with either a positive or negative response would be good. This has been the first response to my application made over a month ago.

Get some freshers and train them.

Get more information about applicant through online application process by adding more questions and mcq.
Get in touch via telephonically for initial interview.
Get email updates about status changes 
Get competent and knowledgeable talent acquisition HR partners. The one the hiring manager and myself interacted with was clueless and just made things more complicated if not impossible.
Get closer to the applicant and give addressed feedback.
Get back to the candidates in a timely manner.  I still haven't heard from HR about this role or any other role I have applied to!
"Get back to candidates, I have not received any feedback or status update but assume from this that my application has not been progressed.

The job description was very generic, due to wide scope of roles from restructuring, should have been more focused and specific."
Get a favourable response from the talent acquisition team for online applications
Further information about timing of the process 
"Further improve the video interview. 
For instance, you place the clock on the bottom of the video. I have noticed that I sometimes glanced downwards to check if I still had time left. If you were to make a color coding above the video (green until 1:30, orange until 0:30, and then red), people would see the progress in their peripheral sight and not look down anymore. I believe this would increase the similarity with a normal interview."
"From the job advert, it was not clear when the deadline for application for the role was. I thus took a chance, by applying, not knowing if the recruitment was still open. The other is that when I received the first call, there was no advance notice, so that caught me in the middle of another meeting. Thankfully J&J recruitment person was able to reschedule the call for later in the day. "
"From the interviewed point of view, would be helpful to maybe take more than one interview a day. Although I understand maybe is not easy to match the schedules of the different members of Johnson & Johnson involved in the recruitment process."
From the initial contact the communication has been poor. I was told I was on a shortlist and that the brief was to seek out more than 2 candidates to interview. Dates would follow. I was then contacted by a recruitment consultant about the role. When I informed them I was already in the process they asked for my CV to help me with other opportunities. I refused to send my CV. I heard nothing for weeks and was then sent an email informing me that I would receive feedback at a later stage about why I wasn't being interviewed. An ex colleague of mine spoke v highly of the company hence why I was keen to apply however my experience is a mismatch against this. 
"From my point of view, recruitment process is ideal, no points from my view to improve"
"From my point of view, one thing that you can do to improve your recruitment process is explain the reasons why the profile doesn't fit for the role applied."
"From my point of view, it would be great receiving a feedback after applying for the job or an update on job application status. "
From my point of view this should be complemetary to a face to face interview
From my point of view the process is very professional 
from my perspective a reply for the job applied (positive or negative) with in a week would be a very basic and supportive improvement to the candidates as well as the organization.
"From my personal point of view, I have experienced from other job applications as well, it is often helpful to have the contact information of recruiter and hiring manager available on the job advertisement. 
This helps candidates to have direct information from HR/hiring manager about the type of profile you are looking for, build up mutual understanding and identify the best fit from both side at the earlier stage of the application. It might save the hiring cost and target the best talent needed for the position.
I am also wondering whether it is realistic to have an open recruitment day at the site and invite potential candidates to come and experience themselves (not for the interview). Company might have closer contact with the potential candidates and candidates could decide whether this is the place they'd like to work for. During the visit, offer some social time so that candidates could have chance to talk to hiring manager/HR to get to know each other.

For this role the way of working is less proper. A personal contact would be preferred.

For the required position experience holder should get one chance for interview
"For the position I applied, I received a very prompt response that I have been rejected. When I asked the reason I learned that there will be no re-location provided for this position.

If it was so, that information should have been mentioned in the ad. itself. Or, if there is no relocation, recruitment team should have been posted only for Zug employees. 

In general, if there are candidates whose skills and competencies fit the job  posting and they are open to be relocated, it should not be a roadblock..

Thanks,

"For me as a candidate description of the job was done very professionally. Responsibilities, Tasks.In my opinion there should be no change."
For internal candidates the process should be a little bit more unbiased. When applying for roles I've often been told by my counterparts that a roll is slated for intended for so-and-so  and that it's just being posted as a formality. There is often not a clear understanding on how decisions are made it seems that the qualified candidates are often overlooked. In the past there have been roles  where the interviewer has hired a relative of theirs for the role. HR needs active role to in sure that decisions are made fairly as well as they should circle back with internal candidates and make them aware of why they were not selected for the role.   Not all of JnJ operates in this manner however there are certain support functions where it is apparent that there is lack of leadership in HR and the teams are really creating an atmosphere of an in equity.  It really tarnishes the company's reputation internally.
"For initial screening , some more job specific interview questions can be added, since with market situation, standard of education is getting better , day by day human skills are getting better due to globalization , hence competition is increasing , this will allow better candidates shortlisting "
For improving the recruitment process advertise the vacancy in all job sites.
"For candidates who are genuinely interested in working for J&J, contribute and add value, there should be a closer attention for profiles who are immediately available to start.

Taking myself as an example, I'm really willing and eager to join J&J and I'm immediately available to start. However, due to the ""normal"" timeline of the hiring process the delay on returning back to candidates might mean you lose great talent only because of the speed.

There should be a fast-track screening for candidates who are ready and available to start. In the end of the day, quicker you recruit, sooner you start seeing results on the required deliverables.

"Firstly, I thought your online portal was very intuitive and refreshingly open.

Unfortunately, I was relying on an external recruitment agent to put forward my CV for the position. But my CV was held back until the morning of the 2nd round of interviews, which I was unaware of at the time..

I was disappointed I could not be considered for interview, because I feel I would have been a great profile fit for that role.

To improve the process going forward is there a direct contact for recruitment/talent acquisition in house at J&J I can connect with?

"Firstly show what salary range you are looking to offer within your advert so applicants don't apply if not relevant. 

Secondly contact the applicant for more information. The applicant has made an effort to update their CV, write a cover letter & complete your online application form, just ignoring them is plain rude & doesn't prove you've actually looked at their CV."

The J & J is one of the top FMCG brand recognized across globe and I look forward to join the esteemed brand in my career progression.

The way J & J can improve its hiring process is if it can provide any status update of their application process. Most of the time, one applies to the position he/ she feels most suitable for and then their is no further reply from the company whether the position got filled or any interviews are in progress.

By implementation  a short status update might help applicants to keep track of the process.

I have been once interviewed before by the HR in Saudi Arabia. I strongly believe it was actually the most professional and sophisticated interview I have had. 

As I've seen on the website. This was the only vacancy in Saudi Arabia. Perhaps if more jobs were posted online on the website. You could have more varied candidates for different positions.

Also,I'd suggest a status icon for the job application. Whether its pending or under process, it would definitely help the candidates figure out the next chapter of their lives.

"Dear TA team,

Thank you for this opportunity to provide feedback to J&J recruitment team. In my opinion, the application process itself was standard, similar to what other companies follows. But what can differentiate you from others is the way you update the applicants regarding the application status. Even if it is a rejection letter, it would be great if you can update it as soon as possible with an automatic email with well chosen words. 
I know it would be practically difficult to go through all the profiles, one by one. But it would be of value addition to you to skim through the profiles, instead of running an ""algorithm"" for key word search, because, some of us can be valuable to you although we come from different industries.

"Dear Sjoerd,
I really think that the potential of Johnson & Johnson's organizational structure is more than enough to figure out how to organize and improve its various internal processes. Furthermore (we don't need to confirm that..), some years ago i had been your guest more than once in the role of project manager of a Marketing Company, to discuss about marketing proposals for some of your otc products, in the Italian J&J Medical head quarter near Pomezia - Pratica di Mare; so i can endorse what i have just written about your organizational structure.
On this basis, the question is: i am not considered valid neither for a working interview, so why you should ask me an advice on how to improve your recruitment process? I mean...what could i say? Should i tell you something just by visiting a web page or reading 4 main informations about the company? What kind of quality should my advice have? How much could it be useful to you?

I also notice i have received 3 emails all with in 5 mins of each other, do you honnintly think this is a professional manner of operating a multynational HR department I do not think so.

"Dear Sir/Madam,

I have always dreamt about working abroad. I think that nowadays contacts between European countries are very important and I strongly believe in cultural exchanges. I would be glad to live in another European country, as this experience would give me the possibility to gain important cultural and working skills. I enjoy the idea of develop new abilities in order to contribute to the vitality of the company I am working with. I am a social person, I have a strong teamwork inclination and since I have already had a professional experience abroad, I think I fit into the project.
I would be glad to have the opportunity to come over for an interview. Thank you.

Yours sincerely,

Luciano Cappuccino

"Dear Sir/Madam

I can't state clear thoughts about the recruitment process of Johnson&Johnson because i need to see all the process before i give you a complete feedback. For now, i could say that, It's important and needed to get opinions about the company for its PR operation, but a survey by itself is not enough.

"Dear Sir or Madam,

I think before rejecting someone just through online application form. You should contact them by phone to see what their intrests are. Maybe their will be other positions in your company where they fit in.  That will give a little satisfaction. 

Kind regards"
"Dear Sir Dear Madame

The process is not dad bad, but its finally a little bit complicated with de profile you have to set up.  Also to find the application form on the website was a little challenge. Maybe you can increase the storage (mbytes) to add forms like curriculum etc. But overall its modern and when you know how to handle it its a good thing in a good company."
"Dear Sir

Johnson & Johnson had great Recruitment team but they have to considered some new talent i personally feel in U.A.E that multinational organizations have polices to give opportunities to those persons who already working in well non organizations and don't take interest in employees who work in SMEs even though they meet the requirement of the Job like Educations,Experience.

"Dear Johnson & Johnson, 

I hope your read my comment, as I am intrigued by your follow up with applicants. 

This is the third reminder you send me to complete the evaluation. I reckon this is important to you. Unfortunately, you declined my CV for the role I applied for. What puzzles me though is that there was no explanation of any sort. I understand you get many applications, but a short simple reply with either ""not qualified, skill set not matching, too junior/senior"" is a minimal you could provide me with. I was even discouraged from replying to that email. 

Yet, you now are reminding me 3 times to spend time, and evaluate your application process, whereas you have not engaged with me at all regarding the actual application. I would have valued a personal response much more than completing 4 multiple choice questions. 

Looking forward to hearing your feedback on this.

thank you for asking feedback. 
I have really appreciated the overall selection process, got a feeling of pretty high professionalism and fairness. 
Unfortunately, my candidacy has not been pursued forward than the CV posting. 
An opportunity for improvement would be to provide feedback on what went good and what wrong with the selection. 
Obviously, there cannot be ad-hoc emails for each of the candidates. 
Some general email templates (i.e. your profile did not match the required competencies or your past experience is not in line with requested background etc), although in a standardized way, could help candidates understanding reasons of rejection.

"Dear colleagues,

there a two points which could be done better. 
The first time I've applied to a job, my CV was marked as ""not relevant""... I think I lost some very important time.
Second point (personaly for me) is, that I received not an appointement for an interview. I've worked already once for DepuySynthes and was there in the time of the transition from Synthes to DepuySynthes JnJ - would be a big pleasure to work for JnJ again.

I was a bit astonished about your very short answer. It took quite a while to apply especially because you only can load up one document.

"Dear  Recruitment  Dpt. 

Thanks for contacting me and take into you account my suggestions. 
I can mention a few details:
Inclusion and diversity as a part of the recruitment process. Nowadays  Spain has a strong multicultural influence.   Many retired people from Scandinavian and UK   countries live in costa del sol. Many children with  Latin-American background  Live in Spain. Therefore the  Recruitment Dpt.  can ask to those  candidate to  mention for example about their background, and  nationality. Where the candidates  come from?  for example:  external, internal  etc. In that way the organization can measure how inclusive is being the recruitment process and how the equal opportunities is being applied at Johnson & Johnson Spain. 

Johnson & Johnson can appoint for a interview to those candidates who want to work and identify their personal values with the Johnson &  Johnson's Mission. 
Johnson and Johnson is a leader   in manufacturing   products to  child care  and skin care across the world. People who want to join to Johnson &Johnson Must demonstrate their  skills  to work with care products: skin care , hygienic. 

Every post should   aim to   meet the   right candidates according to the Johnsons & Johnson values  and business philosophy.  
Johnson and Johnson is a leader producer in  protection products for teeth hygienic. The recruitment Dpt. should make small filters, for example prepare multi choice short-answer  to know how much the candidates know about Johnson and Johnson Organization. 

Thanks very much  in advance .

"Believing that Johnson & Johnson wants to improve itself but it's also worried about the ones who apply for their opportunities a little feedback about why you was or wasn't selected, in my opinion, would help the way we appliers see the company but show some respect for us that are trying to be part of the company.

"Being motivated upon reading the job opening, I enthusiasticly applied for the job.

Unfortunately, I have been ringfenced by LifeScan just after my application resulting in no moves possible within J&J until further notice and automatic withdrawal of my application as a consequence. Nevertheless, I kept/keep on receiving automatic mails (e;g. ""you have withdrawn your application"", ""new job openings within J&J"" and this mail) 

Rather painful I must say on top of the fact that being ringfenced is already morally hard and not motivating at all.

I would strongly recommend to please adapt your automated processes also accordingly. 

Thanks.

Basically all the major points have already covered in the JD. Will be great if work hierarchy is mentioned.

Give feedback on status of application review; more then just an automated receipt confirmation."
"Avoir une réponse sur notre candidature, qu'elle soit positive ou négative."
"Avoir la possibilité en tant que candidat de vérifier le statut électronique de la candidature pour connaître l'état d'avancement et savoir si celle ci est en cours d'analyse, a été retenue ou non"
Automatic reaction to position reaction is fine but I would appreciate more human attitude - let say to get another personal reaction from HR with existing person responsible for recruitment.
"At this stage it is hard to tell - as my experience is limited only to submitting application for this position. I received one e-mail (on April 28, 2017) informing that the next steps for external talent pool will take płace after 2-3 weeks, needed for evaluation of internal talents. I find it very fair and not very common practice - but highly appreciate keeping the candidates informed about the process. But as the next steps in the process have not yet taken place I cannot provide more input to improve the recruitment process. I would like to share my experience with recruitment process once it is finished."
At this stage I don't have any suggestion. 
"At this point, the process seems to be ok. It is a bit early though to give a complete answer on this question after just 1 mail and no real conversation yet.

"At this point, I think, I need more information to provide eligible answer."
At this point i dont know much about the recruitment process of J&J as i have only applied for job. After being selected or going through the recruitment process i will be able to give my views more positively. However till now prompt response from J&J is positive and encouraging. 
"At this point I am very happy with the recruitment process. The only thing I would suggest is to give a possible time frame for which an applicant can expect to hear back about the application, whether it is good news or bad."
At this moment recruitment process is clear. 
"At this moment I have only applied for the job online, which was an easy and intuitive process. Thank you. "
"At this moment i don't have knowledge about Johnson & Johnson complete recruitment process.
In conclusion i cannot tell what needs to be improved."
At this level the recruitment  is simple. 
At the time being the recruitment process in Johnson & Johnson is clear transparent and honest. People I met were friendly and professional. Concerning improvement I would say it is good enough. No extra efforts are needed.
"At the tender in my opinion it is important to know the candidates personally. Questionnaires can not accurately portray his personality.
Thank you for the opportunity to express themselves and have a good day."
"At the moment, there is everything okay. So, I am looking forward to hear some news frim you in order to participate in further steps."

At the moment I do not have comments. 
"At the moment everything is fine, no need to change anything."
"at least respond to application, previous one I had a good response on from J&J but this application response was very poor."

"Assessment Centre group exercise was a little too large, resulting in what I feel provided a poor representation of the true team skills different individuals had to offer. "
Asking severalizing questions
Ask to add resume at first application.
"Ask the candidate to answer specific questions directly related to the role so as to ensure that they possess the requisite minimum skills prior to submission of the application. This is mutually beneficial as it allows the recruiter to expedite the initial selection process, as well as informing the candidate in real time about the suitability of their qualifications for the role."
Ask minus information initially
"Aside from the obvious of giving me the job :)?
I think the process could be speeded up, offer more face to face interviews as this is the stage when people can truly be assessed.  Replace 'categorised' questions that only allow a certin answer group, make it possible to elaborate on answers.
On the whole though, an excellent process.
"
"As you hopefully can understand, it's not a very pleasant experience not being chosen for an interview and then being asked by the same company who turned you down for a favor in filling out a survey. Also, ""We'd like to hear from you"" is an incredibly misleading and frustrating subject line to receive from ""Talent Acquisition""... thought I was being asked to interview.

I appreciate the spirit of improvement for the candidacy process, but please, for the good of the applicants and also for your own good, try to address these issues and concerns. 

Note: disregard my above answers. I simply put the average answer as a default, rather than spending time to actually answer them."
"As there is always room for improvement, therefore, fastening the hiring process would be really good. "
"As the process did not move to the next stage due to difference with my salary expectation, would recommend to indicate the salary being offered or at least the range in the job details as that will assist potential candidate to decide before putting in the application.

"As the company receive lots of CVs for each vacancy, I believe that phone screening for current opportunities and building resume data base for future opportunities will add to the recruitment process."
"As soon as possible to review the CV of candidate, who was suggested by staff of J&J. And make interview with candidate by skype or face to face))))"
As per my knowledge this is one of the well established company in the markets where i have lived. so the brand image created by you through your employees is wonderful. as till now you have been successful in bringing best out of your employees through your existing line of recruiting methods. i guess you could try adding me in your list of good employees as i am a confident and well working individual who will be delighted to work in your company.
As per my experience i can tell nothing more can be added to the current practise 
"as of now, as a young and motivated person in this field, my personal view is that Johnson & Johnson recruiting process is very organized and unique which makes me feel more excited and persuasive to get the job or either get into Johnson & Johnson as an employee."
"as my application was not successfull, it would be useful to know why, so that I can acquire the necessary skills/qualifications to be successfull in the future. "
"As it's the first time I have applied on your website, I don't think you have to correct something special. I mean it's clear and concise.

"
"As I was referred by a friend, I was impressed in what professional way the response was. "
"As I see it, this recruitment process would be  improved if the candidate is informed the reasons he is not chosen, in order to give the right information for te position to the recruitment/selection process. Thank you for your consideration."
"As I remember, and compared to many large companies, it was a logical & comprehensive process..!"
"As I know Johnson & Johnson Acquire talent – strategically, quickly, completely and that's the best an organization can ever do to consistently pick from the cream of the candidate crop."
"As I know company provides the following steps in requirement process: 
,,Initial screening;  Online – assessment;  1st round Interview by Program; 2nd round interview by Op Co; Internship (Optional);  F-T offer.„  
From my point of view, it looks quite complete but at same time from my perspective, requirement process could be simplify by changing the process map in some cases, for instance, to provide internship opportunities on the beginning stage,  which in my personal view ensures on the one hand candidates will express more their skills and abilities and on the other hand it saves company's financial resources partially, also influential persons will be able to see candidates personal abilities more deeply.
"
"As I have not yet recieved an answer to my application,
I am a little supprised to answer such questions.
It would make more sense after a positive interview.

Still looking foreward"
"As I don't know if my application is to be taken forward it is difficult to provide an effective response.

I am impressed to receive a questionnaire now but think it might be better at the end of the recruitment process - regardless of outcome.

Differentiate yourselves by following up with all applicants."
"As I am sure is the wish of any unsuccessful applicant it would be nice to know why I wasn't able to progress further in the application process. Undoubtedly, there are many applicants for advertised roles and unadvertised at J&J but the feedback would be invaluable to jobseekers and likely add some shine to the HR reputation at J&J. Just my $0.02. Have a great day!"
As I am just at the beginning of the process I cannot recomand anything so far - could do afterwards!
"As I am at the very beginning of the recruitment process and have only submitted my application, I believe it will not be a valid evaluation if I were to make comments about the overall recruitment process. I will be able to comment better once the process is moved further (either positive or negative). For now, I will only be able to make comments about on-line application process, which is just part of the iceberg over the water level."
"As far the application process is concerned, it would be nice to receive some feedback through mail regarding the application and some updates about the process. I have not received any information about the selection for trainee program."
"As far as the application process, it was very well done / posted and straight forward.
I still have to go through the recruitment process (If shortlisted for an interview) to have a solid answer.
"
"As far as I have reached, it has been a perfect recruitment process, foreseen that even if the profile submitted does not fit the role demanded the company has communicated it to the candidate, which is not a common practice in other enterprises."
As far as i can see the process is clear and well structured. It takes a bit long but i guess it is because of the lots of candidates which also have to be reviewed.
"As far as I believe, the recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson is among the best systems in modern days. Your uses of networking, post online and job specifications enable employees to easily access, and touch to the right position. Your ""Johnson & Johnson careers"" website gives us full image of your company, your values and impact. Your feedback with opportunity opening encourages unselected candidates to continue to develop skills and qualification to follow their desirable jobs. It helps employee like I am, who is just standing at the Application Reviewing round, keeps looking forward to join your team one day.
My suggestion is, an additional assignment or a test on required skills and languages, goes at the same time with application scanning would be a good practice in your process to not missing the right candidates.
Wishing you all the best, and I hope to be part of your team soon.
Kind regards,
My-Nhung Bui.

"As an internal candidate, I was disappointed with process communication. I was told I was being passed along to the hiring manager and that I'd passed the screening stage. I never heard anything else.

I now understand (through my own network of contacts) that an external candidate who previously worked for the hiring manager was selected for the role. I am concerned with the manner that highly-matched internal candidates were vetted or evaluated, and that concern would continue if I found myself applying for an opportunity in that group again."
"As an internal candidate the process is fine as it currently is, at least in my opinion"
"As an internal applicant, if possible, I kindly ask to receive feedback on my application, considering I had the qualifications posted in the job description."
"As an employee, a person has to communicate more than just writing e-mails, therefore my opinion is the recruitment cell of J&J could be more communicative in terms of quick telephonic discussion with candidates. I believe job seekers could explain themselves better and in more detail through speaking with them than by other means. It may also be helpful for J&J to quickly scrutinize the candidates by knowing their communication and social skills. "
As an employee at JANSSEN i see that all recruitment processes are real slow. they need to be done quicker as vacancies are holding people from doing their job correctly and delivering on time.
"As an applicant, J and J did good in recruitment procedures. I did not find any problem in this matter. Maybe as an employee in the future I may be able to correct and improve any dificiency if ever there is. "
As an applicant I would love J&J to send the main reasons for rejecting the applicant.
"As a recommendation, before submitting the application, the candidate could review it as a draft. "
"As a recent graduate, I found it difficult to find a job in the database that suited my experience but wished to apply to company anyway in case some junior position became available, thus I would have preferred an option to simply submit my details and preferred area of employment to the company in general rather than having to do so by applying for a position I didn't have a hope of getting due to the experience requirements of the job."
"As a prestigous and well -kown global company, it can find the means to get workers who have ambition, marvelous talent and motivations to work under high pressure and unity of team soul."
"As a job seeker I always find it not enough to judge candidates only using online application. However personal contact can be difficult, sometimes impossible, I think it is a way better than the written online applications that can be very misleading.

Maybe asking the candidate to record a short video answering certain questions can be a solution if a phone call or personal interview is not feasible.

Asking for a feedback is already a respectable gesture. Wish you success."
"As a Huge and Great brand to be associated with, if the reply of the Position could be reverted with a Feedback at the earliest.  "
"As a first time applicant to Johnson&Johnson, I think the process was very straightforward and user-friendly. Using multiple websites to advertise would greatly increase the pool of would-be applicants."
Arrange Skype (Video Conferencing) interview for outstation candidates.
Applying was easy and fast. I have no improvement points. My compliments.
"Applied begin of April, beside the automated mail confirmation no answer or signs of interest yet - 6 weeks after. Well, some people might think that´s disrespectful to the applicant. Seems to be typical for big pharma - being treated as a number. BUT there are others who handle it better - e.g. Bayer.
Improvements: transparency to the recruitment process, service orientation -&gt; show interest in the applicant, automated answers are ok initially but then there has to be a personal response. Competing for talents you will lose against the companies with more applicant (customer) focus."
"Application turn around time should be reduced to a maximum of 7 working days.

An option to attach a short (30 sec- 5 MB)introductory video should be explored."
"Application sent 30.03.2017 but no reply received till now 17.05.2017, so guessing I have not been approved. Feedback from JJ is something each of us applicants would appreciate."
"Application process is extremely lengthy. It should be quick. Once after application, the applicant should be informed whether he or she is successful or not. It does not make sense to hold on forever. Even after interview, it usually takes ages to get back to candidate. Also, too many redundant information are required to be filled up during application stage, which i believe is already there in CV. The process is also not fair, the HR and manager get to know candidate name and address before they select candidate for interview. It would be good if you could send just CV without any personal information to recruiter & Manager, so that they can properly evaluate candidate without any discrimination or prejudice."

Always send to candidates information about recruitment process 
Always replay back to it's job applicants.
Always provide feedback to applicants
Always listen to the applicants.
always give feedback - especially when J&J contact applicants to apply
"Although there are massive number of applicants, it would be great to ask people not to apply if there are some criteria that doesn't match with the requirements! example i am an engineer and i have a top MBA diploma from IE business school however that didn't even give me a chance there but also gave me more frustration on J&J not to consider such people!"
"Although online application can be indicative parameter to satisfy job demand, I think personal interview can make big difference, since it has been known that we are hiring based on attitude not skills, because skills can always be acquired. Figuring out a method for evaluating based on face to face interview or screening, to touch the attitude, can be wonderful.

Although I understand why the salary/package is not provided in the advert it would be beneficial to have the salary bracket included within the job details in order to determine if the job finder is near/matches what is on offer (i.e. is not over reaching or applying for a role that is a salary drop).
"Although I think case studies are a valuable tool to assess candidates, I wouldn't completely agree that the circumstances in which they are handed out in reflect the reality of a work environment. In that sense, I believe that part of the process doesn't enable a candidates true potential and/or experience. 
However, considering these are standard processes for the company, I would advise making sure that hiring managers follow certain steps in terms of explaining what it's about, what is expected, and allowing sufficient time. For example, my experience was I was given the printed case study, told I had 60min and the material I had available, and that was it. It would have added some value that at least the purpose of the case was outlined as an introduction before being left in the rool. Also, typically these type of case studies are given 90min rather than 60. "
"Although I realize it is impossible to have a detailed check of each application, I believe it is important to get to know the candidate better.

"Although I don´t have any problems understanding the English language there might by other candidates, who probably don´t understand your mails etc."
"Although an email noftification is shared, it specifies that the submission is  received and added into the data base; It would be good to inlcude also a statement that the candidate will be contacted/informed on the next step(s).

I suggest to change platform for video interview. RECrueMe works better. "
After applying continue to inform candidate status of progress recruitment
"After almost a month since I submitted my application I did not receive any response or feedback of any kind to my application. Therefore, the improvment suggestion is a no brainer: respond to applicants, any reply is better than silence.  It provides to aplicants the assurance that the company knows what it needs, that there is a coherent recruitment process and that the company respects the people as declared in the Credo."
advicing applicants whether their application were succesful or not for interviews.its very vital 
Advertise what the salary is for the role to provide a idea for candidates if it meets their salary/package expectations.
Advertise the open positions more in related field peer reviewed journals

"a) Informing the job applicant about the status of their job application (e.g. under review, successful, not successful)
b) Providing timelines for feedback i.e. if not contacted after a certain number of weeks, consider your application unsuccessful."
"A vrai dire, j'ai passé un entretien physique il y a 3 semaines et je n'ai toujours pas de retour (ou une date à laquelle je recevrai un retour) qu'il soit positif ou négatif. Bien que je suis consciente qu'il y a d'autres candidats, cette situation n'est pas évidente à vivre."
A timeline should be given for the applicant to receive the feedback of their application. I haven't heard from J&J since the time I applied. There should be a clear rejection communication sent as well.
a survey is a good approach to improve
"A specialist from a professional sphere should be present at the first meeting with the applicant, not only HR: that might help to make the recruitment process quicker and more efficient "
"A Skype interview will be effective to really know the competence and experience of the candidates.  
And also,  if a training  program is attached to the job opening. It's better we emphatically spell it.  This will expunge ambiguity. "
A response even when you are not selected for interview.

A preliminary short interview in French (or job description).
A personal feedback after the interview would be great
A personal contact or a helpline where you can be able to know the exact status of your job application will make the recruitment process more good
A note of a positive feedback rather: I was nicely surprised when a couple of weeks after applying for the position I received a note from the recruiter updating me on a status/timing of the project. Very professional.    
A more personalised service on recruitment rather than just a system. It's nice to get an email from a person even if it's just to say you were not successful.
"A more personalised and constructive feedback would be appreciated,  in particular with regard to the reasons to reject an application. "
A little more/quicker update. 
A HANDY RECRUITMENT TEST IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND ALLWAYS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS  TO IMPROUVE
A great process !! Maybe the session could be a little interactive and the process of selection a little helpful for deserving/right experienced candidates
"A giant company like Johnson and Johnson have improved lot eventually. I feel that this application was submitted before a two week of time as against to posting from J&J, Lot of application must flow from people on visit visa they might be in a very low aid against the visiting period. If you have a possibility to respond within a 5 to 6 working days i feel J&J wont miss the right respondent.

I feel my kind request might consider.

A bit faster feedback on career application 
A bit difficult to achieve given the number of applicants you are getting but a more personal one to one touch would be desirable. At least for the applicants that have the experience and could be considered a good fit for the position. Consider it a form of prioritizing process. 
A better follow-up after the first phone interview.

"1. It felt that the role already had a strong pool of internal applicants. Understandably whilst this is correct, not sure seeking external applicants without them knowing about that this role may have preferred applicants, is most appropriate. I think adding a line that this role is also open to internal applicants, or there are already preferred applicants, helps.

2.  I feel there was not enough room to expand on my skills, knowledge and experience. The only attachment I could possibly do was my CV.  A section dedicated to applicant's skills and experience (as well as conformity to, and compliance with, the job description and person specification) would certainly help.

"&gt; the first 2 interviews were quickly organised (1st interview by telephone with a recruiter). To my opinion she did a great job. Within 1 week I got the invitation for the second interview in Groningen (the Netherlands). This was also a good conversation/interview to my opinion.
&gt; Next it became silent for many weeks. After 3,5-4 weeks I sent an E-mail that I was curious if there would come a next step in my procedure or not. Within 2 hours I heard by telephone from the recruiter that the manager from the 2nd interview at Medical Optics Groningen (NL) had a good impression of me during the interview but was afraid that I would not be able to tell the difference between major and minor issues. That was the reason to stop with the procedure. This all gave me a very bad feeling: it seems they forgot me to inform and the reason is really 'nonsense': I have got a Master Degree in Manufacturing Engineering, I'm analytical and conceptually very strong, psychological tests show a score above average academic level, I have been functioning very well for 9 years in Management Teams of multinationals, etc. and than I would not be able to tell the difference between major and minor  issues.

By doing this, the candidate will knows whether it’s worth applying for the job and there is no misunderstanding about what the role involves.
A good recruitment strategy needs is the right team to handle the hiring process. Whether you have a whole department that oversees recruiting or just one HR staff member who handles everything, it's important that they are trained to properly handle the responsibility. Have recruiters practice their interviewing, help them refine their questions, and train them to know what to look for when interviewing potential employees. Job listings and interviews aren't just for collecting information for the company. They should also inform applicants of everything they need to know about the position, its responsibilities, and exactly what is expected of them. Applicants who know what they are agreeing to are more likely to be happy in a position, and less likely to quickly depart.
