Q10 - Do you have any additional feedback about your experience during this recruitment process?
Latin America
"Do
you have any additional feedback about your experience during this recru..."
"The slate was very weak. I believe the TA person did not well understand my requirements nor the area (this is a regional supply chain function) yet did not ask me for more details. In many instances, I had to chase her to look for the resources. At some point, I felt she wanted me to move on with the process even if the slate I interviewed did not fulfill the requirements; it seems she was more concerned with TA KPIs than with finding the best candidate for the position."
The recruiter presented a high interest to know about the kind of profile we needed to this specific R&D area. 
It is taking too long. Having only one o two hiring dates a month is an issue.
-
"The official dates to incorporate a person into the organization, should be comunicated at the beginning of the process, so candidates and reclutants are aware of these dates.

The TA person should be more engaged in identifying internal talent for the position that we are hiring, to identify as well internal potential candidates."

"It was an easy process due to the diligence, sense of urgency and the adequate support that I received from our HR department in special from our recruiter that provide to me easy and feasible task’s to filter candidates and the exact approach about our hiring requirements.
Thank you so much, it was a pleasure to do team work and collaboration with our Talent Acquisition partners.
I really appreciate!

Monica was very helpful. I had many indications for this position and she quickly interviewed and gave feedback on the candidates.
"The recruiter assigned was new in the company and this was her first experience in clinical trials area. The good news is that she understood the role requirements very fast.


. 
"
"The attitude of the recruiter was excellent. However the process took so long in spite of having the candidate identified early on.
I think the policy in LAS cluster shopuld be revised, since it would be ideal to know before the due diligence process, if the candidate will be happy or not with the offer."
My only comment its about the speed of the offer process.
Thanks for your support 
Select candidates who live on the same city where the job is located. 
I´m unsatisfied because I had to constantly push the recruiter.  I always had to call and ask if she completed any task.
"I think the recruiter could be more senior, in my case i think it was Junior , just working part of time and  more focused on search and finalize the places in acordance with the business necessity and urgency.  "
I really like the way TA orginized the candidate's pannel presentations
Excellent Support from the recruiter
"Bruno has led the recruiting process for this postion, during the primary interviews he showed impressive soft skills to promote the best environment for transparency. All candidates could feel very comfortable to deliver their presentation and answer questions. I strongly reccomend his approach and methodology for this position and similar."
"For me the process is to fast with us, the managers. Just one day to know the candidates and need to decide in the same day is too short. We need to start the process sooner in order we have a little time to think about all the candidates. It is a very long day interviewing lots of candidates ... I did not like to need to choose in the end of the day."
.
El único punto que tengo como critica es que no tuve presentacion de candidatos externos y por el tiempo que llevo la busqueda decidimos avanzar con un candidato interno.
excellente sense of urgency
Provide the candidate battery with greater opportunity
"Talent Acquisition should standardize a template for the candidates to present themselves. For a few candidates, this was not required for. "
"the same position previous recruiter was not satisfying because the process lasted around three months more without good candidates, and I had to ask the recruiter several times for followup and the dates were not reached. (for two diffent recruiters)

I asked for a second change of the recruiter and the last change was very satisfying"
"The recruiters should present a more diverse hall of candidates. All the candidates were from only 2 or 3 different colleges. Also, the candidate profiles were very similar. I think diversity in background, college experience, regions, origins and races would bring different styles, profiles and thoughts to the company. "
"Brazil's University Relations team was an incredible throughout this process, starting from the flexibility do add an extra vacancy to the already ongoing Trainee recruitment process to the support to the offer letter process, including the contribution to the dynamics and interviewing processes. The process was especially delicate considering we had a handful of great internal candidates and we ended up selecting an external one (whom we unanimously considered the best one) and Camila and Jun's partnership was crucial (I actually awarded them with an Encore for it! =)"
Initial sample of candidates could be more comprehensive.
"Great working with Maria Andrea, as usual! Thanks a million for your leadership and passion to look for the best candidates!"
"Was a very long process due to lack of authorization, we were about to lose the candidate.  And it wasn´t possible to hire her before kickoff"
.
"The Talent Acquisition did a god job and helped a lot, however the process took a very, very, very long time (4 months) because of the deadlines of the Recruitment area. "
"This process took almost 1 year in total.
We started recruiting a 25 Warehouse Coordinator and we couldn't find a candidate who fits both skills and experience with the salary offered.
We changed the band to a 26 Warehouse Supervisor so the salary wasn't an issue.
The result wasn't satisfactory, we didn't receive any candidates from september to december, when the final candidate appeared.
"
I would like to congratulate Camila Casaccia for the remarkable job.
"optimize the recruitment process understanding internal needs, provide clear picture of the recruitment process and timeliness and follow-up with the candidate."
This experience was fantastic
It was really fast. With a high team work and deep understanding of the recruitment needs for the business.
"Everything went ok up to the choice of the candidate, but once that we approved him the process of hiring took to much time, with some lack of responsiveness. At the end our candidate took one month more to start to work x other candidates that were in the same process."
"The process is too slow and complex (filling up Oursource's pages are very difficult, and easy to make mistakes)"
process was very fast and recruiter played a key role to make it happens.
"Sometimes, I could see during the various recruitment process I had opportunity to participate recently the Talent Acquisition need to know more about each R&D area to have a better initial recruitment due to get more assertive chooses for each step of the process. It was a great partnership and it´s only a point of improvement for the team. "
the sense of urgency of the T&A team has supported me on achieving the project launch date.
the T&A team has a extreme sense of urgency on providing me support.
"Resumes was not shared in advance with us. We only received it during the dynamics which turned difficult to evaluate accordingly. A good practice it would be to share it earlier.

We had to interview 100% of candidates - this makes no sense for the recruiting team. We were not able to interview candidates that we liked, and had to interview candidates with no fit at all for the position. I could see frustration from the candidates (expecting to be interviewed for another position) and for the managers as well."
I recommend a pipeline of potential interns to hire as needed and not only a full hiring process 2x a year. 
NO.
Better communication between HR and areas about process and support during the process
no thanks.
Excellent communication about candidates and schedules.  The recruitment team acted with the speed according to the needs of the area and always with the best attitude. 
Carolina Castillo was very flexible with the process changes. She had a full understanding of the requirements and was a valuable support to conclude the process in a very sucessfull way.
"I am fully satisfied with the process until the moment we needed to generate the offer.  Unfortunately, after having the candidate chosen we took a extreme large period to have the offer ready. This cost a enormous stress to ALL involved, including the managing director and other senior leaders and a risk to loose the chosen one. "
M1 position was hired under a Supervisor position in a totally different country due to a system error. System error complicated the process.
Please be aware that my assesment related to the overall process since the opening (almost 8 months) and not to the most recent team in charge.
"I found the candidate, there was no particular added value to the procees from talent acquisition."
"The position was opened for 7 months, I understand it´s not acceptable this time frame to fullfill a position."
Just could be a faster process so that we will not loose the talent for other competitor
"This process took very long (+5 months), however it was not due to TA team. This profile was quite unique, & the key highlight is that this position didn´t had a strong internal pipeline. "
"Since it was a temporal position it was particularily hard to find candidates for the recruiter. Even though the lack of applicants, I am very pleased with the selected candidate and the recruiter sense of urgency and understanding of the position."

"Do
you have any additional feedback about your experience during this recru..."
I continue to provide the candidates that are needing to be screened. Feel like they should be actively recruiting for positions and should already have a strong slate of highly qualified talentened individuals.
"Additional support is required in casting a wider net, especially when it comes to attracting field sales talent.  Posting a position is one piece of the recruitment process.  However, being able to identify and attract talent that closely matches with the position profile would provide for a greater selection of strong candidates.  The alternative would be to engage an outside recruiter to support the process from start to finish so the focus can be on identifying the very best candidate for the role."
Gary was very knowledgeable and adjusted his schedule to address any questions that I had.
I marked N/A for internal and external candidates.  I was forwarded any candidates who met the criteriia.
We are not attracting talent through recruiting.   I had to go outside recruiting and do my own recruiting to fill this position with a qualified candidate.
"Response time, at critical points of the recruiting process was far too slow. Follow-up could be improved. I really struggled with how long the process took from the time the leading candidate was selected to the time the offer was submitted."
"Vikki Berger poses great questions to indentify need and desire for each specific territory.  She takes the time to listen and from there builds a list of qualified talent to be reviewed with a team of individuals for discussion..

I enjoyed working with Vikki and look forward to her support in filling the 2 vacancies in the Miami PCP market"
The team was beyond helpful and supportive moving quickly and efficiently to help us fill this role as fast as possible! 
"More communication and transparency of the status of the recruiter's efforts is needed.  I was expecting resume summaries and notes from phone screens.  After I became worried that qualified candidates were being screened out, I asked for copies of all resumes submitted and I didn't receive them either.
"
The time lag between the verbal offer being extended and the written offer delivery (4 days) was unprofessionally long and did not create a culture of feeling valued or respect for people to a hire.  Not the experience we want for an incoming employee. 
"The worst part of the process is the posting of the new job.  In the past the ROC's have done the majority of this work, and the DM's have not had proper training to do it.  It was painful."
"Solid expereince.  A little slow, but overall ok"
"I have worked with Heather Spuhler on 3 separate job postings for my department.   Each time I have had to have my HR rep contact her after 2-3 weeks just to begin reviewing the job description/requrements.  This is not what I have experienced when working with other recruiters in the past.  Once she does make contact, she is very professional and thorough.  However when you are short staffed, time is of the essence and timeliness is key.  This is an area  in which I feel Heather could improve.  "
Christopher Slevin was awesome... Highly recommended!
"Ultimately, my role was filled with an internal candidate, rotating from the US team.  This was a perfect solution (identified through the Talent Link team), but it would have been great to identify this pathway earlier on. We originally posted externally/internally because we were told there were no local candidates available. It seems there is an opportunity to improve connections between our internal processes in the future."
"Jamie with Kelly didn't find us any viable candidates.  A bartender was submitted for the accounts payable position.  He clearly understands that his role is one that can't be eliminated.  The only reason we were able to bring Miki on is because someone internally knew of her and sent her to Kelly.  It seems unfair to have paid them for this ""service""."
I think it would be helpful to have Talent Acquisition agree to a timeline to guide the hiring process.   
Great collaboration
Feel like we often struggle to identify qualified candidates for openings.  
"The process is exceedingly slow to start.  5 days between creating the position and getting contacted by Recrutiing to start the process is unacceptable. Once Recrutiing was assigned to the position, it was processed adequately. The recruitment process was passive with very little active research, networking, or engagement with the talent community.  The Sterility Assurance Scientist position is, admittedly, uniquely challenging to find appropriate talent.  External resources should have been engaged earlier in the process if the requirements of the position were outside the core competency of the Talent Aquisition team"
Thought it went very well. Process was easy to navigate & the team communicated often and appropriately.
"Use of Linktin information to search for the best candidates ourzelves instead of waiting for the once who will react, should be a standard practice.
Look for opportunities to speed up the hiring process."
"Tremendously helpful, my recruiter, Irene Nicastro, is a superstar!"
"When I started in the industry years ago, I was given ""a chance"" to prove myself and make and show my employers I was able to do an amazing job even with my lack of experience. I like to give the same ""chance"" to candidate that have high potential. I know the recruiters have criteria that candidates have to fulfill but I wish it could be more flexible and at the manager's discretion. (Note that this comment ONLY applies to the sourcing recruiters in the US, the Canadian Talent Acquisition people are amazing in understanding what managers are looking for)"
"It was a difficult recruiting process but I think that simply reflects the high demand for the type of role I was trying to fill.  The recruiter was very good, but there are just not a lot of candidates with the skills we needed."
Proactively bring external candidates.. Now that you know the job description.. can you keep scanning external environment to build a pipeline.. especially diverse pipeline
"Great team, enjoyed working with them, very responsive"
Amy Gilland-Mitchell is the best recruiter I have worked with in my 20+ years in Sales Management with 3 different companies. I have enjoyed working with Amy on all of my hires. She is the gold standard in my opinion. 
More guidance and communications would be helpful Post Talent Acqisition (on-boarding) process for an employee and immediate supervisors.
no
Vanessa did a great job throughout this process and was extremely attentive to the needs of the process.  
"For positions on the Walmart team, since we aren't getting an internal candidates, I think we should also partner with local recruiters who specialize in this market."
"Talent acquisition team was very helpful, highly responsive through out the recruitment process. They worked closely with me to ensure we meet the recruitment timeline. They provided us candidates who were qualified to take on the role."
"after 1/2 year of search only one person qualified for in person interview, ended up with a candidate I found independently knowing the field.Recruiter was not willing to place ads in areas (webpages / scientific communities) where I wanted to pull from.

Onboarding process under the current JnJ & Abbott bi-state was and still is a nightmare. I get handed back and forth between the hotlines - noone can fix issues. I spent multiple hours per week on getting the new employee going just from my side. She spent even more time on the phone with the different hotlines. Certainly not a good start from an HR perspective. Cant image we run a business like this."
Recruiter changed mid way through the process.  Current MD recruiters are contract employees??
"Timely, friendly, collaborative!"
operate with more sense of urgency
"Tim did a great job leading the recruiting efforts, the process was efficient and timely. "
Great support especially for a new manager.
"The recruiters are great, the process is not beneficial to our timeline."
"Because my team focuses on industry specialists, I only rely on internal recruiting to manage the internal Johnson and Johnson onboarding process. "
Improve communication to  non elected candidates
"Due to the acquisition of AMO by J&J, the offer process was extremely delayed with little to no guidance from J&J and HR.  Once the offer was accepted by the new-hire, the on-boarding process has been terrible.  Weeks went by with no information on the progress of WWID or AMO UPI...I finally received J&J WWID and J&J  onboarding info but only after following the J&J directions, did I find out that it doesn't apply since we are not fully integrated with J&J yet.  I was eventually told Abbott TSA policies still apply; however, the AMO processes have failed in both timing (UPI not available until 2 days before the scheduled start date) and in gaining access to AMO applications (new employee has been here over a week and still no access to AMO servers or compliance wire for training!).  I understand that we are still in the ""transition"" period of being integrated with J&J, but the on-boarding process has been a disaster with poor communication between Abbott and J&J and little to no instruction for those of us trying to onboard new employees. "
"The on-boarding process should be explained (email or documentation is fine), as I kept wondering about when the candidate would be assigned WWIDs, when/how they would be set up, etc."
Good end result!
"In this instance, there was a very strong internal candidate that was known to me. The other candidates presented did not have desired skill set, and I cannot be sure if that was due to the pool of applicants not having the right skills or if the right candidates were not presented based on the desired skills. (I tend to think the applicants just didn't have the desired skills, and the recruiter presented the best available). Nonetheless, since I had a very strong internal candidate with the right skills, I was not too concerned about the lack of depth in the slate and I am satisfied that I was able to get the right person for the job."
Great Team to partner with!
"Christina was extremely helpful, friendly and made the process pleasurable and quick "
none
Talent Acquisition partners are excellent at J&J. Thank you for everything. 
"I think we can do better when looking for external candidate , we should be using multiple media to share the open position like Linked In groups, Indeed, Facebook Page to reach out a maximum of potential candidates."
Jen Deblasio and Venette Macalinao were excellent to work with! Thank you very much Jen and Venette.
"It is to complicated to get the process started, no feedback if the talent acquisition was requested correctly, "
Need more internal candidates. 
"The recruitment pahse works well, however, there is no good ""handoff"" to the onboarding part for the site.  "
Should screen internal candidates based on performance ratings to avoid a lot of wasted effort.
"Our recruiter is new to the company and still learning the nuanes of our program, but overall has done a good job. There are still plenty of opportunities for growth around developing a comprehensive, global strategy that is driven by insights from data. Talent Acquisition is currently operating in silos from a regional perspective, so this too needs to be addressed. On a separate but related topic, the actual candidate onboarding process (in partnership with Global Services and others) is fundamentally flawed at the moment and in serious need of fixing in order to provide a positive candidate experience. The current process is too slow, has too many handoffs, and is not meeting our program's or candidates' expectations."
Laura Green and Val Munyan were great communicators and collaborators.
Laura Green and Val Munyan have been great partners. They set up meetings to level set and communicated well through out the process.  The process went quickly as well.
Really need more qualified candidates to choose from. Our sourcing methods don't seem to be working. 
Tim and Nate were great partners throughout the process and a huge asset in helping us find the right candidate.
"Low score for internal candidates was because of this being a new type of skill to J&J and hence the need to look more externally.
Christine Orlando and her support were extremely supportive and responsive throughout the whole process"
"Recruiting over the holiday season was difficult. Getting resumes upon return in January seemed to take some time, with reminders needed."
N/a
This position seems to have caught the start-up of the new recruiting process/organization.  It was clear that the lower levels in the organization were not familiar with the offer process.  This led to multiple delays in getting an offer to the candidate.  There was also confusion regarding who should drive the overall process.  It took multiple escalations to resolve.
"There is limited understand of why we need the degrees and experience we need.  Frequently, the people we need are already working elsewhere.  We need to do more headhunting.  The highest 2 resumes came from internal referrals, and we were lucky to get them.  

The initial response from the recruiter was slow because of the move and restructuring of the recruiting group."
"Krista has been a great acquisition to the SC Recruiting Team.  Having a recruiter with some understanding of the business function they are supporting has been a key success factor versus previous associates in that role.  In addition, there has been considerable improvement in the sense of urgency and speed of execution versus previous recruiting experiences.  Lastly, the offers were error free, which was another major improvement over previous experiences.  Keep up the great work."
"This was an urgent internal-only search with a very qualified candidate already identified.  I wasn't contacted by the recruiter until a week and a half after the new position was created.  I had already spent several phone calls to AskGS without anyone being able to tell me who the recruiter was.  The Recruiter was very professional and polite, but the follow-up was slower than I would have expected and I was the one who tended to initiate any interactions.  Perhaps she was over-loaded.  All in all, not a very positive experience."
"position took a very long time to recruit
had to personally follow-up to understand if any candidates had bid on position vs. being kept informed of status"
I was not the primary contact for this slate.
None.
Very satisfied with the recruitment process
In the past I would have wished the attention to timing and detail where there.  This past hire went so much nicer then others in the past. 
Without Brian Fanus's help this req. would have not been processed.  He fixed the issue in the system and got the process moving.  
"I am satisfied with our selected candidate, however, the slate was very weak.  I would have liked to have had more viable candidates."
The upfront part of the process is still opaque. I was lucky to work with a recruiter I've worked with before. If that wasn't the case it would take a lot longer. 
very slow to move forward with issue relying on compensation and relocation
"This was a contractor that went through the sourcing process. I have no NO issues with Sourcing/Recruiting but the challenge lies in the conversion process. IT directs completely different from HR - my new hire date of Feb 13, but didn't gain access to systems, new wwid plus until March 13th. Not only does this disconnect costs him time, my time - but also impacted his ability to even access his benefits selection. Adding, the IT department also had multiple responses and answers as well...overall, an extremely frustrating event, AFTER the position was hired. "
Overall was able to have a wide variety of candidates and a clear top two.  Fortunately our top candidate is now joining our team!
Recruiter was very responsive which enabled a quick process.
The cleared for hire process should be done in a week or less would be preferred .
Make sure offer letter is correct prior to sending 
"The candidate we hired was an internal referral, the pool was very limited from the recruiter. It was also inconsistent with previous experience in the communication between myself and the candidates. "
"HR is one of the weakest link in this organization.  The support I received from HR was almost zero.  I needed to completely waste hours, when a simple call with the HR rep could have been sufficient.  The ""self-service"" HR approach is a total disaster.  Doesn't this company ever hold senior leadership, responsible for these enormous failures, accountable?  It doesn't seem so, from my perspective of 11 yrs in the company."
Great communication good pool of resumes solutions oriented
"The merit increase timing caused us a very long delay in getting an offer communicated, and I do not agree it had to be so.  This process makes our company look incompetent and slow moving.  I don't think it makes a very good impression on candidates."
I found it very difficult to get the offer out to an internal employee. It often takes longer to get offer letters to internal vs external candidates. I have hired 6 people in the past year and this is most often the largest obstacle in hiring.
Excellent Job!
"We had a agreement to contact the candidates that were not selected to the job after we presented the offer to the selected candidate. They were not contacted at that time. We learned about it because one candidate contacted us requesting information on the job. In addition, an internal candidate that was not selected for interviews was not contacted either.  "
The offer simply took a bit longer than I expected but I understand it has been busy.
Jackie Cogan did a terrific job helping me with this.
I was quite surprised that I had to schedule the interviews as I feel this should be the responsibility of the recruiter or HR.
J&J has a hard time getting offers extended to internal candidates in a timely fashion when we are in the compensation increase time window.  We need to solve this.
This successful candidate was identified by the business unit and not by internal recruiting.
None
It took almost four months from the time I initiated the request to my selected candidate starting the job. I would like to see the time lag shortened.
Scott Foley and team did a nice job as usual.  Very professional and managed well.
"Brittany Cooney is AMAZING.  I am very honest in feedback and usually don't give top scores across the board, but this is my second hire with Brittany and she was every bit as responsive, thorough and collaborative this time as she was on my first hire with her. This is a HUGE improvement over our prior process.  "
"My experience with Talent Acquisition at Johnson and Johnson has been extremely disappointing so far.

I have been through seven different recruiters in succession in the past year. Several have left my roles they have been recruiting for with absolutely no notice (""Today is my last day at J&J ...""

None have demonstrated that they have a command of the roles that I am looking for. And they have never responded to emails in a prompt way. In my estimation, and my manager's, this is an ""outage"" at the company. I have solved for it by bringing outside recruiting firms for roles, but working with this department has been one of the biggest outages since I arrived.



"
I thought the process was efficient and ran smoothly
Amy Gilland-Mitchell is extremely organized and responsive.  I always get great candidates from her.  She is the best I have dealt with in my 20 years as a hiring manager.
Brian fixed my issues with the recruiting quickly.  Nick provided candidates in a timely manner  They were both great to work with.
Lisa was a great partner. I hope we are as successful with filling the other roles.
"Tami Dwinell-Nisbit handled most my recruting and did an outstanding job.  Sense of urgency, problems solving, following through on comittments, advising and helping shape decisions.

Worked with Vikki Berger on LA opening and she was also terrific."
"In general, I was pretty happy with my assigned recruiter.  If you guys could figure out a more formal/standardized way to help us hiring managers keep track of the many candidates, that would be a great service.  Perhaps a tracking sheet that is kept in a shared location where both the recruiter and the hiring manager can add notes, pros/cons, log of when the candidate was contacted, why rejected or moved to the next phase, etc."
"feedback was very inconsistent, I provided the largest majority of candidates, there was little screening completed, the timelines outlined were not followed. Not sure there is value in recruiting versus allowing us to complete it."
Very positive. Recruiters would keep me in the loop 
Used an external firm (Spencer Stuart) and it was CRITICAL in sourcing top (and diverse) talent from within Silicon Valley.
The person I hired required an international move and the recruiter was not informed of the process. She learned real time as I did about what was required.  The Talent Mobility resource was very helpful to us both.  
Very helpful recruitment team.  Was able to come up with new approaches for additional candidates.
Scott foley was outstanding and provided appropriate support and guidance.
The hand-off from talent acquisition to on-boarding was a little rough.  We made it through though.
"I encountered one issue with the recruiter.  we had designated a specific posting duration.   at the end of the designated posting period, I received a slate of candidates.  Through sources, it came to my attention that the posting was still open, and a second slate of resumes was available.  By this time, interviews on the first slate were nearly complete and we were ready to make decisions.   This error was of no fault of the second set of candidates.   While we did not require more candidates, it was not fair to this set of candidates.  We hurriedly put interviews on the calendar and talked with those candidates.  The conversations were good, but our best candidates were in that first group of resumes.  This error caused us some delay and put us in an ackward position to interview candidates in a hurried fashion."
"I am happy with our candidate.  While everyone in the process is friendly an professional, I do think there is a lack of understanding of the role and responsibilities when it comes to filling a nurse position. The difference between an LPN and an RN and understanding types of nursing.  I was hired almost two years ago, and I remember the recruiter was unable to answer many of my questions about the role in the screening process. Prior to this position, I hired a casual part time nurse and currently am looking for another Site Lead. I would be happy to work with recruiting to improve the understanding of our role, places to look for nurses and questions to ask in the screening process. I found I had to follow up frequently, and felt as if I was expected to find the person as this was outside the traditional positions you are looking for.  With the Sr OHN position, there was a problem where my location was changed somehow from Raynham to Ft Washington and it messed things up for awhile.  I was assured it was nothing I could have changed but it took a bit to correct that.  Thank you. Again, I am happy to help with understand the GHS roles."
Talent Acquisition at JnJ has not yet provided a candidate that has been hired by our franchise.  We have a very unique role in the JnJ Family and it is extremely hard to fill.  Candidates are few and far between
Very responsive and professional!
This was an easy to fill slot due to living in the territory and knowing my potential candidate pool.
No
"The problem was that we were kept in the unkown first because of response time based on the criticality of the position and then because of the frozen hiring state. However, we are happy that ones this was clear the following steps and responses were extremely positiv. We also appreciated to clarity on the situation we were facing end of the year."
"The recruiter did a great job, extremely satisfied for recruiting effort.  The offer process received lower scores due to the inability to make an offer due to holds late last year.  During the delay we lost 2 of the leading candidates to other positions outside of J & J. "
"there was a lot of problems in the final offer letter.  the notification was sent to a wrong person and even after many follow ups, we could not figure out that the offer was sent to the wrong person within JnJ.  "
none
on-site recruiter (Steve Higginbotham) was very helpful - recruiting assistance with posting was slow and not proactively responsive.  
"We almost lost the candidate we wanted due to the interactions of the recruiter with the candidate. Had the hiring manager (me) not had a previous personal relationship with the candidate, then they would not have continued with the process."
"Great experience - huge fan of Tim Grimes.  Great add to our organization.  Pleasure working with him - great action orientation & responsiveness, and great help evaluating talent."
"Increased communication around completion of pre-screening, hire dates and other recruiting related tasks.
"
"This was a position for which he had limited or no internal candidates, because it is a new area for the company.  Our recruiting group did a great job understanding the role, impact tot he business, and helping source external candidates."

Asia Pacific
"Do
you have any additional feedback about your experience during this recru..."
Proactive searching & building network with potential external talents are important to plan external hiring ahead
Inventory of resumes for the role could be a help.
"There is no formal process of carrying out the recruitments which should be available.
During the interviews the technical competency is assessed by the interviewer.But there should be second level of assessment also.
HR interview should play an important role in the recruitment process which is currently very much lacking.It should be face to face and focussed in understanding the person.

"
This was an internal transfer which didn't really require any expertise from the recruiter
Vicky Hsaio is an exceptional TA partner.  I wish I had the same experience in other markets I recruit in.
"Need better coordination within the HR function - handover from TA to TR, BUHR is not smooth and the issuance of an offer letter took 2 weeks after giving the green light to offer.

Since the hiring for a legal counsel does not take place that often, bringing TA team up to speed and build market knowledge might be inefficient."
"Because we rely on different functional capabilities to tackle issues, there is a struggle in resolving these that led to oftentimes a feeling of ""who could help me on that""! I am sure there is a manual of steps on ""how to go through recruitment"", I just must have missed this one. "
"The candidates put forward through on-line application and remote screening were not good fit for the role.
"
"I had to be myself chasing the recruiter some times to provide feedback to the candidates that they were not selected for the following phase.  It also took more time than expected to set up interviews etc.  When it came to offer time, the more senior TA colleague got involved which was very helpful but it is still took in total too long to be ready with an offer.  He was very good though in talking to the candidate and in negotiating with him ending with a reasonable offer both for the candidate and J&J.  "

We had to go to an external talent agency to find suitable candidates

Once we engaged with external recruiter the process sped up
"connecting to the team is extremely tough. they behave like very high level boss and max time dont available in phone. dont get any reply in SMS. i need to request my boss to contact and allow me to know the status.

the quality of candiadtes CVs ( given by the team ) is very low and max time dont match our criteria. "
"We did not have any internal candidates for this role so I wonder whether we are exploring all possible means of promoting available jobs internally?  Looking at China's 10,000 strong employee base, I found it unusual not to have a single person in the company interested in a Senior Manager role such as this."
HR to acquire more CVs of candidates for similar role.
"External CV received were extremely good , purely because the recruiter clearly understood the requirement . "
"It was a hard process, as you took over mid process. But the communication could definitely improve, we agreed on a weekly catch up , but that didn't happen, I needed to chase regularly . The process was very hit and miss"
"The onboarding process was very slow and disjointed.  The candidate ""start date"" had to be changed two times due to onboarding delays for pre-screening and all of the complex steps in between.   I was often not very well informed as to what was going on or why there were delays."
The requisition process from the beginning is not so clear. I do not know what happened to my requisition in workday. I still need to follow-up and know where it is. I don't  know who needs to approve it or if there is an approval needed in the first place.
NO
Rien a dire!!!
QS position is difficult to looking for the passionate person. 
Sincerely appreciate the recruiter acting quickly to help convert existing contractor to FT under time pressure/ tight timeline. Excellent work to expedite the elements of the process that could be completed in a dual path/more efficient manner.
"I did not get any good candidates for this position from HR. The respond for this was very slow. The only candidate we interviewed and hired was got from the talent market... However, this guy finally rejected this offer after requesting for postponing twice...
The respond of getting new candidates was very slow again. I finally got a good candidate last Friday, hopefully he'll make it...  "

"Highly disappointed with the experience of using the Talent Acquisitions Team. The lack of communication was extremely frustrating. The external candidates given for review were limited and struggled to meet key requirements of the role. Constant chasing for updates and progress became disheartening and frustrating.

Once a internal candidate was chosen for the position, the lack of urgency by talent acquisitions team was very frustrating, taking over two weeks to align on a package and taking numerous meetings to get an alignment.

My experience of this process questions the visibility of this team within the NZ market, the mediums used to attract quality candidates, the quality of the interaction to internal and external candidates and the ability to sell candidates on joining JNJ.

"the candidate rejected th offer finally, it's still in requit process for this position. We hope we can get more option for the candidate."
I would have appreciated seeing the results of the testing and the letter of offer before it was given to the new candidate. 
Improve quality of notes from screening interviews. Add situational interviews at the level of manager and up.

Cross country internal transfer is too costly going through global mobility
"1) Quality of resume needs to be validated and a telecon with the RSM is essential within 1-2 days of Taleo update.
2) TOT for resume should not be more than 3-5 days.
3) Reminders for resume should not be encouraged. 
4) Inventory of resumes should be encouraged for every HQ that is vacancy proned. 
"
The role that Global Services play in churning out the offer letter takes way too long. Their collaboration with HR/TA team is also slow and cumbersome which impacted the issuance of the offer letter. Also details of start date was communicated wrongly which showed their inability to garner simple instructions. Hopefully as time goes on this process will improve so that the hiring of people is much smoother than what it is right now.  
I felt that the recruitment process was a little bit longer than I expected.  This led to the post kept vacant for 6 months.  It is good if we can shorten this process to minimize the impact to the team
"if we could have more shortlist candidate, we could speed up the hiring"
The process with Global Services to get the letter of offer to the candidates takes forever. The process is really slow and cumbersome and all these red tape need to be removed. I would expect that once we are ready to hire a person that the process will not take more than 1 week to get everything finalized but close to 1 1/2 months of waiting is way too much and very frustrating and it affects the team as a whole. This process needs to be quicker and much more smoother for J&J to move to the next level of excellent recruitment processing.

"Do

everything was OK
"TA didnt listen when I said I didnt need initial 1:1 meetings sorted. I was happy to do myself, but TA went ahead anyway (tick box mentality)

Email to unsuccesful candidates (internal) were very poor and would affect our ability to retain staff in my opinion"
Many thanks to Carola Griesshaber :-)
it was really great to work with Ivana Reiter on this hire and I do want to thank her very much. it was not easy as it was for a regional role and additionally to the great support and her professionalism she also put a lot of effort in to understand and align with the processes of the final location of the new hire. I do want to mention that also the support of her partner in the UK Hollie Valler was great. thanks to both!
A lot of communication from the recruiter bypassed me and went to my manager instead. I would have preferred to be included in the communication.
"Mylene Paumier was amazing for the recruitment of this role which ended up being 2 roles due to the evolution of the team.  I would like ot ensure she gets appropriate recognition for her excellent work considering she hersefl is a recent hire to J&J.  Compared to my past experience with TA (specifically Lissa Gomm) Mylene has far and away exceeded expectations.  Her responsiveness, sense of urgency, attention to detail, flexibility and ability to offer deep insights from her screening with candidates was very appreciated.  "
"It seems that most of provided cv-s by Recruter were people interest of the vacancy published through external resource. I would also expect the scan by Recruter of external resources for opened CV-s. The amount of candidates in this process was not that high, we just found the good one quite quickly."
"Melanie did not get off to the best start but she is VERY capable and a strong talent acquisition partner. I would use her again if I had a choice. 

This was a tough placement for lots of reasons.

"
First attempt to use this service and found it met all expectations. Very pleased with the assistance given. 
"It all takes too long, the recruiter are overloaded."
"Elise communicated with me on a regular basis, she is very professionnal and detailed in her reporting"
"There is not a slate in place for MAF nor for QA,PV RA profiles.
This should be top priority for the LT of HR especially for MAF and HEMAR. Even though TRANSFORM was rolled out this is still not in place !"
"At the beginning, due to the workload of the Talent aacquisition team it seemed this process could be delayed but finally it went extremelly well. The candidate already started and she is perfect!!"
Delay in response and small pool of candidates suitable was presented.
"woud be nice if the recruiter, me, can receive easily all cv received on the portal by spontaneous candidates, without always ask to talent acquisition. and the way to extract all the CV seems to be very complicated so probably to simplify it will help to share quickly the info between recruiter and talent acquisition.
"
"A more proactive approach will be highly appreciated in the future.The follow-up after a certain  action has to be done by default and not only by request.
The level of responsiveness shall increase; usually the hiring person needs to fill the vacancy as soon as possible!
Thank you for all the support provided so far! "
slow process 
"we got a very good slate for this role, I am pleased with the work done"
Thank you
Au vu de l'urgence dui recrutement le processus a été trop long et peu de réactivité
I would like to thank you very much for supporting the bussiness with this professional atitude 
handover to other countries within JnJ is not seamless or not really clear -&gt; not really a regional organisation. f2f interviews in Diegem have been organized out of UK which is rather difficult. at the day of the f2f interviews nobody from HR or TA were available to support
No feedback to applicants during the different interview stages. It took a couple of months until an applicant heard back from us and that is not acceptable in my view.
"The overall orocess took too long. Fron receipt of the previous persons 2 weeks notice, it took 10 weeks before I had the person start with me. And then I had to train them. We need to shorten this time considerably."
No

"The process was to long to start the interview, but once started, the tempo was good"
"none., appreciate the follow up, and drive"
The low rate is exclusively due to the low speed of this process.
I'd like to special thank you for Senior Talent Acquisition Partnerin in Turkey.
"No proactive action.
CV's only arrived 2 hours before interview.
Candidates complained of lack of communication"
Very well done! :)
.
"I think that Talent Acquisition team has a very good understanding of the job market, how to approach the candidates, they used wide range of modern tools. They also understand very well the profile of the persons we need. 
The problem is responsiveness, the quality of the candidates and the number of candidates. I understand that this can be caused by the difficult situation on the market. "
TA and HR should not interfere and conflict each other while preparing the offer for the candidate. It should be the hiring manager and TA only!
"Great job, thanks for the support!"
Thanks for the great support!
"I felt that I had to drive the process to get a result, for example I had to reach out for list of candidates who applied. I would have expected HR to forward them as soon as they come in, which would allow me to respond quickly if candidate was strong, its a very difficult market out there for Automation Engineers. We need to be proactive to get the best engineers."
very positive feedback  regarding speedy process  
we got excellent support for our business
Cast net wider internally first; ahead of external hire. Have a pipe-line of internal talent
I did all of the follow up.  I had to ask for the list of applicants.  It took so long I started my interviews before the recruiter.  There does not seem to be any real committment to service.  
"I have a very good feedback about the proces with the last recruiter. 


However during the 1rst phase of recruitement, the first recruiter was not supportive.
No value proposal, not enought  support .
"
TA was a good listener and pretty reactive by email. However I found sometimes that the candidates suggested by TA were not relevant. I think going forward a primarly screening stage would help to ensure the profile of the candidate meets the requirements for the role.
.
I love working with Pascal! He knows exactly what I needs and supports me as I need! Tge recrutings we did together turned out great! Thank you!

"Matt Peacock did an amazing job in building a database of potential external hires. He proactively sourced the successful candidate and kept her ""warm"" even though we had to put the offer on hold for 2 months owing to the recruitment freeze in Q4.
The slow final offer was not Matt's fault but due to the HR team in Switzerland who put up multiple barriers to hiring this top talent.
Whilst Matt is a superb TA partner, his focus is UK and for EMEA roles there is a requirement for a TA co-ordination role as it is very difficult to reach out to multiple TA partners"
"recruitement process worked fast and efficient, good support "
"Very efficient process, continous learning from different perspectives (recruitiing versus technical SMEs perspective, questioning techniques, transparency in decision making process was highly appreciated either way, very engaged and competent recruiting business partner"
"Need more collaboration on the University Hire Program as a whole, not just job-specific and once a year."
Tracy McKenzie has been fantastic and I'm very grateful to her.
A du faire appel à un prestataire pour que cela débouche - candidat recruté aprés 5 mois
pas de candidat retenu à ce jour .. 
No.
"I lost a very good candidate because of the lack of responsiveness of the recruitment team. I'm still not sure as of today the candidate identified will actually join my team (she was supposed to start last week but has still no contract, more than a month after she accepted our offer)"
I had to constantly chase TA for updates and often found that I had to actively drive the process and in some cases speed it up. I ended up having weekly calls with the recruiter directly to progress the process.
"There was only one internal candidate. I think in this case there was more ""overhead"" then necessary. "
Great work!!! Survey is too long!
"Current talent acquisition process has some major gaps:
- it consists of  posting the job and waiting the reply.
- There is no pro-activity in understanding the market, reaching out to talent pool, database of people by qualification, etc etc.
- When the recruiter interview the candidates, there is no formal, structured and  standardized feedback.
- There is major difference between recruiter seniority and candidate seniority in many cases.
- Talent acquisition - in my experience - is not set-up as a strong partner to identify, assess, attract candidates but is 80% transactional/admin work.
- This is currently one of the major gap in our ability to build strong organization and be competitive against the our big competitors.

"
There was lots of confusion around reporting structure and who was managing the placement.  Lots of communication to the wrong people. I had opened the req but no one connected the dots that I had a placement - seems like the workday process still has a lot of gaps/miscommunication. 
The recruitment process has become too formalised and can take too long and cost too much if only one candidate is being hited.
provided already to the HR director
"- TA is still mixing ""Compliance"" in general and ""Finance Compliance""
- I haven't seen any good CV except of the person we hired at the end (the person was recommended by a team member)"
my collaboration with Talent Acquisition was clearly improve since my business partner is Elise Alimondo dur to her quality to understand business needs and the quality of her feedbacks after interviews
"Une fois le process finalisé, il faudrait que les demandeurs recoivent une confirmation de l'embauche (postdoc , stagiaire, CDI) par mail une ou deux semaines avant que le candidat se présente à son poste de travail."
"Working with Carola Griesshaber is a great pleasure, thank you!!!"
"The interview process was strong. 
Alot of follow up was required in order to obtain basic information on the hiring process. Prompts were required at alot of steps to request feedback, sometimes more than once. 
I would like to see the process flow more smoothly with regular updates to the hiring manager. "
The TA team weren't involved in the initial recruitment of this candidate as I had sourced him internally.
"For me it is important that the recruiter is personally on site for the interviews with the canditates, because so I can benefite from his experience!
For me interviews are the most important step in a recruitment so for me it is not an option to do it per video or WebEx Conference!"
I needed to recruit quickly and was fully supported all the way. Thank you!
more speed and having more good talents 
"The Talent  Recruiter who I dealt with,   was extremely professional and follow through excellently with all requests."
"Matthew is a quiet, unassuming superstar that simply gets the job done well.
No fuss
No histrionics
No hassle
Just results on time."
"I think the candidate is perfect fit to the role.  but the role requires continuity. so the candidate should be proper for continiuos jobs. the chooden candidate, took a sick leave in the first day of the job. the duration is 4 -5 weeks and I do not know how will we manage this kind of situations. :( skills of the candidate is proper for possition but I think we should check her continuity before hiring and HR partner should be checked it before we hire. if she is not proper to continue to job , maybe she is not as proper as we think in the begining. "
The process for the candidates who get a regret could be more clearly defined. This is specificaly regarding the responsibilities who is doing what.
"Karolien did a great job in recruiting for my open position in Beerse.  She was very responsive, easy to work with and really understood the process and the CSC team."
Was provided in my previous survey. 
"Compte tenu du volume de nouveaux entrants liés à Transformation, l'essentiel des tâches a incombé aux Directeurs Régionaux (recherche de candidats, premier entretien).
Débordé par l'ampleur de la tâche, le service Talent Acquisition n'est intervenu que pour valider les candidats pré-sélectionnés.
Certes des CV nous ont bien été adressé mais peu en lien avec mes attentes.
Des discussions certes constructives mais chronophages ont été nécessaires pour bien faire comprendre les besoins et les enjeux de nos métiers.
Enfin une fois le processus de sélection terminé le délai particulièrement long et laborieux avant d'aboutir au recrutement définitif des candidats."
