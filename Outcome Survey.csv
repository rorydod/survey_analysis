Q6 - What can Johnson & Johnson do to improve the recruitment process?
What can Johnson & Johnson do to improve the recruitment process?
"This was probably a bad example for a survey. The position was put on hold and I have not received any updates. Based on the survey and the question - ""Did the recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to?"" I am only guessing the position was closed? Again, the communication for this one has been extremely poor and my opinion of the process is therefore not favorable.  "
"My rate (7) about how I view J&J is strictly related to the way the recruitment process has been handled. I consider J&J  a great place to work at and I will love to work for J&J.
I am disappointed when I receive standard messages (fired by a system) informing that I have not been considered for the position, without no explanation whatsoever, except with the ""usual"" note that a candidate better meeting the requirements has been found. Although I understand the challenges and reasons for that, I consider this practice not respectful for candidates. If you want to improve the recruitment process and increase even further your well-respected popularity and, let me say, brand please abandon the ATS platforms and have recruiters/HR people inform candidates about the results of their applications, whatever it is. "
"Provide specifics as to why I was not a fit for the role, or provide feedback on what improvements would strengthen my candidacy.
"
Have some psychometric test and Case studies at the time of interviews.
I think the process is good enough.
"Dear talent acquisition,

I have applied for several positions at JnJ and received many rejection emails without any feedback. I would welcome some feedback or guidance to make the decision as whether I should continue perusing a career at JnJ or concentrate my effort on other companies. Thank you for your attention.

Regards, "
"FYI - I never received any direct contact regarding my application - no assessment, interview or feedback on my application.  This is the second survey I have received.  "
deliver timely feedback
Should evaluate the personality and not only the current skills of each potential employee.
The company should contact every potencial candidate with specific reason why they are not selected in the process.
Faster process time and follow through. 
i am not clear why i  got this mail .... i have already been recruited and very much in to the system from 7 months ....why this mail then
Doing both of the things you mentioned in this survey (providing a reason and an invitation to join the talent community) would be great.  Instead I received a very generic email.
"I was never contacted by anyone about the position. I'm a talented representative happy with my current position and I'm very good at my job in the biologic space. However, I'd like to move back home and your company missed out on a great  employee by not giving me a second glance. "
Be more open
"You can stop using computer generated screening tools and filter through some of your better candidates who have way more experience to add to your organization than someone who may be forging a resume to slip through a computer based screener.  Happy to discuss in person, but seemingly will not be given that chance."
"Johnson & Johnson at least took the time to let me know I was not selected for the position I was applying to.  Many other organizations do not take that into consideration for their recruitment process.

"
"
- The hiring manager or recruiter need to provide feedback on why the candidate was not selected

- The interview was poorly prepared, I only interviewed with one manager, however, similar companies as J&J tend to have a interview panel to reduce any bias, plus the interviewee gets to meet with managers and executives"
I felt it was an unreasonable amount of time to tell me I was not being considered.  I think communicating in a more timely manner would be better for applicants so they are not sitting around wondering what is going on.
General feedback and reason why you were not a good fit.
"I think the recruitment process at J&J is not as good as it could be.  The recruitment team seems very keen to place a square peg in a square hole.  I am very keen to join J&J and been willing to lower my salary expectations to broaden my experience and work in Johnson and Johnson to experience working in a different type of role or gain different experience.  Looking through the company's credo I would have thought J&J would be open to an application on this basis but from my experience of the UK recruitment team this does not seem to be the case; they have told me in the past that I am ""over qualified"" based on my previous salary, rather than my previous experience. I did really want to work with J&J on the basis of the company's ethos and credo but I can see from my personal experience that the recruitment team and hiring managers are more concerned with hiring someone who ticks the right boxes to make sure that their backs are covered, which basically shows me that J&J is not the employer I thought they were.  I may still pursue a career at J&J but I will be pursuing opportunities on an opportunistic basis rather than as an employer of choice, which was previously the case."
"Put more professional, puntcual recruiter in the recruitment process"
.
"Congrats.
"
Never was called for the interview
"Pertaining to the first question of this survey - the regrets letter was vague and short and though I appreciated the notification that I did not advance in the hiring process, the reason why I was passed over was not specifically mentioned. "
"Pertaining to the first question of this survey - the regrets letter was vague and short and though I appreciated the notification that I did not advance in the hiring process, the reason why I was passed over was not specifically mentioned. "
"To give the candidate an opportunity, I have already applied for several positions and at no time did I have a return of the company to proceed with one of the processes. I believe I have a good resume and I am discouraged to receive only search emails and have some email that Johnson & Johnson sends that seems to have participated in some other aspect of the process without this happening, I also see as a positive aspect of Company give us a position, but it would be cool if the company goes down a greater opening to meet the candidate."

"Better communication with qualified candidates.  As an example, I am more than qualified for the position, and was most likely among the very top candidates with respect to overall experience, broad based and deep capital markets knowledge, and strategic thinking.  I certainly expected that I would be brought in for an interview, but receiving zero feedback was puzzling.

I believe J&J is a great firm, and seems to also be a terrific place to work.  The fact that you ask for this kind of feedback in this survey is admirable and sets the company apart from many a mediocre operation.  
"
no reply.......
Provide reasons of exclusion
"To improve the recruitment process is a difficult task, I supppose that everything is fine. It may be some surveys for appropriate vacancies."
Never received a call from or was contacted by a Johnson & Johnson recruiter.
Having people reviewing resumes
"Include more details when you post a new position available as: candidates profile, responsabilities and duties "
I feel they can be more clear and timely in their response.
"Provide honest feedback following the interview. After my interview, both of my interviewers thought that I would be a good fit for the position. However, the only feedback that I received following the actual interview was information given to me from a third-party stating that the recruiter told her that one of the interviewers thought that I would not be a ""good fit"" for the position. A little honesty and some sort of contact following the interview process would go a long way. Thank you."
"Communicate more in a timely manner with greater clarity and transparency,"
"J&J could call to explain what happened. I have the profile correct, so I would like understand why I didn't receive a call."
By providing specifics so as why the person was not chosen and not generalized statements.
"- Show more interest in people and not only CVs. I am a highly motivated person with a very good work ethic. I believe I could add a lot to JnJ. However, I didn't pass the 1st recruitment barrier.

- Invite more people to interviews to get to know them be"
Reply if you are not selected 
"feedback candidates, be positive or negative. in preference, before such survey is sent."
"Allow more corporate positions to be open to any of JNJ locations, not just NJ."
Give specific reasons why an applicant was not selected. I believe it will increase better qualified applicant that would've been denied.
Your screening process is obviously out-dated.
Keep applicant informed of status.
"Answer Applications quicker, and pass on true and relevant data to the hiring manager. J&J has one of the worst recruiting group of people I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with.  I know it is the recruiting people, who are probably contractors, who don't care about J&J, the people who are applying nor the agency they work for, it is the whole company. Please hire, spend more money hiring better recruiters, or your company will get polluted like IBM has, "
Hold a phone interview with me. The resume does not always give the best reflection of a person's potential. Especially true for sales which is more about attitude than experience or how well you type your resume. 
"I am highly qualified, skilled, versatile, and educated beyond all the positions that I have applied for, but only had one interview. In the one interview that I had, they discarded me because I did not guess what they wanted me to discuss as they never asked questions related to the size of the investment portfolio that I managed. I know that there must be several candidates to choose from, but I would like to review the resumes and meet some of the candidates that were awarded the positions where I was not even granted an interview."
"give a reason that I am unsuitable
make it less impersonal"
If not selected atleast inform why 
Feedback was non-existent.
Provide further explanation about why an potential employer is not a good fit or not so good than others.
"Hello,

Thank you for the survey. I was not contacted and I did know that the process was completed and I was not a good fit for the position until I read the first question of this survey. 

Best regards,
Bahar"
"I applied for another job here however I never heard from the acquisition team on how my application went. With this particular opening, I never heard anything from them. Kindly inform applicants if they are not accepted. Thank you."
"React on time, not only via system-generated messages."
"Hi,
if somebody applies as a product manager for Johnson & Johnson, he will have definite ideas for increasing sale and research for product development. There is nothing in the recruitment process to ascertain this fact. Leave my case aside. I am already 58 and may be of not much long term use to you. But you might miss people who can create the hundreds of successful starts ups like in India (Pathanjali, Dhatri, etc). thanks "
"I think you must conduct a phone call interview , I've been waiting for someone to invite me or call me however i don't received any calls from you. rather that sending a email."
"At least to provide feedback on whether I have been accepted for the position or not. As I had my interview over a week ago with no response. Moreover I do not know whether i should take this survey as a validation that i have been refused the position or not! I would really appreciate the response and a formal feedback. 

Thank you,."
the feedback is very slow.
"The recruiter was great until she handed over the interview process to the hiring manager.  The communication with the hiring manager's administrative assistant was poor.  They confirmed my interview date two business days before the interview.  A range of tentative dates were set but confirmation occurred at the last minute.  The admin provided no help with travel arrangements or directions.  When the interview was completed there was no debrief explaining next steps; I was literally shown the door.  

After the interview I contacted the admin about miscellaneous travel expenses and I was told that JnJ does not pay these.  I had to contact the hiring manger via LinkedIn because they would no provide their business card or contact info.  Through LinkedIn I inquired about reimbursement of my travel expenses.  Three weeks later the hiring manager approved the expenses and I was paid.

I had tremendous respect for JnJ, however, this experience has really given me second thoughts on how JnJ conducts business an treats its employees."
"for this experience, the experience was very good."
Improve communications would be helpful.  I also think the company should determine a method to measure intensity of candidates.  Not sure how this can be done but I have always wanted to work for JNJ's HR function and I have tremendous qualifications.  Since I have 25 years experience I understand how candidates can get lost in the system but I expect with JNJ's resources at their disposal it should be setting the standard.  None of this will keep me from applying in the future however.
"After applying for your job application by seeing job responsibilities the reply is your are not a suitable candidate for most of jobs ,please be specific what kind of person required in job responsibilities and please also mention why the applied candidate is not suitable to the applied job.

I just want to understand how your screening the candidates."
I know that a company as large as your has a good applicant pool to choose from.  As a potential employee it would be nice to speak to a recruiter to explain why I would be a good choice for your company. 
"I applied for numerous positions which I believe I would be a great asset to your organization, but I was only contacted once by a recruiter and that was last year, and after having two great rounds of interviews, I heard the position that I applied for was eliminated.  Any new positions that I applied for I was never contacted by a recruiter.  I would love to be a part of the J&J family at some point in the future, but it doesnt seem like many opportunities are currently available.  I just hope my resume remains on the top of your pile for when an opportunity does present itself.  Thank you"
I would have preferred an interview in person instead of a video conference. 
Don't invite candidates for an interview if you already know that you can't offer a compeditive salary.
Speed up the interval between the time that an application was submitted until a response is received by the Applicant
I have never received a kind of a message relating to my application ...
"I applied for several positions, was asked to do a video interview from what seemed like an automated email. Never contacted, never received any feedback. Overall I think my talents would serve your company very well, still very interested in working for a company like J&J, however very disappointed with the lack of communication. "
provide more information to applicants about the timeline for interviews/rejection notices. provide a hiring manager contact for some form of a contact where questions can be directed 
provide more information about the hiring process and the timeline for interviews and/or rejection letters
"There are several IT issues in the portal. 
The forgot password section does not work and there is no way feedback can be given"
I believe Johnson & Johnson recruitment is very crafted and carried out by highly trained professionals. I had the opportunity to participate more than once in J&J processes and have always been very well guided and with complete information about the opportunity and about the company. I believe they have created more desire in my person to be part of J&J. 
"First, change the subject line of the email asking to take this survey.  Taking a glance at the current title ""we would like to hear from you"" makes it sound like J&J is interested in moving forward on candidacy.

Second, no status updates are given throughout the process.  If an applicant is denied from the start they should be notified as soon as they are removed from pool.  "
hire me--- I will be your best hire! email: keith07481@gmail.com
"As a shareholder of JNJ, I would have liked to receive a call from the recruiter and provide the reason why I was not a good fit.  Good luckk"
"
Inform in first contact that speaking English is required nunero 1."
They can hire a person from pharmaceutical back ground like me.
"I haven't heard back anything from J&J will wish get some info about my application..?  

Better contact even automated

Job application tracking ability for applicants."
Provide follow-up on positions applied for. I still have not received follow-up on the position this survey was sent out for. 
"As an RN with 3 decades of experience I do not feel it is my place to tell you how to best administer your Human Resources Department. I feel you are an outstanding company whose longevity and reputation speak for itself on the international stage. Whether I believe or not that I should have been interviewed for the position is irrelevant. I still respect your organization and should something develop on a part time or per diem basis you might consider me. I have accepted a new position recently as a surgical RN. Good Nurses are like anything else, in short supply. Thanks again for giving me the opportunity to apply with you. Have a great and peaceful summer.  Respectfully, Miles McNett, RN,  B.A., B.S.N."
"the recruiter should contact me and provide a reason why I am not a good fit for the position applied. Understand the structure of the demanding Department for candidates, clarify it for candidates. Explain if there is something to hold the candidate to move to next steps. I think an adequate recruiter feedback helps to build company's reputation. "
Have the recruiter contact the candidate to let them know whether they got the job or did not get the job.
"I know it may be unrealistic given your volume, but perhaps a more personalized letter detailing why one was not pursued further would be appreciated. Canned responses are very deflating."
Improve communication - timeline
Update when positions are taken longer than the usual timeline. 
I haven't received any feedback from Johnson & Johnson. It's a bit weird and inappropriate behaviour for such big and people focused company.
Appreciate it if feedback is provided.
send the interview letter and call the candidate for interview rather than waiting ...then you can decide whether he or she is eligible for your company or not.. 
I would like to have a constructive feedback to understand where I can improve my soft and hard skills.
I would like to have a constructive feedback to understand where I can improve my soft and hard skills.
Process is not clear and candidates does not have visibility of the process.
"I did not hear back from the recruiter for so long after the 1st interview even though I sent her a thankyou email right after the interview. The interview was rescheduled twice before happening, on the first time I waited for 20 mins for the call by recruiter but she/he did not call. I did not get informed about a change in schedule at all and I emailed back to someone to ask and 1 week later got a rechedule email. My interview experience was fine but I only got the result email almost 2 3 months later after that. J&J please improve on this. Thank you"
.
Improve mail contact with employee. 
Provide reasons for non selection.
"I can see a process, is more like a computer follow up, no communication no nothing...."
This was the most unprofessional interview that I have taken throughout my career. The HR contact provided no feedback. The panel that I interviewed never provided their business cards or contact information. I had no ability to send a follow up email. In all honesty this was a debockle.  I know I could have delivered premier results in this position. 
I do not know status of my application yet
I actually was not involved with a recruiter directly.  My resume was submitted online.  My son however is a J&J employee
Give better feedback about your elimination the recruitment process
Provide follow up to candidates.  I have heard nothing from J&J even though I met all the qualifications for the position.
"Good day!

Johnson & Johnson must contact the person immediately if they not qualified or fit in to the position.

Thank you for taking your time in considering my application

"
Serem mais claros nas vagas e darem retorno.
It would be very useful if a live human being were available to discuss opportunities and respond to questions
provide candidate with a feedback on his/her application; shorten response time to application
The process has taken a really long time and there was  never any message (not even a generic e-mail) to notify that you were not considered for the position. 
Provide more feedback on reason for not getting the job and reply to email asking this
Provide feedback to candidates.
Bring In the candidates.
Provide Better feedback!!

"It has been my dream for several years now to work at Johnson and Johnson. (So much of the mission and culture alignes perfectly with my own value system). I'm a MD,MPH; and everytime I earn a degree, certificate, skill, or more experience I visit J&J webpage and I am back applying to my area of expertise. I apply to the positions I'm most talented and recognized for. I get a generic email that doesn't offer a job interview.
Though I am often head hunted by recruiters for my unique experience and skill set.  I have declined similar positions to the ones I apply for at J&J at other pharmaceuticals. The only way I would leave my current job would be to join Johnson and Johnson family. 
I almost get the feeling that the generic responses are robotic and the emails are electronically generated. I also have the assumption the only way to get through this electronic screen is to have an internal reference bring by my paper resume to HR. I hope I'm incorrect, and there are skilled HR recruiters spotting unique talent by throughly going through all the resumes that come in. 

Thank you for your time,
"
I have apply for job before 6m month but response was to late 
No recommendations at this time.
"The system is not working for Turkey. I was highly qualified candidate for the role I applied, but I got rejected by the system without any feedback. Now, I got offers from other global big pharmaceutical companies. But , very dissapointed with your recruitment process."
"
- Calling the candidate for the interview after finding his CV interesting instead of providing an on-line test.
- Providing the reasons why the candidate was not successful.
- Giving opportunities to the new graduates."
"I did not receive an interview opportunity so I am not able to offer any improvement thoughts for the recruitment process.  Perhaps the application/post-application process misses the opportunity to capture excellent talent at a true value.  (It missed me, smiley)"
More careful attention should be given to individual profiles. No recruiters ever contacted me concerning the reason for not being selected even if my profile did fit the applications I was interested in. 
I think you to minimize the time interval between application and interview/ short listing.Secondly give brief instruction to  graduate candidate to proceed in particular area according to their profile and give equal opprotunity to graduate candidate also.
"I received an email saying that I was not chosen as a qualified candidate following my interview. However, I was never offered an interview. I was referred to the program by an employee and I casually spoke with the sales learning manager. He made it seem as though I had the qualities of a competitive candidate and that I should go ahead and apply for the position in the STR program June class 2017. I reached out to him about why I did not received an interview, and he said he would look into it but never got back to me. I feel as though there may have been a mistake or a misunderstanding with the application process that affected my chances of having a successful career in your company. I wanted to bring this to your attention. I wouldn't want something like this to happen to another qualified and passionate candidate, so that you do not lose the opportunity to gain valuable employees. Thank you so much for the opportunity, and thank you for your consideration on this matter.

"As a matter of fact, I did not receive a phone call and was never interview. Just a rejection email. However I still think J&J is a good company."
No contact was made. Would like the opportunity to interview for positions I am qualified to fill. I am a former McNeil/Johnson & Johnson employee.
Look at former employees for available positions
Johnson and Johnson contacted me about a position that may only last a few months.  The recruiter explained the division may be sold.  He stated if I was chosen for the position it may only last a short time.  I appreciated his honestly.  I am still very interested in a position at Johnson and Johnson and hope to see one on the website that fits my qualifications.
Someone with nine years of relative experience with Johnson & Johnson who was an executive director should have at least been interviewed for the job...
"Provide the reasons why I'm not a good fit for the position applied.  There are the belief that positions are posted just to comply with the procedures, but the hiring managers most of the time already have the candidates for the positions. "
Allow personal contact to HR from the beginning on.
I didn´t receive any feed back and also the responsivle didn´t give details about the process. Very bad experience
"So far my experience has been very positive.  When I get the notice that I am not a fit, although it would be nice to get feedback and to why, I do understand the 100's of applications that are received for a particular position.  I am right now in the running for another position, and the recruitment process has been fantastic so far."
"Allow recruiters more flexibility in reaching out to experiences talent with ""gaps"" on their resume due to the financial situation of '08 or other reasons beyond the talent's control.  

Having had an interview through Kelly Services a while back, make sure the hiring team is fully engaged and not taking phone calls during the interview.  I would never do that to them.  This hiring person never heard how much experience I had with my PowerPoint skills so when the recruiter let me know that they thought I didn't, it was only because the hiring manager was on the phone and had interrupted my discussion of having more than 20 years of PowerPoint skills.

It's disappointing to know what I could bring to J&J only to be turned down repeatedly for unknown reasons when just receiving a rejection email.  I get that everything is the world of recruitment is more automated than ever, but if I am turned down due to gaps, that needs to go away.  A recruiter has never contacted me and I can only think that my gaps were the reason since I have experience in the Pharma industry and the required years (more than) needed to at least get a call.

Thank you.

Second, "
Johnson & Johnson could be more open to older candidates.
"Le processus de sélection (comme toutes les autres grandes sociétés) est assez obscure (boîte noire, délai, mode de sélection).
Il serait souhaitable d'avoir un système moins automatique.
L'annonce semble rester 3 mois alors que le poste doit déjà être pourvu."
Contact all candidates on their status.
Contact you to let you know why you were not in the running for a position. Let you know when other similar positions are available. 
"Until now, I have not received any contact. Even a negative position of any recruiter!
 
I really would like to be contacted and I would love been working at Johnson & Johnson.

Best regards, 

Cesar Nannin Boaventura"
I recommend that Johnson & Johnson ensure that an email response is sent to all applicants on the status of their application. This will greatly help.
"
Give feedback so that the candidate can have the opportunity to remedy possible shortcomings and better expose important points that have not been stressed"
"
I DID NOT GET THE RECRUITER'S FEEDBACK, I SENT E-MAIL AND THEY DID NOT ANSWER ME, THIS IS A LOT OF DEORGANIZATION AND LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE CANDIDATE"
more feedback through the process especially when the process expands over an extended period of time.
I never received a follow-up but would have like to learn the details as to why I fell short in the process as to know where improvement can be made. The position was something I am well qualified to handle.
"I have applied to many positions and was never contacted for interviews or anything. I would suggest the Johnson's company to consider my Curriculum and, at least, call me so I can introduce myself and say why I am applying to these and what I am looking for. I am pretty sure I can highly contribute for the growing of IT Services at Johnson & Johnson company."
Quit sending stupid surveys?
Actually talking to people would be a good start
Actually talking to people would be a good start
To really evaluate whether some skills sets and attitude fits in the job although knowledge is also important. 
reason provided why i was not a good fit was not specified
improve personalization of communications
give more chance to know the candidates 
"To be really honest, I admire a lot the company, but I'm really disappointed with the participating in the Brazilian process. After some interviews, I had no answer from the HR. Even after some e-mails.
Dedicating time to the process and being ignored is not what candidates expect."
"It seems that finding job offer list was not user friendly.
I think that it would be better off if the link activated on the job opening poster."
"I would have liked to have an appraisal of the interview, which will take me forward for future interviews. It was a discrepancy between job description and expectation about skills in the second interview."
"Provide feedback. Even when prompted by email, I still didn't receive any feedback."
"Get in touch with potential employees. In addition, be a little more open to international recruitment out of USA. Best. Oscar Serrano, omserran@yahoo.com"
"I applied for a position that I am qualified for in October of 2016. I applied online and was also referred by a current employee. 

I haven't received a single email or phone call about the position in the last 7 months. Now that I've finally received an email, it's a request to take a survey to let you know how well your recruitment process works. 

In my case the recruitment process has not worked at all.  "
There should be responses from the company HR atleast for the applied positions.
I received an email asking me to apply. When I clicked on the link the next day the job posting was not there. It said the position had been taken down. So I was never able to apply. I have been trying to apply for a bit so I was really disappointed in this process. I am hoping to have another opportunity. 
"Better communication.  All I received was an email stating my application had been received, then another almost 3 months alter stating I had not been selected.
It would have been nice to receive communication from an actual person instead of just a ""bot"".
It feels like my application/resume was not even seen by a human being."
"Communicate, I did not hear from anyone at JNJ."
i would like that JJ can do a call up me 
"In my perspective, the recruitment process I've participated was fair and understandable. For this reason, I have no improvement suggestions for now."
If the recruiter would follow up with the candidate as to their place in the selection process.
Feedbacks. Just feedbacks.
"Although I understand that recruiters receive ongoing amount of applications, it is still important and professional to provide some type of response in a timely fashion.  For whatever reasons, over the course of the past 6 months plus, I have not been receiving consistent, usual or timely responses from Johnson and Johnson after applying for a list of positions.  As a former J & J employee who knows the company fairly well this has proven to be very disheartening.  "
"I just got a Mail, telling me that I do not meet the minimum requirements for this position. I took a second and third look at the requirements but could not find any qualifications that I do not meet. Therefore, it would be nice to get a second feedback about the reason for not being a good fit. Thank you in advance! "
The interviewer was racist and bully. One of them came with predefined notion to reject me. That was evident from the introduction process. He laughed at me. I will never recommend anyone to join J&J
"Hard to say, I was just participating in a position for a one role. Probably in the future I will know more :)

Contact directly the people who apply.
"Give at least one reason if not a good fit. 
Getting answers from a recruiter and not automatic emails that you can't reply to."
Should reply the candidate if they were successful for a job
"I have been applying through your website religiously since last four to five years at the least. I have applied for positions that match my current role to positions that mostly match my current role. I am a candidate who has the education, training and the experience required to fully satisfy the role of the positions I have applied for.
However, I think your website does not work, or the application sent through the website is not monitored since I have NEVER heard back on any application, let alone even offered an opportunity to interview.

I am extremely disappointed and demotivated in applying at J&J. However, I still would love to have an opportunity to work for J&J."
"They could call the potential candidates keeping them informated, they just send a template  email without clear information. 

Regards,
Ninfa"
Contact an applicant either by email or in person rather than nothing
No information provide why you are not selected... Even I fullfill the criteria..
Try to Give candidates Chances because they may be at the interview better that the C.V
Need to call the person when he has applied for the current position but there is no response from the recruitment team
"Store the CV, interact with prospective employees on their job preferences and periodically check with them for updates in the CVs if any.

More importantly, keep showcasing if something fits / matches requirements.

As I was only recently selected to apply for one job based on previous experiences with J&J I cannot say that my knowledge on the recruitment process is as complete as this survey might suggest. I am seriously interested in exploring more opportunities to be recruited by the J&J team so that maybe my feedback might be more conducive to the needs of other prospective employees and the employment process.
I was never contacted for the clinical labeling coordinator position. 
"Give an equal opportunity to all, and atleast  let the candidate know what is the reason, rather than sending an auto reply."
"1.  Stop trying to 'weed' out candidates simply based on salary expectations.  There is more to just salary - there is total compensation as well as culture and challenge.
2.  Definitely follow up with potential candidates."
The rejection letter for the position was sent only a few days after the application was submitted which shows me that the company did not give me much consideration
"I was never even contacted by anyone at Johnson & Johnson. Ever. I sent emails to find out the status of my application and received no reply at all. I don't even know why I'm getting this survey because I didn't even go through the recruitment process. I would really like to work for Johnson & Johnson, but I'm disappointed by how things went. "
"Better Communication, be subjective and more punctual on their hiring process..."
Be transparent of the status.
make the J&J career website more user friendly. 
I would like to belong J&J family. I wish to be contacted for new hiring process
To give a feedback would be nice.  Thx
"Please accept new potential applicant instead of internal referral only, so everyone get a fair opportunity. Thank you. "
Starting responding. You asked me to apply and nobody every got back to either rejection or interview - For almost 8 months!
"I thought the interview process was very lengthy.  I personally believe that phone interviews are not always the best measure of a candidate.  I wish I had the opportunity to meet the respective Managers and Recruitment staff. 

In the future I hope to have the oportunity to interview with Johnson and Johnson as it is a company I would enjoy working for.  "
Actually contact applicants- the request for this survey was my first news that I was no longer in consideration.
I was never contacted for the position. 
"O processo de recrutamento continha um teste de inglês, após completar o teste no tempo previsto notei que não recebi nenhuma confirmação eletrônica sobre a realização do teste, então prontamente contactei a responsável pela vaga, após uma semana obtive uma resposta de que meu teste não havia sido computado pelo sistema e que eu havia sido excluída do processo seletivo, fiquei um pouco frustrada, pois tentei avisar sobre problemas com o teste mas, não obtive retorno e ainda assim fui excluída do processo seletivo. Gostaria de ter recebido uma outra chance para fazer o teste e participar do processo, infelizmente não foi possível."
"Discourage people from outside US to apply for US-based posiitons, if it involves visa procurement. Kindly post such positions only for people within that location."
Kindly be more transparent 
Be more transparent
"If I were to be considered for a position at J&J, I would like to receive information about the status of the recruitment process. 

However, If I were not being called in for an interview, I would expect feedback about the reason for declining my job application. Hence, I can improve it for future vacancies at J&J
"
"Hi,

Thanks for giving me chances to evaluate J&J recruitment process.
i d like to suggest following items.

1) Transferable skills: Pls pick up candidates based on transferable skills not based on an exact match to industry.

2) Feedback: Pls give candidates feedback why they are not shortlisted

3) Internal Job description: Reviewing JD of J&J, most of the language look like internal job description

"
"I never has been contacted in every position you can posted and I applied so in relationship with my seniority and my professional background it seems to me strange maybe I think that for an important company such as  jnj it could be mandatory to give a feedback to yours ""supporter"" only for the brand imagine too.
My Best regards"
INTEGRAL PROCESS OF MANY STAGES AND REASULTADOS EXCELLENT
"Be more inclusive, less subjective and offer greater inclusion"
"The recruiter needs to be able to identify quality candidates that are able to solve their problem and provide solution to the company; not base on a quick look at resume/CV. There must be a minimal viable requirement, but there should be more interactive with the candidate or come up with a method that will be able to identify key candidates. For example, a quick survey about solving problem in a work environment or test on candidates' soft skills."
All the mothers around the world know the name of Johnson & Johnson somehow in their life cycle. The products all about Johnson & Johnson is so popular. In this circumstances for this organization sustainability employee must carry the core values of this organization. In recruitment process it  can be added about the CoC values & sustainability measures some one could be followed.What could be the KPI's?The corporate social responsibility & be in compliance what are the steps required can added preciously because these are all about the part of so precious thing of our life that products for the babies- the future of this world.
"This is crucial for a recruiting process that’s looking for candidates with technical skills, or a strong background or experience. Sadly, people like and stretch things on their resumes, creating difficulty to the process and to the company after the initial hire. Don’t be afraid to ask a copywriting candidate to write a press release, or a programming candidate to write a short code, or a sales candidate to do a mock sales call. Especially if the test is on the spot, it’ll make it clear who can work under a tight deadline and who actually stands up to what the resume says."
"Recruiters should give feedback to candidates, or even get in touch with people who applied to the job to know the reason why they weren't qualified."
I was told my presentation and experience was excellent by the Directors and then received a notification without explanation where I fell short that I was not going to be considered for the position.
"So many Employes Are Working For Johnson & JohnsonThrough The Thirdparty,Is There Any Vacancies In Direct Payrole Based on Candidate Eligibility Who is Working in Thirdparty  For Johnson And Johnson Please Adopt Them"
I never heard back
"I was never contacted directly by a recruiter. I only received automated, generic emails."
More thorough and timely communication
Communicate with the candidate to take the next step or to show appreciation either by acceptance or rejection 
To improve contact process 
Johnson & Johnson falls into the same mold as many other companies with the recruitment process - they do not care about their applicants. Absolute atrocious application process as applicants do not hear back for months regarding their status. I believe I applied in January and did not hear back until April. 
recruiters need to tell applicants as soon as possible if they are not the right applicants not wait until 3 months later before sending out a generic rejection email.
Less chemicals & more organic. maintain quality
"I got a pre recorded video interview on 28th November, whereas the whole process of recruitment was done by 14th November. I know this because the last question during the video interview was, will I be available on 14th to give in person interview if I get selected. Yeah, I have the time travel machine with me. Apologises for being unprofessional and giving a sarcastic comment, but that was terrible on the recruitment team, as if playing a joke on a candidate for the recruitment process. For me, that was demotivating, seemed like, mocking an already nervous student who wants a job by giving them an opportunity which doesn't exist. I may not be the best candidate according to your HR team, which is why I never got a callback, but that wasnt professional on your side too. Please, update your system, because clearly the email sent to candidates doesn't line up with the whole recruiting process. Thank you."
"To show some consideration to someone who considers to work at J&J. The process took months, a recruiter never called me to discuss my qualifications, skills and background (even though I strongly believe I was a perfect fit for the position) and - surprisingly one day - I received an email just saying that I was not approved in the process."
"I only had a phone interview, and although the interviewer gave me feeling that I will go to the next level interview, after 2 weeks I received an e-mail saying I am not further considered for the position I have applied for. This felt me believing that the position was already given when the recruitment process started. it seemed like a fake process, needed to document that J&J had a number of interview to fill this position, but in the end, a person (probably from the organization) known from the start got the job."
"The employee's at the Lititz facility were very helpful and friendly to me during the process. I have never experienced this kind of treatment in other companies I have pursued employment. My only complaint would be that I wish they would have given the scores on the tests given for employment. Thank you, and keep up the good job your team is doing."
Hope to get an interview opportunity as my skills and experience closely match the role applied for. I'm not sure why I'm not shortlisted. 
No recruitment process at all.
"There was no recruitment process at all. I did not receive any feedback nor invitation to attend any stage of the hiring process. I even received the survey link before even receiving a general email saying that I had not been chosen.

I think it really needs to be improved."
Since I work at JnJ at the same location as the HR is placed I would expect that HR informes me directly and not via a standard email to the private email.
"Consider the highly experienced ones who are not only able, capable and experts but also willing to join the highly reputable company. Thank you.
I can be reached thru my mobile number 09175117134.                                  

Ron Cuenca , Senior Procurement Manager"
streamline the recruitment process please
Try to not just send out (extremely) impersonal standard emails.
I was never interviewed....so it is hard to say.
"You shoul have the interview with the candidates.
"
"The recruiter should be able to adjust to the development of the interview considering the rational diversity of the candidates. The recruiter should not be limited to following a script where it restricts the candidate's sincerity and even limits him in expressing his ideas. For the second time I had the experience that my interviewer interrupted me by not allowing me to complete my ideas giving the feeling of hostility in the process which is not aligned with the values ​​of JnJ. Based on my knowledge and experience she has a minimum knowledge of the subject so if the candidate delves into ideas she can not adjust to the conversation.
In addition the recruiter must maintain impartiality at all times (in my interview I could know that they were going to recruit a man) and above all to avoid communicating their input with body language to security employees who even looked at me with regret when leaving.
Recommendation:
1. Panel interview to incorporate the vision in the specific field of the position and thus allows to add objectivity to the process.
2. Create awareness to the recruiter that the candidate is also evaluating the company profile through it."
It would be nice to have more communication
All is perfect
respond to my email and job application
"I like Johnson & Johnson as a company and that is the reason why I applied for the position by taking time to research about the company and showcasing that in my cover letter. However, I just received a single email stating a reject and do not want proceed further.

I strongly believed that I had the required expertise for the roles and responsibilities mentioned in job description and was very upset by just getting a reject mail. For the effort I have put into the application, I at least deserve a call from the recruiter or a specific reason for rejecting me."
I was never contacted or notified as to whether I was still being considered for the position or rejected.  It would be great to know whether the position was filled.  Thanks.
It could take into account for the positions those candidates who don´t live in the same city where the positions are required but are available to relocate. And also it could give a feedback explaining briefly why the candidate is not considered suitable for the position.
"I didn't meet any recruiter even if I was expecting to have at least one interview with him/her because of my professional experience. I didn't receive any feedback about lack of contact and I don't have any internal connection to employes/managers at Johnson &Johnson to know more or to be supported in order to meet a recruiter.  
I can imagine you received lots of applications but it would be really great to give opportunity for a talk about the position to Professionals like me.
I hope that my reply may be helpful for you.
Best regards

"Reduce the number of questions required when initially applying -- it was pretty laborious. A quicker response would be appreciated. The best companies I have dealt with do respond faster. 

And while my opinion is of course biased, I am surprised that there was no contact from recruiting or screening of any kind. I applied online for a role that matches my skill set and experience rather directly, and there was no contact for 6 weeks, until I received an automated email saying I was not selected. 

On the positive side, I appreciated the email. Not every company does that. "
Provide feedback to the candidates so that they can learn and grow from the experience. 
"Bad experience, no return from recruiter or an automatic reply about my application from the system, seems that it was a waste of time"
It would be nice to know the reason or some info.  That will help candidate knows what do and don't and be able to make things/process more efficient for both Johnson's and her/himself.
"Johnson & Johnson should answer faster,"
Do really what they say they do. Engage with the professionals who are looking for the possibility to work and develop our skills and talent for the growth of the company having communication which is the most important thing in the system.
"As a senior employee of J&J (24 years tenure and at Sr. Director level for 6 yrs) in the pharma sector, I was never contacted even once during the recruitment process for this position.  The lack of communication and total disrespect for individuals applying for internal positions at J&J is deplorable and my current experience is consistent with those who have applied for positions externally.  The sad part is that this behavior is totally inconsistent with the CREDO for which J&J takes such pride. 

Over the decades there has been a steady decline in the support that HR has been providing and this is another confirmation of that fact. I as well as my staff have made repeated comments on the CREDO surveys conducted that this is an area (HR, recruitment, talent development) which requires significant improvement but to no avail!

I hope that someone will finally listen to these comments and act on it.  It's these little things that make a company great and in my opinion, there's significant room for improvement."
"better follow-up, ideally phone call with live person/recruiter"
l think I could take in to account the attitudes of each postulator and that these can only be seen beyond the direct interview. 
Give more detailed reasons regarding why the candidate profile was not selected in order for the candidate to better adapt his competences/skills/approach to a future suitable opportunity 
"I was an internal candidate who (was encouraged) to apply, however since I had not been within the organisation for long enough (&lt; 2 years) I was not considered for this role. This should be clearly indicated so that these types of situations can be avoided as it can be very demoralising.  "
Contact applicants no matter if moving along in process or not.
It would be nice if you provided more feedback on why you are not the right fit for the position. I have applied for many jobs I have all the qualification for but never receive any feedback.  It would be nice to know what I am doing wrong or am missing so that I have a shot. It feels like I have been applying for nothing.
I did not hear anything for several weeks after the interview. I had been told I would hear the following week. Not satisfactory after taking the time out at such a busy time to travel to Limerick. I have attended many interviews but this was very disappointing.
"I am a Legacy J&J employee that has been trying to integrate back into the J&J family for over 2 years. There is no consistent feedback or follow up after the interview process. I have applied to 61 requisitions since 2015. I think the recruiters and sourcing specialists need to be more transparent and straight forward when it comes to recruiting. It is very frustrating to go through multiple rounds of interviews when the company knows they want to place an internal candidate in the vacant role. I have recommendations from various levels of upper management (Director, VP, etc.) with no success. I left the company on good terms for a promotional opportunity with every intention of returning. I would have never imagined it would have been this difficult to return. I hope my persistence to integrate is considered and is recognized as an example of my character and loyalty. "
Provide me a status on my application prior to sending me this survey. I'm assuming from the survey questions that I'm no longer being considered?
"encourage people to walk in to your office. It will also help you identify people who are responsible and able to take a commitment right away. I also suggest that each time a candidate apply, it will be most appropriate to always inform them if they qualify or not ahead of time."
Be in touch with candidates and explain the steps process. 
"The response to the application should be considerably more than the short email I got.  I was turned down for the job; that was all that was said and no reason was given.  Considering that my good friend who works in J & J helped me and recommended me, and that I am a PhD in Pharmacology who is an RN at the same time, the HR process only functions as a cold stone wall alienating good, reliable candidates.  There isn't even no phone number to contact to follow up the application. It seems that J & J doesn't really want to hire people. Nothing in the experience gives me a reason to apply for jobs at J & J, which is bad for this company."
Suggest  Recruiter should call 
Better feedback
A short feedback (decisive reason e.g. lack of experience or overestimated market position/value) from the recruiter providing a reason why I was not a good fit for the position would be appreciated. That is challenging in consideration of large numbers of candidates...
I never received any contact until after the new director was already hired.
"From the perspective of someone searching for a job, it would be helpful to have some sort of feedback as to why you choose not to continue the process with the applicant.  If there are legal considerations, so be it.  Also, while your and many others' Careers sections allow individuals to search for opportunities, it may be helpful if you were to use it as a job board yourselves.  That is, encourage hiring managers to search the profiles and resumes of the active seekers to see if they find any prospective fits.  It may be that the search criteria used by an outsider does not match with a published position, while an informed hiring manager might use different keywords and phrases or come across a candidate with potential, though they themselves may not be aware of that fact."
Feedback
"J&J could provide some actual feedback, instead of only sending form rejection letters."
I never received notifications on how I was reviewed for the position. 
"If Johnson & Johnson provide opportunity for the students who are from abroad and wanted to join. Again, I might be wrong but i heard from one of the employee that company do not provide opportunity for student on visa. "
I have positive experiance with screening over the telephone. This puts the cv in another daylight than what you see at first sight. I am very positive how my recent application was handled. I am looking forward to what the near futur can bring.
Lack of feedback
"At present Johnson & Johnson's, process for recruitment seems to be best, & as a candidate i would like to say, candidates should know in either case if he/she gets selected/ not get selected or move further in rounds of interview, the highlighting points behind both the cases by email or any other mode of communicaton because this helps every candidate to realise their own strengths they showed to recruiter or what they neede to showcase during opprtunity they have/had with them. this will be win-win situation for mankind for whom every healthcare or pharmaceuticals work towards."
"Dear Sir,

Thank you for this opportunity to join in the survey. I was glad that I actually received a feedback from your office that my application was denied. Although, I believe that I could have been a strong candidate, it would have been nice if a reason for the denial was included on the email. 

Below is a snippet of the email:
""We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Senior Administrative Assistant (5125170317) at Depuy Orthopaedics. Inc.""

Thank you and will continue to review job openings from your company as I believe in it's commitment and services.

improve the interaction dynamic with the applicant
improve the interaction / communication process to the applicant. 
Provide more feedback to why someone did not get an interview
"I would have liked to receive a feedback from the hiring manager and not from someone who was not present at the business case (last interview) and couldn't clearly explain the reasons why I was not a good fit for the position (the HR person did her job well, just it was a in-direct feedback). Many thanks anyway to everyone involved in the recruitment process for the time dedicated to me. Still looking forward to another opportunity to join J&J. "
better interaction / communication to the applicant
Hire me!!
"Did the recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to?
Did the recruiter invite you to join Johnson & Johnson's talent community?

If question 1 and 2 of this survey is what is expected of the recruiter, them doing it would be something they could do to improve the recruitment process.
 
It would have been very helpful for me to know why I wasnt a good fit. I want to better myself for the company and I would be interested to know what they feel I am lacking so I can target my development."

Ethically it is necessary to return to all candidates, but it is not necessary to return the candidates after this survey.

Thank you."
"Contact from an actual person from the HR department rather than a canned, bot response.

It would be kind for someone to have contacted me regarding the position. Thank you

Them maybe one page on info."
Respond to the follow-up emails after the interview and provide feedback. 
Nothing 
I didn't receive any relative feedback apart from a generic email. It was very disappointing.
"Continue update deadlines, not get lost as spam and not enough information on posts.  Timely correspondence by recruiters (head hunters) and J&J to monitor streamlining interview process.  Often in addition to desired position, one can usually check a box for continuing education.  Asked continually about education advancement ""head hunter""now, 6 months from that date, even 2 years down the road ..... WITH FOCUS ON A LARGER COMMISION OR SIGNS AGREEMENT TO THAT EFFECT, putting job after education that is DeVry, Phoenix colleges, not looking or talking about The Wharton School of University Penn. , needs better management seeking betterment of J&J. Thx."
I think it would applicants should be given details on why they were not considered for the position applied for.  I was told if it was a matter of my skills or if I was out of the salary range.  This is the 2nd position I applied for and I've gotten no specific feedback in either instance. 
At least J&J should notify the candidates if they not shortlisted.
To use Linkdin for higher profile candidate & Finish all the round of of Interview in one day it self.
Resources are not always how they appear on paper. I do like the electronic application process and the ability to check on progress of an applications and search other positions. 
Me candidato para qualquer vaga!!!!
All is satisfactory
Specify a reason why the candidate was not suitable for the position
"during the video interview, when I click 'next' for the next question, it didnt work. So I had to press again. Then it started working but skipped the next question and I couldnt give an answer for that. I think there should be a way to go back and fix the situation."
They need to follow up.
N/A
Communicate.   Also I got this survey because I went thru the recruitment process except I didn't. I don't even know if my uploaded resume was reviewed. 
"timely review of applications (took 3+ months for me), constant update on review status"
"At least an interview (phone, Skype, or face-to-face)"
"To give me a Chance to Show you what a good loyal employee Really Is. I'm still a candidate of Johnson & Johnson. I Would really like to work at  your Location in neuss. I Need a Feedback of my candidature, what was wrong?  Thanks in advance.  Frank"
Direct Communication with the talented candidates who missed opportunities. I beleive it's very important to implement such process in the recruitments stages
Let the candidate know the reason why he is not selected for round of interviews.
take test of every applicant & interview 
Make it faster and explain why you´have not be selected 
Give a chance for interview
contact directly people
I was upfront said a no without any further processing of my application. I think its very imporatnt for such a big company to atleast give an oppourtunity of screening the candidates in the first place and then decide. So basically i didnt really go through any recruitment process. 
I admire JNJ for lot of area
Improve the recruitment process - inform candidates if they have not been shortlisted with a brief feedback if possible.
More feedback.  
"mah...
"
"Inform candidate about anything result, before send request to interrogation. 
I not have any feedback. 
 "
To provide any feedback
"I am experiencing in times, the response for the application is delayed either positive or negative."
Informações.
To Give the feedback to the candidate it will really help us to improve better next time
A more personal rejection letter would be a good start
Actually have someone contact the prospective applicant
I was never contacted by a recruiter which surprised me since I have had great interaction at career fairs with your team. 
I would definitely appreciate any specific feedback on what I can improve on to be considered on future applications with your company. Unfortunately I only received a generic rejection message.
"Post job openings online only if you genuinely believe this is where you will find talent to fill your positions. As a graduate fresh out of college with a 3.8 GPA in chemical engineering and plenty of internship experience, I expected to at least have some success with the job application process. I filled out 124 online job applications and only received 1 interview offer and it was for a business position, not engineering. 

I don't know what it is you (and most other companies) are looking for in your online applications, but I strongly believe it is not effective because I don't understand how so many talented individuals go unnoticed throughout the process. If I can get accepted into Stanford's graduate program of engineering and not receive a single interview applying to engineering positions, what does that say about your process? "
Recruitment Process should faster and close 
give feedback as to why not selected
"https://translate.google.com.br/?ie=UTF-8&hl=pt&client=tw-ob#en/pt/i%20strongly%20recommend%20this%20article

i strongly recommend this article, when we talk with other candidates we can see ""who and why ""..."
At least give a courtesy email to reject the candidate instead of keeping quiet. 
"Entendo de minha parte que a equipe de recrutamento, deveria fazer um contato mais próximo com candidato para colocar os pontos positivos e negativos de seu perfil para posição, para esclarecer a decisão dos próximos passos do processo, isso gera uma transparência e confiabilidade no modelo do processo de escolha pelo profissional mais adequada seja a qual vaga for. Sendo a Johnson uma empresa tão importante e de grande referência os participantes geram ao minimo o respeito de um feedback claro sobre o processo, isso pode encorajar a participar de novas oportunidades e continuarem confiantes de que podem agregar para este negócio. Da minha parte estes pontos são de extrema relevância para evolução de escolha dos profissionais mais coerentes as vagas."
I think my profile was very compatible with the position I had applied for but I didn't have the oppurtunity because I wasn't contacted at all not even by phone. And I didn't have an interview and as I said before my profile was very appropiate for the position.
Prompt follow up.
Give quicker feedback for the job application process
"When candidates applied for a position, they are not notified of anything.  With the time that passed, then it is assumed that the candidate was not considered. 
 Please, notify the candidates, at least, when they are not considered.  If a reason of why are not considered is given, it is much better.  Not sending any notification, makes the candidate feel ignored and not important."
"Johnson & Johnson can improve the process by ensuring the recruiter follows up with the candidate, especially if there was personal interaction such as a phone screen and/or and on sight interview.  I was told to call if I need not hear within 3 - 5 business.  I left 2 voice messages and never heard from the recruiter either on the phone on email.  I understand there are many candidates that are considered, but if a recruiter commits to following up than he/she should do so.
"
Provide feedback to applicants
I would like more if the process would have been more personal
"It seems you provide automatic answer to any application that does not fit exactly the job description published, making almost impossible from people with experience in other industries to advance in the selection process inside J&J. Even that is not an obligation, I sincerely think you are avoiding to gain experience from other businesses that could enhance the company performance. "
Old fashion communication would be appreciated.  Candidates should be given the courtesy of knowing if they are being seriously considered or not.
HR should give feedback about the interview and maintain the date of appointment.
Have large recruiting events at the headquarters focusing on veterans and/or IT
Providing feed-back even if it's brief after each stage of the interview would be great and serve long way. I was interviewed over the phone b recruiter and after that never heard back. Thank you.
I think it would be good to provide feedbacks to candidates about their interviews and explanations why they are or not a good fit for JNJ. 
"Despite the email that  was sent to me, saying,    "" As someone who has recently gone through our recruitment process, we would like your feedback via a brief anonymous survey. Your insights will help us to improve the candidate experience,"" I was never contacted by a Recruiter."
"The direct recruitment process online was satisfactory.  

However, subsequent to the job application this survey refers to, I applied for a more suitable position at J&J through a third party recruiter. 

I accepted a contract role – Safety Analyst, Horsham, PA -- extended to me on April 28. Unfortunately, due to weeks of this particular third party’s mishandling of the post-interview process, e.g. delayed and erroneous communication, as well as misinformation, the role that I so eagerly anticipated became unattainable.

I am using this forum to convey the need of a newly hired candidate to be able to communicate with Johnson & Johnson if/when a third party recruiter’s actions (or lack thereof) result in the loss of such a promising opportunity.

I remain extremely interested in the role that I accepted.  

Thank you for taking the time to read this."

"As I did not participe process of recuiment, it will be unfair to say something about it

But after filling out some questions and receiving feedback to check the process, it's good enough.

"I don't know if this applies to J&J directly but it is something I think is an issue with the recruitment process. If a candidate does not meet the company's requirements, it would be great for the candidate to know that as soon as possible. In the past, I have gotten rejection emails three to five months after I submitted my application. Granted, I still prefer getting a rejection email over not hearing anything back from a company. I don't know about all of the behind the scenes work done in the recruitment process but it would be nice if companies communicated more with the people who showed interest in the company and took the time to apply. Yet again, I don't know this applies to J&J, I just wanted give feedback on my opinion of the recruitment process as a whole.  Thanks for listening!"
"You never contacted me, and you are asking for feedback. Strange. "

"I applied end of November 2016 and received final feedback by the hiring manager end of March 2017. This is far too long, even if the hiring manager has a lot of work.

After the second panel interview end of January I asked several times for feedback until I got finally negative feedback after nearly two months! 

Within the recruitment process the recruitment manager changed because she resigned until end of December 2016. The new recruitment manager seems to be dropped in somehow... 

The hiring manager invited me to join the talent community but I never received a official invitation from the recruitment manager or recruitment department. 

I still think jnj is a really good employer but the whole recruitment process organized by the hiring manager (not by the recruiting managers) was a nightmare and not professional at all. 

I hope my feedback stays confidential!

"Timely responses and roles that are posted actually moving forward to fruition. I have worked closely with a couple of directors at Janssen who have tried to recruit me in on identifying roles, and many of those roles end up being canceled. As much as I have enjoyed working with Janssen over the past couple of years as a part of a partnership model, my opinion of working for the organization has significantly diminished with the formal recruitment process. This is probably the last role I will post for, and this is even with the internal sponsors I have sending me additional roles to post for. Very disappointing experience."

"I've always thought highly of Johnson & Johnson and was hoping to get my foot in the door at some point. Unfortunately, the recruiting process for J&J is similar to standard industry practice, where there is little to no personal touch. Please do not take offense, I imagine that there are too many resumes received to reach out to every applicant personally. I just find it disappointing as there is no way to  get your foot in the door unless you know someone.

Although I was able to make it happen, more time should be provided to the candidate especially for those currently employed.

"For jobs where a primary candidate has been identified, the job description should state this."
"
There was too much stress test for a first interview. The first word manager said to me was: ""When I look at your CV, I see someone who does not know what she/he wants to do with her/his life!""

The recruiter person did not inform me about the process and people that I am going to interview with. There were 2 product managers in my first interview plus a recruiter. And all of them said things that I should not or cannot do this job. Then why did they invite me at all? They already saw my CV and my expertise areas beforehand, and then they are saying they would like to work with someone who did hardcore marketing instead of me at the end of the interview. Moreover that was a position for a 1 year experience required job and I already had almost 3 years experience and at least 1.5 year of it was ""so called hardcore marketing"". 

I am sorry to say that I wish I did not attend the interview at all. It was very discouraging for me and their attitude was very far away from being friendly. Also they come to my interview almost 30 minutes late with their starbucks coffee stuff (which proves that they were late, not because a reasonable cause) and laughing and without even apologizing for making me wait there. 

I can even say that it was the worst interview I have ever been. I am a very well educated person and I have been in lots of interviews from fmcg sector. I am sorry but it really was, even my friends were shocked I told them about this experience. I cannot work with irresponsble people with such attitude, even though I really like the products and branding of J&J very much... 

Thank you very much for asking my feedback. I really wanted to share my experience with someone who cares from J&J. 

Best,

"Good morning,
I have no idea on how J&J do the sorting on their process but I do know that my CV matched every single requirement there was for the position I applied to. This happened two times and in neither of them was I contacted. 
I assume the correct person was hired but non-the-less, it feels a bit too discouraging to acknowledge that someone wasn't considered because their CV wasn't even reviewed. 
Maybe shortening the period on which J&J are accepting candidacies or having extra people involved in the sorting process could be a solution. Without knowing the process itself it's hard to know the real problem. 
It's extremely interesting to see J&J taking this survey because it shows willingness to improve, not only through the people you take in, but also with feedback from candidates that did not succeed in their applications. 

Job well done."
J&J can explain more clearly reasons why the application is refused. 
"My CV was submitted into your system by an external recruiter. I received system emails telling me I needed to complete details in it, however the recruiter informed me that I did not need to do this or take further action.

I received no feedback as to why I wasn't suitable except that I wouldn't be interviewed, as no feedback was provided to the recruitment agency."
To give some feedback about the reasons why you have not been selected. A standard email is somewhat dissapointing when you have spent time in fullfilling the corresponding application. That would give you a better idea about the possibility to apply for similar jobs.

I understand, there are many applications online and a common auto generated response is sent to declined candidates, but I would suggest to send the true reason for rejection atleast to the internally referred candidates so we can work upon the same and apply with more confidence next time."

I have over 25 years of forecasting and six sigma work history and do not think that my resume was really looked at in detail for the many forecasting positions for which I posted for. I really do not think your HR team really looked at my qualifications or the HR review process does not understand what forecasting roles require. I was very disappointed that at least a phone screening was not set up. Thanks for this opportunity to voice my thoughts.

Thanks for giving me opportunity to do this survey. I have had interview with Laura Steen on 31st March, 2017 at 11:30 EST for Programming Manager, SAS Statistical Programming Lead. The Interview went very well and she told me during the interview that she would set up some time with the hiring manager in coming weeks.

It would be really appreciated if she would have informed me about her last day (assuming she would have some knowledge) with J&J or J&J could have informed me after she left regarding with whom to follow up further for speaking to the hiring manager. I just can not believe this kind of mismanagement can happen at the world famous company Johnson & Johnson.

Please feel free to let me know if there is any other questions or need to find out more.

Thanks again for letting me provide the feedback.

Thanks.

Your recruiting group needs to make sure they reach out to applicants to let them know that they have not been chosen for the interview process.  A general email stating your qualifications do not match requirements of the job should be the least they do; especially when the applicant was referred by someone from your upper management.

I've applied to several job positions with J&J and each time it was a very generic and not descriptive as to why my qualifications were not a good fit for the opportunity. Having no input as to how I can become a better candidate on paper so that I can earn an interview and get hired.

"A) In my case for the particuIar role I was asked to give feedback for, above, I was simply sent an email saying I wasn't successful. I received it twice, the second time was salt in the wound I have to say.

B) Several months** before that, I was contacted as part of a pre-screening call. The interviewer told me he'd recommend me to be progressed to the next stage but I never heard anything back which was extremely disappointing. It's not easy being strung along like that, waiting weeks to hear anything. It was a former colleague of mine from Janssen who told me the job had been filled.

** I believe the person initially offered the job, turned it down and so recruitment began again.

C) I would recommend J&J because I've worked there twice before. I would not recommend them based on their interview process I have to say. On a previous occasion I was told I was going to be interviewed on March 17th. I changed my plans on what is a National holiday to make myself available for the phone interview. I waited and waited but the call never took place.

The Credo lists everyone as stakeholders, including employees, community and stockholders. I as an applicant am not listed in the Credo and I see this is why you do not treat me and other candidates in a humane way with minimum respect, dignity and compassion.
Do not get me wrong that you are not the only company who do not treat applicants humanely - many other do the same way. But still, when I learned about your corporate culture with Credo at the center, I feel uncomfortable about your treatment of myself."

Give more people a chance for an interview so that you are not passing opportunity to the best candidate.
It can answer to all applications. And it can explain why an applicant is not a good fit if he/she doesn't fit to the position. 
The website is difficult to search for open positions
"I placed several appointments last half year and at any appointment I didn't fit enough -""a better fitting candidate...""- that can not be - "" and that additional with the background that I already have worked there..."" and so it is clear that this practice is not one which animates me to appoint again or to prospective such structures to everybody else around me. The process of contact and first personal contact by the HR departement to an possible candidate is to big several weeks til month is not a good timing in such a process.
So maybe you can improofe this in future in your concern.

No recruiters were involved with any applications made for jobs.  They were through the internet.  it is helpful for J & J to promptly respond when a candidate is not being considered to close out that particular job search.

I have already given him feedback via email in detail. This sort of behaviour is true of the region but not normal in Western Europe.

I have work for J&J for 8 years and trying to get back into working with J&J has been very hard. The Recruitment process should give previous employees first opportunity for employment. 
Currently recruitment process doing good. Hope to consider peoples from various culture and nationality.
A phone call to a prospective candidate notifying them of J&J's interest or lack there of would be greatly appreciated

"Despite my extensive experience in the field and impeccable credentials, I was never contacted by a J&J recruiter nor offered the opportunity to discuss the position.  I can only conclude that my application was summarily dismissed by HR due to my age.  To improve your candidate selection, especially for highly specialized positions such as this, get rid of the over reliance on software screening ""tools"" and stop engaging in age discrimination."
I didn't get an response. You could improve that.
Contact applicant via email to let them know that they have not been considered for the position they applied to.
"Several well qualified talented peers & colleagues of mine have actively approached JNJ in the UK recently. My experience was much like others where by we applied directly using the portal but also with additional personal messages on email to respective recruiters. The responses were either non existent, highly inaccurate or worse. Being rejected for a role is absolutely fine but there is a severe lack of any kind of future networking with candidates which will ultimately negatively cost JNJ in the long run. A real shame for such a good organisation."

Go through the CV thoroughly and then decide before scrapping anyone's CV.
it nothing much that J & J can do to improve. as per my opinion its perfect as the recruitment process.
"At least the recruitment process in Chile is luckly of feedback about further steps of the process.
Actually I contact them about a month after my second interview asking for the status of the process for the position as KAM.
Almost 2 month later I recieved an email notice I wasn´t sellected.
Is something to concern how such a big company as J&J falls in this matters of time schedules and feedback for appliers."
"Do hire more professional recruiters or train the existent ones to work in a way that enhance the employer brand of J&J and not deteriorate it... 

It was a pity to never hear back from the recruiter after the personal interview in the office. It was twice more a pity to never hear back a month later after a personal e-mail with a request for a feedback to the same recruiter.

"I was interviewed for the position on 17th February'2017. However, I was never told by person who organised my interview that I wasn't selected for the position. I had done summer internship and had some contacts and I guess because of that at least I got to know some one else had already started. It would be useful if the recruiter contacts the candidate at least within 3 weeks regarding their decision."
"J&J has a very candidate friendly, welcoming feel when contacting candidates who have been sought out by J&J and retained recruiters.  However, despite my best efforts, it is very challenging for qualified candidates to make initial contact with J&J.  Is there any way to improve how candidates can find / gain access to the talent pool?  Many communications are initiated via email to managers, sometimes executives, who may not have time to properly absorb and reply.  Could these emails be ""forwarded"" to your talent pool and then followed up directly with the prospective candidate?  - just a thought.  Good day."
Please provide feedback for rejection. That will help the candidates for further applications not only for J&J but also for other interesting employers. Even when you rejected my application I am still in favor of J&J. I think you are a great company.
"Should provide accurate reason for not selecting a candidate so that He/She may improve in that area of concern

It was all very electronic and mechanical.  I never spoke to anyone.
"Hi,

I believe they should improve their cv scanning process. I was perfect match for the position but no one contacted me, maybe because they even did not see my CV, which means the scanning or skimming process is not the best. I have not been interviewed, can not tell anything about recruiters and the process as a whole. 

Best of luck to J&J."
Recruitment process was not open and did not really provide a balanced approach.  The Taleo and referral system leave a lot to be desired as well as HR staff ability or dedication to resolving know issues.
I met the requirements by more than 150% and did not even receive a call!
Live feedback especially when you are 110% eligible for the job!
contact the person applying for a position at least once. 
Encourage training and upskilling on an ongoing basis
"Be more communicative throughout the recruitment process. Let the potential recruit know where they stand in relationship to the process.
I was never contacted by anybody at all, not a recruiter or anyone form the company.
I filled out the online application and that was the end of it.
Considering the size of your organization, it is very disappointing to realize you all have no real idea what your are doing regarding recruiting prospects for positions.
With this experience, I can honestly say I would never recommend anyone to a Johnson & Johnson position."

I have a friend that is a recruiter for J&J in South Florida who followed up for me and was told that the nature of the HR positions in general have changed.  Changed how?  My background fits the job description yet every time I apply, I get little or no response other than to verify that I applied.  Not impressed.  "

Instead, I receive an automatic email stating they found someone more qualified or thanks but no thanks.   However, I've been doing what I do for 20 years.  I don't understand what it takes to get on the radar for J&J.  Using your applicant tracking system leaves J&J losing out on very qualified people, I believe.  I've always wanted to work for J&J and would add a lot to the department I work for, and yet, I cannot seem to at least get an initial phone interview.  "
"Actually have the recruiter call me.  For what ever reason, people don't leave voice messages anymore.

"I am very disappointed in J&J recruiting.  I was with J&J for 19.5 years in sales, sales management, and senior sales management with Codman Neuro (Depuy Synthes)  I was impacted by a RIF in late 2013 and my position was eliminated.  As far as I can tell, I left in very good standings.  My last 3 performance ratings were 6, 7, and 7 respectively.  I was also identified as a ""ready now"" candidate for a National Sales Director position through succession planning.  my WWID is 65339--I'm sure my performance and work history is still in TalentNav. I have been trying to get back to J&J since 2014 and I can hardly even get response from recruiting.  I've even had several senior leaders (VP level) and company presidents reach out on my behalf.  I gave J&J every thing that I had for almost 20 years, I believe in and live Our Credo values, and I left as an outstanding performer--and I can't even get the time of day.  Very disappointing.  Frankly, I'm significantly over qualified for this particular position with Sterilimed, but I applied and sincerely wanted to pursue the position.  I even had a recommendation from the Director of National Accounts and Sterilmed, Randy Marker.  I didn't even receive the courtesy of a phone interview, or a response from recruiting. I will continue to apply for positions in my area, however I am concerned that J&J recruiting is missing out on top talent--perhaps because they are under resourced.  Not sure if the fact that I received a severance is flagging me in the system as not re-hirable?  It just seems really odd.  I can be reached at 816-916-3101 you would like to discuss.  Thank you.

Hiring Managers should follow up with the interviewees after to provide constructive crticism and feedback on how to improve. 
"I am highly motivated and although I have a diploma in my chosen field (4 yr paramedic program) I have been told J & J staff that without a degree, I will not even get looked at.  I have 3 yrs experience in the O.R and 17 yrs in EMS.  I am also an entrepreneur.  I don't know what more I can do to get noticed by J & J so I am working toward a degree.  I realize that you get thousands of applications and most likely use a resume scanning program but I don't believe the process has any equality if you are missing out on outliers that may be the diamond in the rough.

If there is a way to have the system somehow provide feedback, even as simple as ""you did not meet this requirement and we received 150 applications that met all our requirements,"" that would be helpful. Also, I wish I could just once get a phone interview. I'd love to work for J&J, but I just don't know how to make that happen. Rumor is that you have to know someone to get in.

I later reached out to my former supervisor, sent a long E-mail, only to get no response), but beyond having 14 years in customer service that made me very qualified for this role and having worked there before, though I am realistic that I am one of 221 that may have applied, as far as ""what can be done to improve the process"", instead of 'scanning & discarding' so quickly, take a closer look at who you're scanning and discarding and read their background and cover letter a bit closer as you're missing out on a highly skilled candidate with valuable experience."

2. Clearly explain the ""Real reason"" that why J&J did not consider to recruit this person.
3. Not sure did J&J'HR team really review the resume as mentioned in the recruiting website?
4. Show more passions to provide professional suggestions when reply the recruiting result.

As you know, it may take lots of time to complete relevant information in J&J recruiting website, and we fully understand what kind of level we are before applying the position. So J&J's professional feedback is expected and appreciated.
Today, I spent 30 minutes on doing the survey, wish J&J to read it and understand my points.

I was never contacted. No one ever told me I was not going to be considered for the position I was applying to.

"Improve the communication.

I applied for the position and did not hear anything.  Typically you are informed if you have not been selected.

I know Johnson & Johnson is a great company but the recruitment process is not  good."
"I recognize that disappointment related to being passed over for the opportunity can cloud an assessment, but I think at minimum after interviewing with 8 different people for this one position, I should have received some type of formal response explaining the hiring decision.  I was truly excited about the possibility of working for Johnson & Johnson, and now my impression of the company is significantly different based on this experience.

My suggestion (because this is the third position this year I have been through extensive interviewing without any job offer) would be to give something - at least a few sentences - of solid feedback explaining the hiring decision.  It would be great to know if I was simply overqualified, or if I didn't have the specific experience of the candidate that was hired, or if an internal candidate was a better fit, etc.  After the amount of time I spent preparing for and attending the eight interviews, ten minutes of someone's time to share the decision points would be nice."
Just take the time to review CV and additional documents before you reject the candidate without any reason.
kindly give opportunity to someone who is ready to relocate and ready to prove himself.
Be more specific in why you are not progressing to the next level in the recruitment process.  The email only states that others were more qualified or were a better fit.  Thank you.

"The recruiter was quick to respond when I reached out to her, however, I made the initial inquiry. I was disappointed to know that my previous project management experience in the phamaceutical industry was not accepted as experience for this role in consumer, and therefore was not selected for an interview. I feel that this process would be improved if there was an opportunity to provide commentary in the 'requirement' fields so that potentially great candidates are not screened out due to a check box. For example, if the requirement was '10 years consumer experience' - I have 17 years of combined pharma and consumer experience that may have been acceptable to the hiring manager if they were given the opportunity to probe my business knowledge in those areas. Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback! "

I was never interviewed and was never explained the reason for not been interviewed.

"I'd suggest conducting a phone interview would be a good first step.  I realize you can't do this for every applicant.  Since your jobs seem to be posted for a long period of time, maybe you are over looking people already in your ATS/database.  Try changing your parameters for searching and see what happens.  I'm sure the right candidate is in there someplace.  

HR is a function with transferable skills.  I know, you probably feel that pharma is very different, but it's not.  Most HR folks are adaptable.  I've adapted to multiple industries and was able to leverage my learnings.  Able to look at things from a different perspective, shake things up.  Be visionary.  

If you got a call from Facebook or Amazon, do you think your skills would transfer?  Or are you stuck in pharma for the rest of your career?  

If you don't call, you'll never know what you are missing.  

Have a great day,  Don

There is a technology called AJAX that allows you to start typing a city name in a box and it returns possible values as you type.  Most of us know how to correctly speel our own city names, or the names of the location where we want a job.

"The period of time between applying and getting the ""we have filled the position"" notice is a huge gap in time. Very ineffecient."
"Em meu modo de analisar o processo para seleção implantado pela empresa é bem funcional e pró-ativo, no meu caso não foi dado seguimento ao processo devido a vaga ter sido congelada, porém recebi todas as informações necessárias referente ao andamento do mesmo, portanto o processo funciona muito bem, aproveito para agradecer a oportunidade."
"Instead of the typical ""Dear John"" letter, let the prospect know why they werre not chosen versus ""we have other candidates more qualified."" A candidate takes his/her time to complete an application and forward documents and that should be respected as should a reason for not interviewing."
I would like to receive clear feedback on the selection process and be informed about future open positions in recpect to my scope of skills and experience.
I didn't know I was in the recruitment process.  I applied over 2 months ago and have not heard anything except for this survey. 
"After submitting my resume online, I immediately got an email regarding a video interview. The email said not to respond because it was automated. It also said it was urgent and to immediately complete the video interview. Since it was ""urgent"" I did not have much time to prepare (at this point I had no idea what questions would be asked). I completed the video interview within 24 hours of receiving the email. The experience was positive. I thought I did fairly well. Video interviewing is awkward and I have not interviewed in eight years. This being my first experience, I thought it was positive. About a week later I received another automated email stating that I was no longer being considered.

I felt the process was impersonal. I never spoke to a recruiter, I do not know if the job posting was clear or not since it was never discussed with me, I do not know why they felt I was not a good fit, etc. I felt disheartened by the experience given the time and effort I put into it and the lack of feedback. Hopefully, I will have another opportunity in the future. "
Give feedback
Tell me why I didn't get the job. 
"I never heard from a recruiter, so speaking to someone directly would've been pleasant."
Ensuring feedbacks in recruitment processes even in cases where recruitment is negative
to contact the candidate which is not fitting in time before the recruitment process is going on with other people in the same company
Tell me why I didn't get the job. 
It would be good to know why you didn't meet the requirement for an initial screening.  I have the skillset to do this job as well as the one for the Human Performance Institute which was posted last year.  It seems like J&J doesn't go beyond pharma experience to pull talented people.
"I'd like to have more datails about the recrutment process. In particular a feedback about the reason why i don't fit the position i was candidated for.
I'm really interested about your company and i would like to have some suggestions about the way to start a career in you company. I would appreciate the opportunity to introduce myself during an interview "
"I know it's a lot of work, but It would be great if you can provide a brief explanation that why I was not a good fit for the position that I applied to. "
"Job seekers take the time out to actively pursue and apply to positions.  The least the recruiters and managers can do is to give them adequate feedback if they are not a fit and when they commit to an interview, be on time and not rude about their attendance."
The recruter should contact is in a specific SLA or Applogies through mail 
The recruiting process seems to have some flaws.  Particularly when it comes to internal candidates.
"I am filling this out without having received a ""not selected"" letter
I had one interview with the recruiter and one with the hiring manager
I had one interview that was cancelled and not rescheduled."
I apply to J&J frequently.  I have a referral from someone that works in the New Brunswick office.  I can never get in for an interview.  I have a lot of experience and feel I would be a good fit there.
"As we move toward advancing the art of applying machines to automate tasks, we must make every effort to apply technology in ways that consider people and the processes they need to follow. So I would focus on improving your careers website interface to clearly guide people through processes. As a System Analyst, I am a strong advocate for demonstrating thoughtfulness for the people I serve. Too often, I see interfaces like the taleo.net application that J&J HR subscribes to that could be improved by putting more thoughtfulness into process design and how it is executed by people. Often this takes the form of low quality user interfaces. We should strive to do things the best way, which is to say quality should come first, particularly in user-interface design because that is the part of the process that affects the lives of people. I could offer up many examples of this as well as solutions, but I'll provide you with just one today. When you go to Update Your Profile, it displays a “Privacy Agreement” to accept, as well as some links. At this point when you click the “Sign In” link, nothing happens because the machine requires that you click the “I Accept” button at this point. This common interface defect is what I like to call “the lie”. It is sloppy in practice, and aggravating to people. The solution of course is to identify the process people should follow, then design the interface to accommodate that. In this case, of course that means that the Sign In link should not be displayed until it’s time has come, so to speak. We must make every effort to focus intensely on Quality before Cost and Delivery. This is especially true where people and machines intersect at the point of the user interface. Otherwise we are destined for “Terminator Judgement Day”. That may sound extreme, but symbolically, it actually isn’t. Now let me just say it one more time as a double-entendre for all to pondre … “Think People”! 

Gratefully,

"Faster response, not 3 to 4 months later."
"1. tell something more about next expected selection process steps
2. provide feedback"
The recruiting process seems to have some flaws.  Particularly when it comes to internal candidates.
Contact applicants with the status of their application.
I cant remember when I applied but I am pretty sure I didnt hear from anyone.
"Atleast,tell candidates they are not slected for those jobs which are applied by them by emails.otherwise all are perfect....my best wishes to j&j co...😊"
"I understand that J&J gets thousands of resumes and applicants. The email I received after applying for this position was appropriate but the questions about joining J&Js talent community was only answered in the reply email I received by stating that I could visit the career site on your website anytime to search for other opportunities.

Thank you for sending this survey, it enhances my view of J&J as a potential employer.

"Contacting me to say I didn't get the position was nice - but emailing me in advance, scheduling a time to speak, rescheduling, and then asking me first how I thought the interview process went was rude.  When a recruiter emails you and sets up a block of time to speak a reasonable person assumes it is for a job offer."
RESPOND!!! 
"Send a notification that positions were filled or that application was unsuccessful. It is understandable that the high volume of applications would result in a stressful undertaking with a commitment to replying to all individuals, but bulk notifications are a common and relatively easy process for notification purposes, and is a process an amateur could undertake. It gave me an impression of an unorganised and/or a somewhat disrespectful process and a view that the process lacks pretty much any form of quality control, which highly surprised me in that all I had researched and had heard about J&J, was that it was a quality organisation. My view has changed. My view has been highly influenced by the recruitment process, it seems that no overview or consideration was given to the recruitment process at all if it was subcontracted to an agency."
If you're going to ask if a recruiter has made contact you should have recruiters who call prospects.
No suggestions are available as I do not know everything about Johnson & Johnson recruitment strategy and Johnson & Johnson vision.
"Please read the comments submitted for R&D, Polymer Processing (8911170203) position. The interview with a hiring group is not a good idea. If they feel that the candidate is a hard worker, then some members in the group do micro-politics to avoid hiring. It happened to me with J&J. Those technically incompetent people always try to hire incompetent people so that they can relax. But J&J is going to lose millions in revenue."
"Thanks for asking for the feedback. 

Three feedbacks:

1. In today's world, resumes are not true representation of talent. Adding a technical questionnaire to the application process that would help you filter the good candidates and reduces or eliminate any doubts/prejudice/biases. Its unfortunate that I didn't get a call from J&J team to demonstrate what I have to offer, but having a better process would help hiring manager to understand all the applicants.

2.  Also visa sponsorship question that is currently in almost all employers is ambiguous and every recruiter and also applicants have different understanding of sponsorship. In, SAP HCM expert and I work different HRs and recruiters, everyone has a different understanding of that question.  Changing the verbiage would help.

3. Overall, applicant registration process was smooth.

"Rejection e-mails are auto-sent only months, sometimes a year, after the position is posted. No company is worth waiting a year for. J&J's recruitment process being so mired in bureaucracy is surely an indicator of how monolithic its corporate culture must be. I'm willing to take my talent elsewhere."
"At least interaction is to be required, so as to come to any of conclusions."
Provide an email back in a timely fashion in regards to position applied for and the reason you are not moving forward in the hiring process. 
More information regarding why an application for employment was not considered.
Contact people who apply for jobs and let them know if they are being considered or not.
"As an employee of J&J, I must admit that this process was eye opening and completely embarrassing and disheartening. It was not a Credo based process at all. I tried contacting the recruiter to introduce myself, talk about how I was a fit for the position, no response. I reached out for updates, got no response. I never once heard from the recruiter. Approximately two months after applying, my manager informed me that the manager of the hiring manager wanted to go a different direction. I had clicked the box that ""my manager is not aware"" because I was worried about the negative effect on my relationship with my manager so I guess I will find out at my mid-year review how that impacts me. I never got any additional feedback about why I was not a good fit. I honestly have never been more disappointed in J&J. I just don't understand, if we as an organization are willing to treat each other this way, how do we treat external candidates? We are constantly having the Credo preached to us, it would be very beneficial that the recruiting process align with those values as well. In the new OneMD HR culture, they talk about career progression and development, what kind of development are we being provided when a hiring manager can hide behind ""going in a different direction"" and never talk to the candidate in an interview situation. I strongly believe the business needs to look at itself in the mirror, and make sure that the leadership team is aligned to the messaging that being emphasized to the employees. "
"Stop favoritism, nepotism and selection of candidates on the basis of ethnic/religious background, for which I remain a victim in the selection process of three different positions I applied for, at the pace of 2 years time. I explained in detail about those 3 position in my previous survey. I have 2 Masters degrees, and 9 years of experience in pharmaceutical and related Labs here in Ontario. I applied to positions ranging from Lab tech positions to Document reviewer but was neglected every time for each one. This is very discouraging and disappointing for me. Just to let you know, for the Position of Microbiology Technician (3000170223), I was never called/invited for any interview and received the survey for 2 times for it and I submitted my feedback. Thanks."
I would very much like my resume and information made available to all recruiters within the company and to be contacted if a recruiter sees me as a match for an open job in my region and based on my preferences.  
More contact to let you know where you stand.
"at least send a email if the person didnt qualify for the next step on the process.
"
I did not hear anything besides standardized emails.
Communications and lack of timeliness. I've received generic rejects (which is appropriate) but for position I've applied approximately a year prior.
Perhaps a bit faster and a bit more clearer on to why someone did not get into the hiring process.
It would be helpful to know the reasons for not being considered for a position
"HR recruiter is fair and professional. She gave me a chance to talk to the hiring manager. I did the technical interview well. Then hiring manager wanted to talk to the group. The group had a lady from my University; University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Both of us graduated at the same time, in 2006; she with a BS, and I graduated with a PhD. I knew her to a certain extent  since both worked in the Department of Chemical Engineering. Because of this she felt that I would be a challenge for her in the group at technical level. So, during the interview she acted rudely. Her questions were not up to the standard and technically incompetent. I felt that she influenced not to hire me. J&J is a good company. But people like this do micro-politics and avoid hiring talented people to their respective groups. At the end, the strength of a company is its talented people. Not hiring talented people cost J&J millions in revenue and will also damage the good refutation. So I lost the trust with J&J hiring process and will not apply again. Thank you."
Recruitment process of J&J is satisfactory.
"I realize that there are numerous candidates that you must process through and unfortunately don't have the time to visit with each one of them.  However, it would be welcomed to have someone from the talent acquisition team talk with those candidates that have business experience that might fit into other areas of the organization.  The systems currently in place in most organizations don't allow for that human interaction and to provide one on one feedback.  Thanks for the opportunity and hopefully we will have an opportunity in the future."
I contracted there in the past and know that it's an ok company. But the recruitment process left a very  negative taste in my mouth for Johnson and Johnson. Very little respect for a prospective employee!!
Provide more feedback 
The recruiter should contact candidates and give them information if they are or they are not a good fit for the position they applied.
"I did not receive an invitation for interview, just an automatic email to let me know I was not selected to continue with the recruiting process. As former J&J employee I know a lot about the company and how good it is. "
After a site interview it would have been nice to hear back. Bayer gave me the dignity to call back and express non-interest. I'm now at Regeneron.
"Provide a feedback when the candidate do not fullfill the required requirement to ocupy the required job.
"
The responses back for applications are severely lacking. It should not take months to reject an application. I have also gotten referrals from friends for positions. Those you never hear back from. It is a lack of respect for people which is against your own credo. I have stopped applying for jobs at JnJ. Not worth the effort. 
"After talking to a recruiter on the phone I expect some response back - no interested, good luck, get lost, anything. I have never heard back from J&J HR. Go to hell!! There are a lot of much better companies out there. If this is how you treat a perspective employee I can only imagine how horrible you treat actual employees!"
"Dear,

I applied several times this year but never received a feedback from HR.

I took once the initiative to call HR in order to understand the root cause.  They could not explain me but did agree that sometimes it goes wrong.

I like to work for J&J and I believe with the experience, references and diploma's I have, i do contribute and we both will make success .  Unfortunately the internal HR processes makes it not possible so far for us.

Yours Sincerely,
Robin DAELMAN

I did not even get contacted by a recruiter.  
They could contact the person directly and let him/her know what's going on
Offer on the job training opportunities for those whom my be under qualified for the desired position(s) but are willing to learn and grow with the company 
"I was never contacted for this position to interview, so most of these answers are not applicable."
Give feedback one way or the other.  Especially if it is negative; people need to know what they are lacking to become part of J&J.

"please ask references and speak with them. I prepared a strong interview with a PPT interview. I was recommanded by Janssen people, I worked 5 years at Janssen and got rewarded many times. At the end, one of the example I provided to the recruiters had them think that I was not a good collaborator a d that my attitude would have been deleterious with the reps. So disapointing...I was asked for a situation where relationship is not easy and honestly, I don' t have many examples, and I think I've been misjudged. Real collaborators could have testified my true attitude and provide good feedback (medical or specialty reps, managers, business unit directors, regulatory or legal Partners...). Please consider talking with candidates' ex colleagues to get a just picture. I could have considered providing a fictive story about a relationship that was not optimal but turned out as best buddies in the world. I chose honesty and my work was crowned with success, at the end of the issue I refered to in my example. It left a bad taste of the whole process. It won't alter my perception of the years I spent at Janssen, but I've been rejected twice since then by your interview process. Once as a specialty rep in gastro (2016): was told I was ""too passionate about medical education and that I would quit the company if I would receive an offer elsewhere"", then ""not a so good collaborator for a MEM role, it seems, based on a situation I was asked about (2017).  5 years at Janssen (2001-2007) then 2 of these interviews... Thanks for the opportunity to write about this. MJBarras "

Thanks,

Ingrid Plummer "
Please make sure you come back to all applicants with a feedback 
More transparency and interest in candidates
Make sure the follow-up process happens so the applicant understands what the process and the end result.
"The system should at least provide feedback on submissions - never got notification of many bids or communications around those submittals and I feel that's not Credo oriented and tells much about a company. Worked for J&J for years expectations on how company communicates are high and should be.

This is a stupid survey where no one and I repeat no one called or emailed me about an interview ect. This is a joke really?

"Best regards, I would love to have the opportunity to work in this beautiful company since I had a friend who worked with you and I have the best references. Thank you"
"Timely feedback and some details for the reason one is ""not a good fit"" would be appreciated.  As a contractor that has had the opportunity of working for several J&J companies, both pharmaceutical and medical device, it is difficult to understand how one can be seen as a valuable and effective contractor in the services provided, but not a good fit as a permanent employee. Thank you!"
Contact candidates
"Hello!  Thank  you for requesting feedback.  However, I do not think you have accurate records since I was not invited for an interview for the Manager, Global Regulatory Affairs - Baby (9394161028).  I contacted Ms. Bruno numerous times via e-mail expressing my interest and introducing additional information about my qualifications and no response.  On April 11, I received the automated message notifying me that ""We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Manager, Global Regulatory Affairs - Baby (9394161028) at J & J Consumer Inc."".  This communication was the first one after applying for the position online on November 6, 2016.

Do a better value to the candidates applies. I have applied for many opportunities but I just had only one return. There are many opportunities that really fits to my skill. 
"I believe it`s a great company, and that`s why I want to be part of the team. So far, the recruitment process is going fine, and do not see any need for improvement so far.
Thank."
Providing feedback as to why you were not considered would help candidates understand.
"The recruitment process was very good, the recruiter was excellent. "
"I know that a such company like J&J falls down thousands of CV´s, however I´m thinking that they could think a way to at least provide a feedback honestly or either a answer for the application fairly. 

Anyway, appreciate this quiz."
"I have taken three surveys and have basically said the same thing.  I have applied and have only received an email thanking me, but I was not being considered."
A rejection of my application was received within minutes of applying which meant that J&J could have never read my cv. 
"to give the more opportunities to the person who applies for a job for discussing it, reducing the emails of rejection."
"In my particular situation my first point of contact with someone from J&J was with Skylar Thompson.  I felt she did not have the information needed to explain the position in detail, which was disappointing.  After our phone call she told me I was to attend the in person interviews in New Brunswick, only to find out by e-mail the hiring team chose not to pursue my candidacy.  I called and e-mailed her to find out if this e-mail was a mistake after she told me I was to attend the in person interviews, but I never received any correspondence from her.  Only after a few days did the recruiter from Kforce, Kyung Blackburn, contact me with a vague reason why.  Apparently, Skylar felt that because I did not know the company Credo that I did not do my research thoroughly on the company and that is why I wasn't chosen to move on with the next round of interviews.  All in all a completely disappointing experience on my end, never would I suspect a company like J&J would have that type of recruiting experience. "
Be more responsive and timely with responses.   The last notice I received with respect to a job at J&J came 6 months after I applied.
"Hopefully J&J will take responsibility and select recruiters and external supports for upcoming activities with an extreme sensitivity and more elevated and exagerated interest than in the past, to avaid extraordinary efforts on either sides and to fullfil the J&J credo: ""All companies ... are focusing on rules, which General Robert Wood Johnson has already written more than 60 years ago. The management should be guided and operated by the parent company Johnson and Johnson (Corporate) to comply with superbe social responsibility and non-profit-making as the basic principles of corporation by the decentralized organization.""

"I feel that the job application process is too mechanical and my experience shows that there is almost no human interaction. The system is all to quick to dismiss you as a candidate if all of the boxes are not checked YES.

I have applied for several different positions and have never been callex in for an interview.  I just received emails stating that I have never been considered.
No information was provided as to why I was not a good fit for the position (Manager or Senior Manager BRQC).

Keeping constant contact with the candidate on the step by step process of recruitment.
Feedback to candidates
I believe the internal filters at the initial level probably screen out a large number of very qualified candidates.
"I was not a part of a ""recruitment"" process. I simply looked on the company's website, found the job posting and applied. That was the only contact I had.

Thank you-"
I have not been contacted at all

"Dear J & J,

I applied for this position back on Nov-2016 and did not get a call or a message until 3 months later that I was notified as not been selected for the position.  There was never an interview or a phone call, only the email informing of not been selected.

Thank you."
I cannot see whether I applied to the job previously. There is no way to check what jobs I've applied to in a history list. This is not evident in the new website and career website. Please add or fix.
"Como en el caso de la postulación anterior, tener claridad en que proceso se encuetra la candidatura y criterios de la selección. en este nunca lo supe por que no me contactaron."
I believe that the recruiter should give feedback to all candidates.
"The question should be what can't you do? You took forever to just deny me even the chance to be interviewed for a job that I was very qualified to do. In fact, I know I would be excellent. I don't apply to a job unless I know I match what the employer is looking for. My level of experience in the area I applied is unmatched in the industry. You never even gave me the time of day. Great survey."
"I applied for a Medical Science Liaison position using an internal referral code. My background is in HIV immunology (PhD) and clinical research in infectious disease diagnostics (MSci). Having talked with several individuals on the Infectious Diseases field medical team, it appears as if my credentials and background would be well-suited to this role, but I never received a call back. The communication I received from J&J Talent Acquisition seemed to be an auto-generated email that arrived only a few days after submission of my materials to the online system. I did not get the impression that my application or materials had been thoughtfully considered.

I see that this position is still open online, and the contacts I made within the team indicate that the position remains open from their perspective as well. I am still very interested in competing for this position, so if there's any way to re-open my application, I would like to avail myself of that opportunity.

Many thanks.

"Might timely contact applicants who are not being considered to inform them of their status.  Also, might want to ensure an applicant has actually been contacted by a recruiter before sending out a survey to assess the interview process."
The recruiter/hiring manager I dealt with explained that I would be scheduled for the next interview and then after repeatedly reaching out to him never heard back. Then the only piece of information I got was that they went with someone else. I just found it unprofessional to tell someone you are going to be scheduled for something and moving forward and then emails or calls are dodged and no feedback is given. I think if anything I should of got some feedback and that is all I wanted if I really was not a good fit. Also just be upfront with people that they are not going to be moving forward do not lead them on.

I am rarely contacted for positions that I apply for.  This particular position I was only provided a phone screen and then told they moved on with candidates with more relevant experience.  I wasn't told what the relevant experience was that made them choose a different candidate.

"Hi, thanks for the participation. I want to tell you an experience that has to do with how the multinationals decide. In Argentina, I represent a pharmaceutical laboratory in San Luis (Ion Laboratory, ex Interbelle Cosmetics, group ELEA) that manufactured many years Listerine. We can make Listerine again with the same quality of so many years already proven and at less cost than bringing it from Brazil, which would increase its sales and / or profitability for J & J. Every time with a multinational they want to propose an idea, it buries it with bureaucracy and it is not advanced. After many years in the industry (I graduated as an engineer in Roemmers, I met the business of ELEA and also managed the business third) I discovered that behind the regulations and the consequent bureaucracy there were comfortable employees, who did not take risks for the company. Is a drawback that I see in human resources systems, which form companies with very rigid people who model the business so as not to contradict the parent company. I will test you. Now they know that the company that made many years listerine wants to analyze with you to be able to manufacture it again in that plant of San Luis (now independent of the group ELEA). Do you think you could get someone from J & J to contact us? Try it, it's a good business option. Best Regards, Rafael"

The recruitment process needs to communicate with the applicant from the beginning until the end of the process. Its like a Black hole.
"I think it is really difficult to start a recruitment process with Johnson & Johnson. I have applied several times in the past without success. The first time I establish any kind of communication is during this questionaire. I am a very well prepared and professional candidate who hope to be considered in the future to be part of your organization. I will continue applying until a real opportunity comes inside Johnson & Johnson. 
Thank you for your time to reading my comments.
Have a nice day,
Harry"
Have a team of human talent much more productive and efficient
"I think it would be interesting to seal candidates without experience in the area, because they have to contribute, since it comes without labels from other competitors."
It's Good 
Need to give personal feedback
"NO contact  was ever made with nobody.  Nobody called me.  I have submitted several applications, and only an email was provided stating I was not considered.
NO ONE EVER CALLED TO EVEN TALK TO ME."
Acredito que fornecer mais dados sobre o que no perfil não estava em acordo com a vaga.
How likely are you to recommend Johnson & Johnson as a prospective employer to family and friends
"A Johnson & Johnson recruiter has only called me once in the past 10 years, I do not recommend that my friends ""wait"" to hear from you. I think getting a call from Johnson & Johnson is like being struck by lightening - it never strikes twice."
"Hi Johnson & Johnson,
I was very optimistic about Johnson & Johnson, as it is world well known and esteemed organization which has long history. It would be a nice if recruiters has reached or email for future opportunities if I am not fit to current opportunity.

Provide reasons and also see if theres any other possible positions we do qualify for?
"Even though the world is in transition on many different levels, and Global economic growth is at its highest uncertainty in recent years,  recruiters and corporations in general might want to reflect on how they conducted their recruitment process in the eighties and nineties,  when candidates simply sent in a resume and if that resume contained certain words, coupled with experience, along with aptitude; in other words plausible,  then further consideration should be given those candidates in a prompt manner without excessive delay.  Prompt manner,  being within 2-3 business days. Hopefully this opinion warrants application.  Thank you for your consideration.  Best regards. "
Provide a reason for why a candidate is not selected. 
"Tell me why I was not a good candidate. What could I improve on, instead of just saying you are not the right fit. "
Recruit process taking long time & if candidate not applied to correct post or not suitable suggest to update them with correct facts.
Keep the records of candidate and as suitable vacancy arise then need to mail concerned candidate for interview .
Faster to deliver the decision. I was waiting for more than 4 months to get my rejection result
I never spoke to anyone. I was only contacted by email. 
Not to play in democracy during recruitment
"Never contacted, no interviews, nothing ..."
short time to know about aplication process
They need to revise their scoring techniques for selecting interview candidates.
"Good afternoon, 

Instead of looking only for the graduation notes, you should look for the experience and the classification of the internship,  because there's where you see how fitabl is the recruited.

"Yes, a lot! I was very disappointed of your recruitment process. I highly esteem J&J and all of its high quality products, use them every day of my life. Got the opportunity to attend a Career event for IRDP at IE Business School and was extremely excited of the possibility of being selected. However, I applied back in October, heard back soon and had a one brief phone competency based interview (my interviewer called late and was running short of time for the call). She mentioned I would hear back from them soon and also mentioned the process had to be finalized between december and january.

I thought that went well and heard back at the end of december, when I was asked to perform the Hogan Assessment online. Then I never heard back again, until April 22nd, when I received a standard e-mail saying I hadn't been selected.

I was super disappointed of never hearing back from a human, of the very long time waits and of never actually having a real interview!!! I believe I am a great fit, it is my dream to work for J&J, I have an amazing backlog of projects in mind but J&J hasn't given me the opportunity to discuss them.

Extremely disappointed of this very disorganized process :("
"If this was not an external posting to meet some corporate or legal requirement I do not understand why I did not receive a phone screen.  While I understand the process is to eliminate candidates and only present the stronger candidates to the hiring manager, I find it hard to believe that all the candidates held 20 plus years in the ERP space."
Ensure the process is consistent with all applicants
Always provide feedback to JnJ employee on why the person was not a good fit for the position
"O processo é demorado , acho que o CV não é bem revisado ."
J & J could answer also with the automatically e-mail when it is not interested at the candidate.
Please stop saying you've interviewed me for the job(s) I applied for ... 
I believe a simple improvement to the recruitment process would be to advise a potential employee the status of their application.
provide feedback
"I have applied to several positions within Johnson & Johnson, I believe there is too much lag time/ follow-up between the time that I've posted; to the time in which I received the ""generic"" email of ""Thanks/No Thanks"".  If you are interested in the candidate ; should communicate the status; should not receive an email month(s) later.
J&J is still one of my target companies; that I am interested in employment; I am disappointed in the recruitment process; and hopeful that the company will get it right soon."
Read the CV!  Using questionnaires solely to judge candidates are really robotic as well as if not organized properly will misguide.  For example a person with a PhD and 10 years industry experience is less than a person with a MS and 25 years experience.  This example is one of the many reasons why lead discovery in pharmaceutical companies have not measured up to their actual capabilities. 
"Does anyone even read these comments or are they just ignored? Really, Talent Acquisition? You never even bothered to contact me ... just a ""dear sir or madam"" letter ... shame on you. Who are you telling that you have interviewed me? I am a former employee ... and you guys are shameless."
You have to answer quickly
"My biggest frustration with the recruitment process is the exclusion of new talent.  Please allow me to explain.  I came out of law enforcement where I had successful career obtaining the rank of Detective Lieutenant/ Division Commander.  In researching the next phase of my career several people in the pharma industry suggested to me that my investigative back ground would make me a good fit for compliance work.  Thus, I enrolled and completed the Seton Hall Healthcare Compliance Certification Program.  My wife is a Senior Director in the industry, primarily specializing in Oncology drugs; both early phase work as well as phase 3B and 4.  Over the many years we have been together I have learned a great deal of industry knowledge from her.  Between my education at Seton Hall and what I've learned from her, I feel I can step into many compliance/regulatory jobs and quickly come up to speed and become an effective member of the team.  However, every job I put in for requires X number of years of industry experience which I don't have.  I hear my wife's frustration with some of her subordinates or members of other teams whose performance is marginal at best, but they have the industry experience. I think it would be a big improvement to the recruitment process if you expanded your focus beyond who has industry experience.  Identify potential employees who have demonstrated their ability perform and have a solid work ethic, who have a proven track record and are driven to succeed.  Look outside the industry experience envelope, you will be surprised at what you will find."
I didnt received an phone call for the process or feedback for the job position
"I was never contacted by a recruiter. I am not sure if anyone even checks these questions out - but if someone is telling someone else that applicants are being screened, that's not the case. Shame, J&J. So not ""CREDO."""
"First of all I never got a call from J&J. I dont know why I am asked to go for this survey. I had applied for this role but I was never contacted through phone or even email. I am unsure that I should be really part of this survey.

Thanks,
Aamir"
I was sent this survey even though I never received a call.  I have applied for a few roles at J & J without ever receiving a call.  This is the most communication I have had with you.  I strongly suggest you get your systems coordinated because I really don't think my feedback is what you are looking for.
Feedback about the recruitment process would be very welcome. I graduate in December and would very much like to apply for vacancies in J&J again. Any feedback regarding my last application would allow me to make a better effort next time.
"Never contacted by a recruiter. Don't know if anyone even reviews these responses or checks on a recruiter - but someone is telling someone else that people are being interviewed and it's just not true! Certainly not ""CREDO-LIKE"", J&J. Shame."
Use indeed's auto apply feature
"For this position, my updates came directly from the manager of the department, not recruiting.  I was satisfied with this level of update and contact method."
"The current computer screening process eliminates very viable people from the list of candidates a hiring manager has to choose from.  I think the process is so uniform so that recruiters aren't required to consider other potentially qualified individuals.  The focus in hiring should be more on the aptitude, past performance, the character of a candidate and their education.  Are we kidding ourselves to believe the best candidate is the one with the MBA versus the one who has stellar proven performance.  The screening is certainly the safe way to hire people, but it will certainly not move talent in and up. J&J thinks it is being fair but it is actually discriminating by discounting people who have suitable merit and talent, but do not fit a set of criteria.  Good people are sitting still while hiring managers are not presented with talent.  I oftened wonder how in a company of this size, we were provided so few candidates for a role.  It has become clear to me that the process is creating this.  "
Never contacted by a recruiter. Does anyone even screen these questions before sending them out?
To geve more feedback about the process.
So far I have not been contacted to continue with the selection process so I have no arguments to answer the question objectively
"personal contact by the recruiter would be highly appreciated, also to explain the reasons for a good or not a good fit, we are not anonymous robots"
Have a phone interview instead of basing employment solely off 3 internet questions.
I have applied for several positions at J&J and so far I have not heard back at all. even whhen the role requirement is a perfect fit for my skillset. I would like to hear back from J&J.
"I think, J&J should invite candidates for position, maybe canditates can impress them, or they can explain reasons more clearly."
COMMUNIQUER avec le postulant. Donner des nouvelles concernant le recrutement. positivement ou négativement. Question de respect.
"I found that I had not been selected, when the announcement from the departement came about the person that was selected.  Recruiting sent me an email regarding this 3 days later.  This disconnect in the update process was very disappointing to me."
"Specific feedback. I would love to hear from you! Regarding the fit for this job, as well as other potential fits.

"With some of my previous work experience I could actually provide some detailed information, but I'm not going to spend my free time doing so for nothing."
"The process between my application and invitation for the interview was very quick, Also, the face-to-face interview itself I found as very positive and pleasant experience. During the interview, hiring manager informed me that she would like to invite me for the second round of interview ASAP and I will be contacted by the recruitment team shortly to arrange the date. However, I haven't been contacted by anyone and just after almost 3 months from the interview received an automatically generated message from the system that my application was not successful - without any personalized feedback, which I find quite unprofessional given the circumstances.  "
"Notify the candidate once they have decided not to proceed with their application. This feedback is specific to Senior Finance Manager Consumer - Worldwide Business Development (Req ID 0808161114). After the in-person interview with the hiring manager and the team noone reached back. The HR recruiter did not respond to my follow up email, while the hiring manager's admin sent a note that they would be in touch. No word after that. 
This sort of treatment speaks certainly does not reflect well on the organization. A confirmation that all that glossy stuff on their website, credo statement etc. does not translate into the actual workplace. "
"Johnson & Johnson could send a position status notification, even if it's just a 'thanks, but no thanks' email.  And if you really want to step it up, consider including something personal, e.g. While we were impressed by X, or you seem like a possible fit in another area, may we consider your application for other positions."
I received no response.
I do not remember getting an email about the decision for the position for which I have applied. I just have got this mail to take the survey from which I am inferring that I have not been selected. It would be nice to let the candidates know about the decision before the survey links are sent
By giving feed-backs about the recruitment process.
I received no response.
Provide some feedback on reasons why an applicant does not meet job descrition and requirements.
"I received many, many emails requesting feedback on the process.  No updates on the status of my application were ever provided. But then again another email asking for feedback.  I gave you a ""5"" on the score because you are no better and no worse than most.

Good luck with your recruiting."
Having someone contacting me directly (at least via e-mail) clearly defining the recruitment steps and giving a position why I was not selected to the position.
"Actually identify and interview the BEST QUALIFIED, LIKE MYSELF! "
"Be human.

Don't rely on ATS alone.

"
The communication is the major gap in the recruitment process. 
Hire me
Johnson and Johnson should notify applicants if they're not a good fit for the job. A lot of time gets spent completing the online application and then it hits a brick wall.
"3 months passed between the moment I applied to the position and the automatic email from J&J HR stating the I was not a good fit for the position (no specific reason given).
In between, I had time to apply to another position, quit my previous position and start in the new company...

post salary range for the jobs.....
"Nobody contacted me although i am the right candidate for some of the position and also your HR website has issue, i end up changing my password almost every month."
Get the survey sent to the right person - not sure why I am filling this in - no one contacted me at all and I never had an interview - Your process sucks!
"I have been a contractor / business analyst and project manager for the better part of 20 years.  I have worked for Pfizer, BMS, Celgene and numerous other pharma companies.

In these 20 years, I have applied for numerous positions at Johnson and Johnson and have never heard back on any of them.  My wife and other industry colleagues have voiced the same experience.

At this point, I just send any communication from Johnson and Johnson to the trash folder."
The recruitment for this job was poorly communicated. I received conflicting e-mails from various HR groups.  Frankly one group suggested as interview was coming while the internal consumer HR group suggested they had a pre-picked candidate. 
Give feedback to their candidates as soon as the company has a decision about the process.
"Out of the hundreds of times I applied for a position at J&J., very few times have I ever heard back for them.   By the law of averages, I should have been hired by them long ago.  I have applied many times over 10 years for positions where have 10+ years of experience in and exact match to my skill sets, industry tenure and therapeutic area expertise.  Never even got a request for a phone interview.    Nothing and no reply ever.   Applying there is a black hole."
Also consider candidates with less experience but that are genuinely motivated.
"Provide an answer more quickly. This application took a very long time. I thought I was not considered and that the e-mail that said so was forgotten to be sent, but a few months later I got the e-mail."
"Give a response to the applicant about his/her status and the reasons why he/she didn't go further in the recruitment process, when it's apply."
Send an update
"It would be nice to have more transparency into the process.  I'm curious how you can get a rejection letter a few days after applying, yet the position shows as actively recruiting several weeks later.  Or perhaps showing # applicants at each stage."
"i did not get passes CV screening point, some feedback on this would be useful, however I know that this is not possible. I feel that the rejection was quite generic, however it was useful to know that I was not successful."
Also consider candidates with less experience but that are genuinely motivated.
Allow me to interview

More communication 
"Although I applied for the Manager, Site Services position I was never contacted by a recruiter.  Four different J&J employees viewed my LinkedIn, but I was not contacted.  Several months later I receive a letter via email that I am no longer being considered for the position.  That was a surprise because I never spoke to anyone, never had an interview so I did not know how I was even being considered.  I would hope that a company as reputable as J&J would have a more engaging recruiting process than going to LinkedIn.  What I know about J&J from family and friends that have worked to retire from J&J, this one experience has not changed my view of the company; hence the high rating.  Thank you for the opportunity to participate in your survey."
"Went for an interview last year as well after meeting the hiring manager, then HR. However there was nothing, complete no news even after following up a few times with the HR manager."
"Some recruiters are better than others, but the importance is making sure you have closed the loop for all candidates; i.e. providing clear feedback and direction - where they are in the process, what the next step is, why they have not received feedback yet, why they were not considered, etc. I have interviewed for positions where I never receive verbal or written notification that I did not get the job offer. I contacted the recruiter a number of times and was told I should contact the interviewer instead of the recruiter. That should be the recruiters responsibility to make sure the process has closer, not the person being interviewed."
Personal contact would improve the process.
"I am a seasoned administrative assistant with excellent references (all JNJ Sr. Directors or above).  I have 15 years of experience at JNJ.  I have applied countless times to a multitude of positions.  I am never called by any recruiter for any of the positions I apply.  I am also referred by other JNJ Employees----

I am considered retired, but am eligible for rehire----I am ""wondering"" if because the recruiters see my retired status that they think this makes me old?  I retired ONLY because I had the right combination of years and service when I left the co and so am automatically considered retired.

Please reconsider people like me who have a lot to offer JNJ.

Thank you,

Mary Collins"
Actually do it. 
Be genuinely fair.
"Spending a bit more time upfront mapping out the timeline and interviewing process would be helpful.  I think there is value in being very, very open here particularly with internal hires as often current functional management is interested.  It can be difficult to project timing upwards."

"Dear Director – Human Resource,
Janssen Research & Development LLC,
Spring House, Pennsylvania,
USA.

Thank you for soliciting the feedback.

I’ve applied for Senior Director, Immunology Strategy & Operations Leader (9023161025) position on 10th March 2017. Since then (more than 2 months), apparently I have had no communication and/or an alert from J&J on either consideration (or) rejection on the suitability of candidature. 

It is fair to give an equal importance for the applicants both that are suitable (or) non-suitable as a feedback within a specific period of time. I’m sure this will be a very candid way to handle and attract the talent for this and future positions.

I hope this helps.

Best wishes,

However, when you apply for 2 years to multiple jobs and you know that many of them you warrant at least a phone call and you never get one, then you think the recruiting process is a joke.  That all the J&J team does is put the job advert out as a statistical obligation with no real intent to hire outside the J&J family.  This becomes very discouraging."

"J&J is not timely about alerting candidates to the outcome of their search process.  I applied to a position in June, and was not informed that i hadn't been selected until April of the next year.  This timeline was extremely extended, and there had been no communication in the middle.  "
Reach out more to potential hires. 
"1.  Fix your website -  I didn't apply to this position via your website.  I learned of it and contacted one on my former colleagues who is an associate director at J&J.  He recommended me for the position, learned who the recruiter was and put me in contact with her.  She initially contacted me via email and requested I apply online to start the process.  I tried using 3 different ID/PW combinations and was unable to access the site to complete an application.

2.  Require your recruiter to communicate with applicants (especially those they interview) - I eventually had a phone interviewed with the recruiter.  I believe it was about 2 months ago.  I was told at the end of the interview that she would write up her notes on the interview and submit them to the hiring manager.  I have yet to hear what was decided although since months have passed I assume I was not going to be considered further for the position.

3.  Don't go through motions - The feeling I got very early during my phone interview, was that before we even had begun speaking that the recruiter had already decided on someone else for the position and/or she didn't think my skills/experience were a match for the position.  I had the sense that she was interviewing me perhaps because I had been recommended for the spot by a director or that she had a quota of interviews she needed to fill for the position.  Although this was for a part-time spot, if I were interested in a full time position, based on my skills and experience, I would be hired at least at an associate director level and most likely would have people report to me.  This experience has me wonder if higher level people are treated this way how are those at lower levels treated and how are higher levels expected to treat their reports.

I'm at the stage of my career and fortunate to be in the position where I no longer need to work.  I choose to continue working on a part-time or project basis because I want to remain mentally stimulated and would like to use my skills and experience to mentor and help develop those early in their career.  With all I read and hear in the press and news about companies not being able to fill positions due to a lack of talent I was surprised by my experience and that J&J didn't seem to value what I have to offer.  I would have thought that even if the recruiter (or hiring manager) didn't think I was the right person for this position the recruiter would have suggested other more appropriate spots so J&J could benefit from what I could contribute to the company."
"Provide some feedback, period.  I have applied for several positions, but the recruiters are extremely difficult to contact.  I have attempted to get in contact with recruiters via email and phone (though not for this particular position) daily...with no reply, only to have the posting closed while they fail to respond."

"To clarify, the process was not bad, but my last interview was terrible.  She was very condescending, uninterested, and seemed to get upset over ""feedback"" that I received over a decade ago when I was at J & J.  On top of that, when I asked for feedback regarding the interview, I was told that none could be provided.  The hiring manager wanted ME, so did the district members.  This lady for whatever reasons seems to really enjoy the power that comes with her Eastern Region Business Director's title.  23 years in the medical sales industry, and I have never been so embarrassed and humiliated by someone's complete lack of professionalism.  Good luck in the future, J & J is a great company that I wanted to come back to in oncology, but that woman made sure that I would not get the chance."

"Unfortunately, the role I applied for was put on hold.  

It was naturally disappointing to find this out at the end of the interview process, which consisted of: an initial telephone interview, a series of psychometric and mathematical online tests, a presentation of a case-study under timed conditions with a face to face interview with the UK & US, and a telephone interview with the US after 2 previously failed attempts waiting online for my interviewer to join the call (due to issues with internal communication). 

However, I had a very helpful follow-up call from the hiring manager and I fully understand and appreciate the circumstances that led to the role being put on hold. I still hold JnJ in very high regard and respect the decisions made. I would definitely recommend JnJ to others and would welcome the opportunity to join the company in the future."
"I was never contacted by a recruiter or given the opportunity to interview despite meeting or exceeding your qualification requirements.  I have to assume, then, that my age (64) was the primary factor for being rejected by the recruiter."

J&J is not unique in this issue, and I don't have a solution with the use of automatic candidate screening tools out there, but I think companies that don't take the time to review candidates miss out on good talent."
I was never screened or interviewed for this job.  I was not contacted or updated after I posted for the position... this survey is a bit odd to me.

Be more transparent with an individuals fit in the company.  For this position I had significant credentials for the job however there may have been an another plan for me from the beginning.
"
I did not get any feedback and I did not go through the interview, it was like I did not send a resume, I did not understand why I was selected to evaluate something I did not participate in."
if possible try to give the candidate their feedback so that they can also make themselves more competitive in the future 
"It would have been professional if someone had bothered to contact me to let me know that I was not being considered for the position.

This was not a low level position and it should have been attended to with more consideration that was given.

I am quite surprised and disappointed in the handling of the situation.

"Make the process faster, it takes too long until the first reply.

Give some feedback, I only got a very generic reply."
"To see is to beleive; may be on documents a candidate couldnt exaplin what he/she is capable of. You must atleast meet up to know more thoroughly. 

A little secret to tell to is that many times much of an educated with alot certificates isnt that much of revenue generator than a normal candidate 🙂🙂

For this you can start round table meet ups with candidates who think they r fitting on the very position; just a little chit chat and you can better scrutinize among them 😉

All da best for short listing 😀 

Good day!

"As a candidate, I'd like to receive some return about my participation in seletive process and also receive feedback with the reason to not fit the position."

"No person from J&J HR ever spoke to me, emailed me, or contacted me.
I was highly qualified for the position, and yet I never heard at all.

Overall J&J appears to take the human out of human resources.  The process it used relied on email... realize that the email address this is sent to is barely monitored (it is used only for job searches, depending on how many recruiters I SPEAK to would depend on how often I check, and the emails from JNJ look like spam- every time it is asking me to take a survey before I speak to a PERSON.

In the end I took a job with Ford Motor Company even though the J&J position on paper was much better.

"
More personal
I have been contacted twice via telephone by the same person. The phone line during the first call was so poor that I could barely hear or understand the recruiter. He did not seem to know what he was doing or what questions to ask. The call ended abruptly with the recruiter saying he was going to contact the Sydney office for feedback on a previous attempt at gaining employment with J&J last year. The second time the recruiter called me he didn't remember that he had called me less than two weeks earlier. Again the phone line was poor and echoed. The recruiter came across as not really having read my application or resume nor knew what questions he wanted to ask. I have received no further feedback relating to my application and am very disappointed and disillusioned with the whole application process and how the recruitment team handle the process. What seemed like an excellent job opportunity which I believe I could excel at has left me wondering what is expected of employees of J&J. The whole process came across as disorganized and I felt that it was impossible to progress to a face to face interview with the team in South Australia. I would have liked to have seen the facility and meet some of the team members in Adelaide.

"The My Next Step Portal can be improved greatly.  I tried to search for a position by Req# and 3 different jobs came up, none of which were the position I was looking for.

That the process is closer
I am a highly respected Senior FSE with decades of hands on experience. Not once was I contacted by anyone within J&J.
"Give some feedback on the position.  All I get is a rejection email.  It would be nice to know where they are in the hiring process; and it would be nice to at least get a phone call if I meet the requirements.  My applications seem to go into a ""black hole"", and then I get a rejection email. "

Venho buscando uma oportunidade de trabalho na J&J, mas me sinto excluído, apesar de ter um currículo muito bom, que eu sei que é, mas por preconceito, discriminação, exclusão, eu não tenho uma única oportunidade de sequer participar dos processos. Não adianta nem indicação de colaboradores, que mesmo assim não sou chamado.

Sinto uma tristeza profunda, pois a J&J é a empresa dos meus sonhos, a empresa que sempre esteve na minha vida, mas por causa de pessoas que já estão dentro, meu sonho virou um enorme pesadelo, que dói muito, muito... Nem amor próprio eu tenho mais, pois se o tivesse deixaria de insistir com quem não me quer."

"I have approached J & J directly twice via direct applications in last 5 years and never been called in. Meanwhile during my recent direct application I did come into interview for another opportunity for role of Operations Coordinator & Analyst through an agency as a contractor. The office building and location is very pleasant. However I am disappointed in J & J as they just do not seem to be organised at all. How can an applicant make a direct application and yet get called in via an agency for another role. The interview process was poor as the interviewer had only 40 mins slot and part of it was a presentation. Having put in significant effort for presentation I felt it was a waste of time because the expectation was not sensible. I was asked last minute for access experience which was not even listed on my CV. Bottom line I think J & J need to be clear about their analytical needs, have sensible budgets as £220 day rate is terrible. Make the interview process longer and only ask for a presentation if it useful to you otherwise it really is a waste of time and effort. Candidates have to put a lot of effort in to set up a presentation. I do not think J & J as approaching again for me our any member of my family and friends. Hugely disappointed in the process of J & J "

"Dear Sir/Madam,

Quick summary on my background.  I have been in the IT industry for over 25 years, and engaged in the areas of IT service management, system integration, and consulting for large multinational companies and industries.  I can leverage on my extensive IT experience to contribute and value add to an organization such as J&J. However ...

I am writing to express my disappointment in the poor communication I endured via J&J recruitment process in Asia. After numerous attempts (over half dozen) applying for opportunities in Singapore and taking numerous online assessment tests, NOT one courtesy phone call from any of J&J recruiters on why my background was not a good fit nor status of my application. Only communication was a standardized form rejection letter sent via email many months after the initial application.  In short, my poor survey feedback reflects my frustration with J&J talent acquisition team and recruitment process.

Thanks"

"Make the recruitment process less time consuming and clearer from the start. I was in the process for weeks and did over 5 interviews with 8 different people as well as a case study and a logical mathematical test. And had I passed the math test there would have been at least another interview more. I understand J&J wants the best of the best but it did get to a point where I wasn't even sure if the company was right for me. I do have to say that all the people I interviewed with were great and did make me think more favourably about the company, so in other words the recruitment process was the one who left a sour taste about the company as it felt over complicated."
I never received any feedback on the performance of my video interview .  An email to inform the candidate about the outcome is essential.

J&J should get in contact with the participant and clearly explain the reasons why they choose or not a person and being fair too. And being also available to answer to questions. 
Maybe add a little more a reason why the application failed?
look into what the person can offer
It would be good to start with the contact with the candidate
Get a new recruiter. 
At least reply to the application
"From one side, I appreciated to receive an answer about the hiring team choosing not to pursue my candidacy for the position. On the other if the answer comes at less than 24 hours from applying, it indicates that my candidacy was even not taken seriously, specially if the answer is an automatic and impersonal e-mail with no reasons.

This certainly discourages the professional to apply for other job openings that could be posted as it confirms that without the personal approach it could be a waste of time for both sides.

A best practice from companies is to contact briefly to know the motivation and why the candidate considers himself a good fit to the vacancy due to the fact that a 2 pages CV can't indicate with all the extend the experience and skills for a very specific position. I'm aware about the workload of recruiters and the possibility of high amount of applicants, on the other hand and specially when the position is supposed to be senior/executive and therefore the applicant has also a certain seniority, it could be interesting from the recruiter and respectful to the applicant to know what he/she can means for the success of the position and company.

Yours faithfully

Sometimes CVs do not fully display your capabilities and core competencies which causes the rejection of candidate appointment though candidate believes himself fully fit for applied job. I think their should be a mechanism where candidate receive a chance to interact with recruiter to share all where he is unable to mentioned to his CV.  
Must be a better way to make sure you are getting the best talent.

"more transparency on the process and potential ""preferred"" candidates. Provide quality feedback. My experience with the feedback:

* I only got a call from the recruiter once I had reached out proactively myself (as it had taken almost a month after the interview and I still did not hear anything)

* Provide transparent and honest feedback and encourage the hiring manager to do so as well. I got a 1 min call from the recruiter with a non-substantiated feedback on why I was not considered and the hiring manager even did not bother to call me...Very, very, very disappointed in the whole process with no respect for the people who went through the effort of applying. "
"the company should provide feedback about the reason, why the candidate is not good for the position."
At least reply why someone is not fit for the job.Or Johnson and Johnson just consider people who have internal reference.
"Experience needs and dynamism to take care of eye. If the interviewed candidate's talents are not sufficient for the position they are referring to, they should be evaluated if they meet different position criteria."
They can at least reply to the applicant if they are not selected through. I have applied to a couple of fortune 500 companies who have replied to my application even it was a NO! How about a little professionalism towards applicant!
Keep the candidate informed in a timely fashion. I received notification for 6 months even though I was an internal JNJ candidate
"I hope that a reputed company like Johnson & Johnson have an advanced and better recruitment process.Myself wishing to be a part of this firm.Wishing you all the best,Thank you."
Ensure that structured interviews are used rather than open discussions of just CV. As just using open discussion with no set questions makes it impossible to assess candidates fairly. Also taking notes at the interview would be a good idea. Plus feedback was very ropey and was quite ageist. Not changing interviews at short notice would be good.  Overall the experience was quite unsatisfactory given J&Js reputation I was quite shocked that these things are not done.
"Sincerely I'm really surprised to receive a survey for a position I applied for but I'm apparently discarded with no communication, e-mail, phone call or something else. For sure J&J recruitment process should be reviewed in their communication workflow, attention to the people that try to join J&J family and take more in consideration certain CV discarded without investigation.

So would be a nice idea to give some more clarity why my job application was declined"

"This is the second survey I've received for a position where I did not have any interviews.  I had already accepted another position within J&J and at the same time, did not speak to anyone (HR or the hiring manager) about this position.  Given that, I felt the communication was extremely poor, as I received multiple conflicting emails about the process, next steps, etc (for which I was not involved!!).  Better organization is needed on the part of the Talent Acquisition team."
Try looking at the actual CV by a person and not through search software.  You will be missing out on some great talent by using a software to review the CV.
"I have received a feedback regarding the fact that my candidature will not take in account for the position but I have received no explanation regarding why mu candidature did not fit with the job opening. I know that is difficult to manage, but it would be great also to have information on why I'm not the right candidate in order to understand how to improve my skills."
More communication and more timely communication
"At least send candidates a email,etc to inform them that the vacancy has been filled or that they did not qualify for interviews.  Do not let candidates not get any Response from the recruitment team"
"The recruitment interface is not really easy to manage...in particular when we want to upload new resume and covering letter for an offer we can by accident delete the resume and covering letter of the other offers.

Moreover, it is sad that we do not have any feedback and that we receive an automatic email... after 4 or 5 months! It would be great that a recruiter gives the reason why we were not chosen."

"I cannot say much based on the experience during this particular job application process. After applying, I only received a (probably automated) email from the recruiter, stating that the team has chosen not to pursue my candidacy for the position. No feedback on particular areas of weakness was provided, or a reson for me not being a good fit. I think that more information on this topic would have been useful (particularly for my personal development). So, I would advise to offer at least some sort of feedback to applicants regarding the reason for not being selected. My opinion regarding JNJ is favorable overall (after all, I have been working here for eight years), but regarding the talent promotion and people development, as well as recruitment processes, I consider JNJ's approach to be below average."
I think more specific feedback when not going further in the selection process would be highly appreciated and helpful for subsequent applications.
"The interviewer Demir Baalzi started the interview like ---You are the last to be interviewed any way go ahead, I don't have any previous interviewing experience so just go a head....
The interviewer Baalzi is from a sales background having no experience in Engineering/manufacturing either but assigned to select candidate for a manufacturing position.
Though i had 10 years of Engineering background he picked one particular part of my career and started the interview by commenting that ----you got  only 3 years experience...
Overall he sounded like a Clueless Jealous racist."

More communication regarding job status and notify candidates when they ar enormous selected. Was contacted by a recruiter for a different position. This survey is how I know I was not selected for a position.

"I did not receive any written feedback or a phone call during 3 weeks after the interview with Customer Service Manager Agata Zygmunt. That interview took more that 2 hours and I believed that I am a strong candidate to the post. After 3 weeks I sent an e-mail to J&J recruiter Karolina Strzyminska asking her about feedback on the process and the interview. The answer I got was very general: ""we can not offer you a job"". I sent another e-mail asking her about more details and I got the answer: we chose other person who has broader experience in managing people. I feel it was just an evasion. My experience in managing people was indicated in the application and therefore I perceive this process as very unprofessional."
"The recruitment process is one of the worst in JNJ, you keep on applying without any feedback, they come on campus present the opening you apply and then everything silent, it took JNJ 8 months to send me a rejection for a position. 

This is really bad, and is not appreciated."
"To be truly fair I didn't participate to any recruitment process, I just applied to a position. I presume that if you didn't contact me further it was because we weren't a match.  I scored you with 7 at the last question because I am not in the position to recommend a company just after applying to one of it's positions. "
They must provide the opportunity to conduct at least brief cognitive talks with those responsible for the position for which they are candidates

"I never spoke to anyone about any position at Johnson & Johnson.  If the recruiter would have spoken to me directly, they would have had a much different view.

I know how to approach doctors and other healthcare providers and I can keep them happy, well-informed and well-supplied with anything that they require.  I am at the point where I can travel.

"It will be great if recruiters reach out to candidates and take time to go over the work experience and reasons why they apply for a given position.  I realize that at times this becomes almost impossible when receiving too many applicants for the same position.  Nevertheless, the personal contact is vital to learn more the applicant than just a resume.  Just a five minutes conversation with those potential candidates could reveal so much information which will help the recruiter identify the best candidate to consider inviting for the interview.  "

"Dear Team,

I think the Human Resources Department should focus on the experience before examining the resumes according to the applicants schools. Many global companies are eliminating the resumes according to the graduated university of candidate and state university graduates are losing their chances in the first stage, no matter how experienced they are.

In my opinion, this is the biggest mistake because they are not able to see the people who really want this job.

"Hi,
I understand that it is difficult to give feedback to all candidates who apply. However, it would make a tremendous difference for candidates to understand where their weaknesses are and in order to work towards achieving the requirements that are needed to work in a renowned organization like J&J.
At the moment, I still don't understand why my profile was not considered, given my background and experience. But I am less likely to come back in the future and apply for a role at J&J that may be even more suitable, because I don't know what J7J is looking for.
My recommendation would be to reach out to experienced & qualified candidates and provide honest feedback to candidates that have been recommended for a role by an internal J&J employee.
I'd be delighted to get your honest feedback in case this changes your mind. My name is Alexander Metlewicz (alex.metlewicz@gmail.com) and I applied for the Business Insights Manager role that you just posted on linkedin again. I'd be happy to share my latest CV with you if this is an option.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

If applicants demonstrate all the qualifications required for their respective job, they should get a chance for an interview where recruiters can check their eligibility giving them role play, educational background and all other things which recruiters required from applicants for the available position.
Having gone through Resume and deciding that applicants are not suitable for job is the thing which HR team should rethink.

"Dear Sir,
This is from my personal experience. I understand that initial automated screening is essential for any globally recognized company, where recruitment is a large scale and expanded process. But, I would like to suggest that this automated software should be made much more robust in order to consider the candidature. For example, in the case of scientists/researchers where an individual may have a different interdisciplinary background but has worked in the relevant field should be considered. There may also be a situation where some researcher has done a basic research, the application of which is in different companies like oil and gas, cosmetics, medicine etc., but just because the software couldn't identify the role/keywords in somebody's profile, the individual is not shortlisted. Please understand that everybody doesn't have a personal connection to forward the application.
I expect that the above point would help the recruiters improve their initial automated screening process. Thanks for considering my viewpoint.
Thanks,

By detailing the recruitment process and deadlines to candidates
Be fair...
"1- Recruiter should at least inform the person on what ground he was not selected.
2- All the Organization including Johnson & Johnson should have a fair recruitment process, as in if an old employ / Managerial position have refereed some on some person in trust is hired.and the person who is really capable always wait for his turn which never comes."
"Once profile will be shortlisted, candidate can be contacted through phone."
"Must assess the candidates according to the ""unique"" experiences, skills and background he/she possesses. Not according to his/her nationality. Sponsoring for a work permit must not be an issue for a global company like J&J. You're missing the opportunities. J&J's mission is making diversity but you're not acting like making it.."

"The improvement in the recruitment process could have a good start by providing a reason why candidate is not a good fit for the position he applied to because we may be very close to go further in the process but we do not know what is still missing to succeed.
Just send automatic replies or questions do not reflect transparency, independent process or a good job being done to get the best candidate.
Additionally, J&J should inform when starts and finishes the process.
On the other hand, the first filter has to be made by the one (senior) who is responsible for and is demanding the required professional because he will be able to fully understand the skills presented in the resumé to correctly fulfill the position, then go to the others to share point of views and to step ahead!

Interview process  should influence the canditate.No biasing sholud be there by the person who is taking the interview. 
Describe the type of student you are looking for. Respond in ample time if you are interest of not. I don't even remember when I applied for this position. Provide feedback as to why students weren't considered in the initial application process and after interviews. This will help students identify in what area they can improve on. It is important that even thing is a learning process and they individual can develop with each experience.

"you can inform people if they have not been successful, I have applied for several jobs and all I get are these surveys, of course after 2 or 3 of them without even one line to say I have not been successful my opinion of J&J is rock bottom. It appears to me if you can send these surveys, you can inform candidates that they haven't been successful. Are you more interested in surveys than candidate satisfaction?"
The Johnson & Johnson recruiter must contact the prospective employer in order to provide him the reasons why wasn't apply for the position. 
I think interview process is not fair.
"I really enjoyed hearing back from the recruitment process, regardless on whether or not I was moved forward in the application process. It takes great respect to send applicants updates on positions they are seeking. Many companies leave people in the rough to eventually just assume they were not chosen for the position.

Provide more personal contact with the applicants.  The current process is very impersonal and computerized.  Also the impersonal computer interview which has glitches can be improved. 
Have recruiters reach out to candidates and discuss why they are not considered for interviews.
"Be willing to interview talented people who are a bit outside the box. E.g. I have a Ph.D. in physics from Cornell (Harvard undergrad) plus significant new business development experience at a global 500 chemical company, but could not even get a phone interview. JNJ is an amazing company that does a ton right when it comes to innovation -- if only it could apply those principles to its recruitment process..."
Please provide the details for reasons for not being selected. I've received rejections that your resume doesn't make you not suitable for this position. Instead it would be better if you provide technical reasons and how to improve it. This will make a candidate to prepare accordingly. As Johnson & Johnson is prestigious company everyone will have a goal to work in it. I think the clarity in recruitment is the utmost important.

I would recommend more of a commitment to communication would help prospective candidates.  The overall process and length of time from application to notification (if ever) is so lengthy that an applicant does not feel valued.
"i know it would be too difficult to do but I know the no reply your skills don't fit the position you applied for are automatic. I just wish I knew how I can actually get to speak to a real person and get an opportunity to interview with the team. My qualifications are what most positions are asking for and yet I still don't get a call.  It's so disheartening but, I'm going to keep trying because I am really interested and hopeful to become part of your team.  I would be a great asset and investment to the organization.  Give me the opportunity to speak to you in person. 

Thank you for including me in this survey!

I hope to hear from you soon. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,

I, being a experienced Demand planner , mainly FMCG and Consumer electronics,  was disappointed with JnJ's selection process.

Prior to this, I always held JnJ in high esteem, presuming it to be professional, clear and transparent in its selection process.

"As I stated before in a previous survey, I would love to have phone contact with someone from the recruitment department. Other than contacting an employee here, or there on LinkedIn. (Gary Workman is one), I have never heard from anyone. I have applied to many positions in outside sales in Chicagoland area. I would love to work for your company, but I have never once been contacted by a recruiter from J & J. I only receive the automated rejection email back. It is disheartening to receive these, but I will not give up. I know I have the credentials to at least be asked in for an interview. Please take this as constructive criticism. I would love to work for J & J, but feel they are missing out on really good candidates with their current recruitment process."

"The recruitment process at J&J could be improved substantially by actually  valuing the experience, work ethic and acumen of applicants who have outperformed their peers for more than 3 decades.  Demonstrate they truly value cultural diversity by interviewing and hiring individuals that fall outside the demographics of 25-40 years of age, have more than 5 years of industry experience and more than 3 jobs since graduating college.  Those screening applicants and hiring managers at J&J bypass a lot of talent by assuming applicants with more experience that the demographics mentioned would not be interested in or remain very long at a job with a salary range of the posted position.  I understand those reading my response will likely be inclined to dismiss my recommendations as they are the response from dismissed applicant.  Perception is often reality; I've shared my perspective and perception because you asked... that at least is a step in the right direction.  I wish the employees at J & J well. "

Receiving an e-mail to take a survey is how I found out I was not selected for the positions I applied to.  I do not find that an effective means of communication.

There should be telephonic conversations and fast communication.

Not base applicant's chances of getting the job on applicant's grades.

1. Please answer or contact the applicant and give the reason why he/ she is not fit for the position.
2. Give chance to other candidates who is eager and willing to work in your company.

I am sure they are willing and excited to be trained. Let them develop their other skills and help them reach their goals and objectives.

"To Whom It May Concern, 
                                          I have never seen such discrimination in my life before. I am an avid user of your products since infancy. I have a strong background in business development in Japan and have worked for such companies as Apple, Meisekimu, AGM and have created large investments and products within Japan. Having been keen to work for your company and help expand brand awareness and marketing strategies after seeing the ad, I thought I can bring my expertise and skills to help J&J further expand in Japan by bridging the gap also having a western person with Japanese business development skills and experience.

Yet your companies lack of professionalism to grant me that chance, yet alone an interview, shows the people behind the chain of command lacks the dignity and respect your company has been and should be known for. Yet hiring someone else which most likely has zero experience and barely speaks a word of English or has the strong business acumen needed for this particular role. Perhaps you should wake up, as even online there has been a lot of negativity geared towards your company regarding condescending treatments and discrimination on all basis.

When you decide to show respect by all means show it, or should the Japanese media get to learn your true colors? 

When you decide to respect people and show some dignity and respect by all means do contact me again raymondgeorgejp@gmail.com

Thanks for nothing!

I heard nothing for months.

have phone conversation 
Better communication and m9re feedback foe those who really like your company and truly have an interest to work for you! 
The hiring manager needs to better communicate with the recruiter. The recruiter offered the position as a Regular Full Time Position but the hiring manager told me the position was a temp only. It seems like the hiring manager just changed his mind on the status of the job without communicating to anyone . Definitely not very professional (at least not the JNJ style I was used to work for).                                                                                                 disappointed...
"I don't know if I'm considered or rejected for the position I applied for. Johnson & Johnson just emailed me about this survey without telling me first the status of my application.

So maybe my comment will be please be clear with your emails about job application status prior to let the applicants answer this survey.

Thank you."
"I had an interview 3-4 weeks ago and was told I'd hear back within a week. I didn't hear back after the week and followed up with the initial recruiter if a decision was made and I still haven't heard anything back. It reflects poorly on the company and individual as it didn't seem professional when I was specifically told I'd hear back within a week, be it good or bad. I'd just like feedback for the timeline and a reason why I was not a good fit so I am not waiting or wondering. Please provide feedback to potential employees/applicants as that helps us improve ourselves. "
 Improve time on feedback.
No comments.
"Process is good, people involved are pleasant, presentation is clear and attractive, maybe just the timings for application in different locations is a bit unclear. I wouldn't recommend to apply to people from my country because the company only seeks for the region of work eligibility and for Russians it is usually a problem, so it is logical to conclude that company is not interested in Russian talents."
I felt like my resume was not even considered as I received a rejection email almost immediately.  I would likely not apply to Johnson and Johnson again nor would I recommend anyone to apply.  It's hard to find work and the process often makes applicants feel defeated.
"Many companies use automated responses. Hearing why I was not a good candidate with my 20 years of experience in the specific area confuses me. I think maybe an English BA is seen as a weakness as compared to science but 20 years of on the floor and on the road  is real life in patient safety and quality of life issues.  I do not understand why I have not been even interviewed. I have been told I am over the top with regard to compliance and audit readiness and the company does not want or cannot support that much compliance effort? Really? Well, then enjoy the 9 or 10 digit fines from the FDA."
At least to update on the status of application.
Better communication with candidates
"If I was not a fit, let me know immediately via an automated email.  I don't expect a recruiter to call me to let me know that I was not a good fit.  At lease an email from the career portal to let me know that I was not a good fit...not after 4-5 months after the initial application."
"I have applied to several positions at Johnson & Johnson (as well as Janssen Pharmaceuticals). I have not been contacted by a recruiter or other talent acquisition professional representing Johnson & Johnson. If I have been considered for a position with either company, I have not been aware of it."
" the recruiter asked personal questions, not very professional, I had one interview with the director and I believed that it went very well and told me that I should receive another call for a panel interview. Never received any feedback nor any Calls. It was disappointing specially from a big corporate company such as Johnson and Johnson. "
"I did not have a face to face interview, so I am not sure why this was sent"
"All the process are good ,however a feedback has to be provided to a candidate if a profile is on hold.
Thanks"
Recruitment and hiring is a very personal thing. You should try having people involved in the process rather than just relying on software.

"Do it. Apart from this survey request, I didn't received absolutely any communication about my application, positive or negative. None. For me j&j end up been like a ghost company."

The recruitment process is very lengthy and no one ever gets back to you to tell you that you were not selected and the reason
Encourage J&J in all countries to use this database as primary source.
"Actually, I was not contacted by a recruiter at all. I just received an email 24 hrs after submission saying that i did t fit the requirements. I assume that my resume is not making it past the filters. "
"I applied for this position with high hopes, but unfortunately I was never contacted by the recruitment team. Infact, months later when I applied, I just received an automated email informing that I was unsuccessful.

I believe it's a good idea to contact the candidates informing them why they were selected or not selected for further interviews. I completely understand that you must receive hundreds of applications, but given the brand name of J&J and it's marking standing among customers (who happen to be applicants also), it's not much to ask for. "
Personal communication would be my recommendation 
Send more details about how are going the process in terms of candidates
"If this is a part of a human capital management improvement, I could say there is still a lot to improve. As I applied for seven position I have only five replies, not bad, but for those two position that don't have reply it would be eternal waiting if only those two positions I have applied for. Though automation is vital in achieving a quality hiring process still manual intervention is the appropriate solution as AI has not gone at par with manual assessment."
It would be effective for recruiters to pass along the resumes to the hiring managers.  I have worked with recruiters in my previous roles and noticed that often they don't understand the lingo in the job experience in a resume and pass along good candidates because they don't understand what the lingo means compared to the job descriptions.  
"Maybe a better screening process, might help you narrow down the applicant pool a little better so you can build an interpersonal connection with the pre-selected applicants."
After being a part of Johnson & Johnson's community they should update us for new requirement.
I did not hear anything from them at all 
Make a call or write an email
I think if you can provide a debriefing on why a strong candidate didn't get a chance to interview or list what was the candidate shortcoming in an email.
Shorten application to disposition time. Provide some feedback as to why I was rejected. Provide other roles for which I may be qualified.
"I have applied several position and I have never been contacted by the recruiter.

You people must give chance to overseas professional candidates as well who has average exposure... Sometimes polishing the medium or average candidates becomes very good asset to the company...
"Entendo que para melhorar o processo, inicialmente devem nos retornar com feedback claro para os candidatos, colocando de forma objetiva quais foram os pontos negativos ou positivos sobre sua participação e o esclarecimento dos próximos passos do recrutamento, isso gera respeito e também gera admiração por parte do candidato para continuar a buscar novas oportunidades na empresa por acreditar na eficaz do processo, em uma empresa tão respeitada e admirável como a Johnson. Vejo uma grande oportunidade este contato para melhor conhecer os candidatos, isso ajuda a ter melhor análise de alguns pontos importantes para esclarecer o perfil do candidato e gera transparência e credibilidade nos processos realizados pela vossa companhia."
Better communication during the steps of interview process. And feedback after the interview would be helpful.  
Quicker Response and a feedback for why not fit / selected
Yes
A form letter to legitimate prospect does not give anyone a warm fuzzy feeling about the company.
NON
I believe that JnJ has a good recruitment process.
"The process where I can see is good enough, but sometimes I would like to understand why the requirements does not match with my skills, in general the process is very good."

Before I became Merck's Finance Liason for its joint ventures in North America and Europe with J&J, the relationship was one of no trust on either side.

"As a former J&J employee with marketing experience in the pharmaceutical industry, I was expecting ""better"" treatment from J&J TA.  But, I get very little contact from TA and even less help or personal assistance.  

J&J cancels positions if they don't get dozens of candidates, which is even more annoying.  J&J is a very smug company, and reorganizes and moves even slower than before. J&J has forgotten The Credo long ago.

I have applied to dozens of jobs over the past four years, and gotten ONE interview at ETHICON NJ for my efforts.  It was just an EEO interview though, and I was not seriously considered, because I committed the sin of being unemployed at the time.    

A general waste of time...long applications, long waits and a huge HR department that just smiles a lot and doesn't do much for job seekers."
Recruiter didn't contact - despite of industry specific experienced 
Contact candidates to give a status on potential trial fit and give insight. 
I didn't speak to anyone but got an email saying they would not be moving forward.  Generic and probably auto generated.  It's fine and I was glad to get at least a response as I know how many applicants apply and the email certainly gives closure or an update at minimum!
"should talk to the people who applied & short listed.

Should see the qualifications & experience .

Thank you
"When a potential employee is referred by several current J&J employees for a role they are clearly qualified for, at a minimum, the potential employee deserves a face to face interview and if they do not get the role, the potential emoyee and those references deserve a follow-up."
This is the first communication I've had about this position. If someone tried to call I am currently out of the country and they didn't follow up via email which is the preferred method of contact. Maybe instead of sending surveys make sure that one has actually been contacted prior to being asked for an opinion. 
I never heard from a recruiter. I only received an email.
prompt and clear communication
"At least, you should update the candidate. "
"The process feels very impersonal. Surely there are qualified candidates that are being overlooked by the existing online system. Placing a face, voice, or identity to this process would soften the experience without lowering your standards.  Our society has enough automation, be unique, standout, and get personal.

Feedback should be given properly. Give the chance to higher degrees people to join your esteemed organization.
Personal contact with people who do the effort to apply is the best way to keep the company image high. Even if the answer is not positive people will appreciate the effort to contact them and will also learn what to improve if they know the reason why they are not selected.
Respond in a more timely manner.
"Follow up to let the interviewee know where they stand in the interview process- had 2 interviews the same day and then 3 weeks went by to then be notified by dm they had given an offer to an outside candidate ( I had emailed the dm to ask where I stood in the process or if they had moved on) then the recruiter called 2 weeks after that to say I didn't get the position- there should be more professional courtsey extended to candidates no matter where they stand in the process- I understand that another candidate was chosen and I didn't fit the criteria they were looking for but I expect a certain amount of respect and professional understanding that a candidate needs to know where they stand and if they are being moved on in the process or not- of all the interviews I have had in pharmaceutical industry in over 14 years, this was probably the most disappointing in the communication aspect- I expected more from a Johnson and Johnson company"
Contact me and let me know why I didn't get the job and what I can do to improve my chances in the future.  
"Let candidates know if a recruiter has actuallly reviewed my resume, and/or if the hiring manager ever reviewed the resume.

Surveying about experiences of each candidate and give chances to them as a first phase of interviews 
"Above all, I really like Johnson & Johnson's products. Because of that I hope to become a your worker as soon as possible. Just one thing I want is, if you inform me my current application status promptly, I will be thankful."
Personal Contact
I never heard anything from any one after applying for this position.
I selected a linkedin apply and provided my information. A few weeks later I got an email that another candidate was deemed better. Not much to say about the process good or bad. I have no idea if an actual person reviewed my application or gave it any consideration or if an automated system just rejected my application after a set amount of time. I understand it varies - it took me 6 months to hear from HP and similar for Siemens so I know that it takes time to vet and select a candidate. I would not apply for a job I did not want or did not think I was capably of performing to a high degree so I assume the person selected is more of a fit than I appeared. What more is there to say?  Thanks for asking for my opinion.
Inform the applicant as far as you can. At least the applicant know if they are qualified or the're some changes to be part of the company. 
speed up the process and be consistent on feedback. 
Follow up or explanation of reason for not pursuing candidacy -especially for internal employees would be good. For external talent TA should engage more alumni associations and professional networks to tap into experiences talent  - particularly alumni extensions of diverse networks. 
probably at least an initial phone interview to find out more about the candidate background and the ideal career path
Quicker response to application
"1st, contact people.No interview was given.No reason for being passed over.I met the candidate who got the recent position and i would like to know why someone with far less experience in EP got the job over others like me who have been doing this job for 23 years.I feel like age played a big factor.I would like to know the reasons behind their choices when I wasn't even given a interview.Thank you,Sheryl Juenger"
Everything seems good
"As a senior marketing leader who has worked with Johnson & Johnson for a number of years now, I am highly disappointed in your recruitment process. I have outstanding credentials with 15+ years of CPG experience working with J&J and almost every single of your competitors, 2 internal recommendations from existing J&J employees and even hired to work on a few freelance projects directly, but not once did any recruiter ever reach out for a conversation. "
"I am sorry to say, I haven't been invited to the interview process for the said role. I don't understand on why I have recieved this feedback link. Appreciate to have my doubts cleared.

Regards,
Venkat "
"Please provide feed back as to reason for not being considered for job.
Thanks"
At least provide reasons why are not being selected
update the candidate with the next step in the hiring process. Send emails of new openings and positions that would be a suitable match to their profile.
"Contact for an interview.
"
"Reduce the overall time it take to recruit... Currently, it is about 3 months... "
"I never heard back from anyone about the position I applied for. I may just be a number to your recruiting staff but this process is extremely important for those of us looking for a job and hoping to be placed into a position that is a good fit with a great company. I think the least companies can do is provide applicants with the outcome (good or bad) and provide feedback, if possible. "
"I think the recruitment process is good.
I think it would be better to inform to candidates the reasons they were not approved."
"At the very least, reach out personally."
Contact for an interview. 
Please discuss with candidate before conclusion. F2F will provide much broader view than CV.
More personal feedback
I never received a call from a recruiter.  
"Please reduce the usage of the ATS, its not giving a fool proof selection"
"The recruitment process is very good, and the details can be improved."
Increase transparency & feedback; allow candidates to respond to feedback to avoid misunderstanding.
Brief feedback that would help my future candidacy would have been greatly appreciated!
I was never even notified that the position had been filled. It would be great to have a link that provides the status of your application. 
If more detailed reason could be provided for not selecting a candidate or shortlisting a resume it would be much better.
I feel it was handled professionally and time efficiently.  I could only wish they could have opened up the position to an experienced Nurse as well as a prior experienced Clinical Educator.  Hope in the future to be considered for a similar job opportunity  in the future as positions open up with J&J.
"1) let the person applying know if they got the position or not since no one has contacted me.
2) I understand I am not a good fit based on the survey, it would be nice to know the reason why and how I could better myself for the future."
if the position it has been closed they should alert people faster. i havent gotten an answer for a position in a long time. so it would be nice to get an email explaining why people didnt get the position.   
Stop keyword based selection
There is not much you can do. The culture in Turkey is different than the States. Any recruiter you employ in Turkey will eventually revert back to the origins.
"1) let the person applying know if they got the position or not since no one has contacted me.
2) I understand I am not a good fit based on the survey, it would be nice to know the reason why and how I could better myself for the future."
Better feedback as to match of credentials and experience.
I have no idea why receive the survey considering I was never contacted for a follow up
no body contact me after my applications. i think my resume wasnt check property also not considered my experience.
Just the number 1 question
"Nobody contact me!
I want to work in J&J, but I never had an oportunitity."
"I guess understandably - to some extent - it's a cookie cutter process.
"
Timely feedback. 
"Open several job positions for elderly, experienced people."
"Johnson & Johnson is a fantastic company, and I would highly recommend, but I would advise them that they should not expect a timely response for either application or survey based on my experience."
Response please
"To open positions for elderly, experienced people."
"Advise if one is not a good fit, vs.no feedback at all."
"
I want to work with you, but it is complicated, because there is never any possibility of receiving a call, just as they are on my list of organizations that I have always wanted to work on, thanks"
At least  call the candidate for interview rather sending them mails so that the candidate believe in you it seems the you are sitting abroad enjoying doing mails while the people who are in recruitment in Indian are engagaging the people who are near and dear to them.
"Open positions for elderly, experienced people."
Feedback would be greatly appreciated.
"I find it difficult to get past the screeners, where the shortcomings are, if any. The PEOPLE part of the process often gets lost."
I think J&J is a great company and I would love to work there.  Although I was not chosen to interview for a position I would still recommend the company.  
I mentioned in my previous survey also. This is the only company I apply to that got back with me in no time. This is the best I have ever seen from any other company. I have applied for several of them so thank You J&J for having such a recruiting team where decisions are made and communicated this good.
"Be courteous and reply to applicants.  If there is specific feedback, then that should be provided, rather than a generic ""excuse"" (we are impressed by your qualifications, but have decided to move on to other candidates...)."
More timely updates and feedback on the recruitment results.
"It depends on the recruiter and the hiring manager or team. My opinion is that interviews should not be a set of standard questions, but a more personalized form. Every person has a different personality, and standard questionnaires can obscure a talent. "
"Sometimes, what stated in the resume is not all about the candidates. More chances should be given. 
However, we understand that it is done according to the recruitment procedures. 
Just hope that, one day, the recruitment process looks not only on the resume, but also more considerations are taken in the preliminary screening. "
"A feedback for an application, whether it's positive or negative should be given to applicant."
"please arrange technical test .

"
recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you ap
I can't hear about the reason why I not a good fit for the position
"READ the resume, for starters."
"Your process was very disappointing for such a reputable company. Just like most other sales jobs in the industry today their are nine million recruiters out there and always getting people to apply for jobs, yet you never talk to anyone half of the time. In the medical industry you need to speak to someone directly on the phone or face to face. A resume in Medicine and Health does not tell you a story or someone's true background or strengths and weaknesses. For instance mine is one. You guys are such a well rounded and reputable company, but your Recruiting process does not reflect it. With that being said, just because of how great of a company you are I will always be open to working with you. With that being said please keep me in mind, I live in South Florida, I'm a go getter with a Sales Background, I'm also an RN, BSN, and have served all my time in critical care/emergency/trauma, and I am always looking to settle down with a company such as yours.

"Habilidade pode ser ensinada a um profissional — um novo idioma, a operação de um novo sistema, uma nova linguagem de programação, mas ter caráter e ética não são passíveis de ensinamento.

To be brief either the candidates we're suitable for the position or not. Better be bold so the candidates don't expect a chance to be working in your company is he's not the right person you're looking for.
"Try to provide feedback in a timely fashion
Avoid leaving extremely negative experience such as not giving any updates till 6 months later, and only sent an system-generated email after 6 months. It makes candidates feel not appreciated for the time they spent."
"The true is that I only had an interview by teleconference however The recruiter did know exactly the position they were interviewing me and did not had any information about it.  they told me that would be calling me again, that never happened.

So I did not had feedback any Other call and any kind Of formal interview that I could present myself and the recruiter knows about muy experience because I am pretty sure that I could feet in the position.

Tks for your attention "
Please provide timely feedback if you can. It took more than a month for me to receive an email saying I was not a good fit. This was a month after the phone interview when I was told there would be second and possibly third interview.
"Response time to applications.  Actually,  I never received an email about my application on this questionnaire. "
Not send me surveys when I never even had a phone interview with them.

I can tell you that Taleo is really the worst I have seen from many different companies solutions. Please consider in the event future recruiting tools and processes are modified.

Respectfully,

The recruiterso could do a more professional job. 
Do better at contacting back about results of testing and interviewing
It would be great if candidates were able to track the application through the hiring process even if that includes excluding the candidate early on in the process.  
"Give more candidates a chance at an interview and a chance to learn J&J systems. It seems that if you don't have J&J systems experience, they don't even want to talk to you.  Some of us are fast learners and willing to learn the job, no matter what.  Any position I apply for which seems to be a great fit for me doesn't even bring forth a phone call or interview.
Getting tired of applying."
I want an interview. And then the job 
"This is the second job I applied for that I received this survey for. In both jobs, I was never contacted regarding the job until this survey. I think there is something broken in your recruiting process. "
"I never spoke with a recruiter, was never offered an interview, never given ANY feedback."
Provide feedback or follow up. I never got the rejection call or anything but we'll be back to you soon with decision. 
Assign someone to contact candidates.
"I really love everything about J&J. what you stand for, and have heard tons of great things about working there from former employees. I have been in the industry for over 7 years. I have been the top of every department I have worked for and been qualified for a great deal of positions that I have applied for at J&J.  Not once have I ever been allowed to even make it to the first part of the interview process.  Recently I have been told that the positions you post are not actual jobs and will be given to internal employees with no consideration of external candidates. this is frustrating for people who really want to part of a great organization."
"Every step of applying and hearing back regarding the position was very technical and automate. While I understand the high volume of applicants, it would be nice to know factors that contributed to being passed over as a candidate. I.e. Location, education, experience. 

The application process is time consuming and I would like to see companies including j&j offering a more humanistic application experience. "
"The only point I would like to suggest is to get clear the position, responsibilities and clarify the actual area structure."
"To tell the job seeker the reason ""Why not"""
I never interacted with J&J on the position.  Just received an email stating other candidates were selected.

I am glad to have an opportunity to provide feedback as my experience was a bit confusing. On April 4, 2017, I received an email stating I was not selected for the position. A few minutes later I received another email congratulating me that I had been referred and to take the next step to apply. However, when I clicked the link to do so it said the page no longer exists. The position was no longer listed as an open position on your career site either.  I attempted to follow up with Talent Acquisition but did not receive a response. I would love to know if I was being considered for the position as it would be encouraging for future, similar,  opportunities at JnJ. I love JnJ and had a wonderful experience working for you years ago. The skills and experience I have gained in my career since have truly elevated me professionally and I would be eager to share that with you in the future. Thank you in advance for a response.

It would be appreciated even though I am aware of the high volume of new candidates to at least see a email or a call why I was not selected.  You guys should have the habilita that if a candidate is not selected offer alternatives if any of employment with the enterprise. 
What you can do is provide more information for the feedback for the candidates...explain  in more detail why we were not selected for the requested position......Thank you..........
I have applied many times but I have not been contacted. I worked for J&J by 2 years from 2005-2007 at Cordis de Mexico.

"I suggest to be more open minded and give more interviews rather by just going with 10 years of experience on the paper. you might be amazed of the create force out there that are super passionate to create and market your brands. marketing is an art of creating and it requires an open mind but it seems like your company stick to one way of thinking only but regardless thank yoy for the automated rejection email and survey !

"I've never received feedback despite applying for a few positions.  I have friends that are VPs @ J&J - and while I could get a referral - I thought I would test out the recruitment/staffing process.  It has to this point failed.

I'm really surprised.  MBA with an IT designation, a degree in Pharmacology and Toxicology, Global Supply chain experience, Big Data experience - I thought that would warrant at least a follow up phone call.

Is the software filtering out suitable candidates?"
"I applied to Johnson and Johnson after working three co-ops for them.  Each co-op 4 months long.  After doing a full day interview they didnt even send me an email until a month later that I didnt get the job and they offered no explanation.  It was just a denial message from the Johnson and Johnson website.  Wasn't even from a person.

VERY BAD recruitment process."

"Be more personal with communication. I felt very suited to the role with my work with UWA at the biomedical research facility giving me insight to medical equipment required by researchers in five facilities, and my courier work with them. I was surprised not to even reach the interview stage. A generic e mail does not explain this."
Only got the standard un-successful letter.  Would be good to know why as the role I applied was a role I did with another pharma company.  Very curious why I did not even get a telephone screening interview.  
Call to discuss timeline of recruitment process.
Poor feedback when using LinkedIn or social media hiring process.... it could be better and more professional.
Communicate better
"Johnson & Johnson is very reputed organisation, may be Singapore HR is not very active in making rapport with candidates. Example is I applied for a position and never got any call or mail but I got a mail to fill the survey. Anyways , J&J is great brand across the globe , I strongly feel that this is a great organisation to work with. Looking forward for future engagement with J&J"
I felt the number of interviews was appropriate. However from a potential employee perspective I would have preferred the interviews to be of the same number but longer.  I had several questions outstanding that were not accommodated in the interview due to time constraints. Instead I had to schedule a few follow up calls during the interview process which was inconvenient for both sides I suspect.
contact ASAP if the applicant fit or does not fit any of the position applied for. 
"Offer simular paid group jobs, to future employees. 
The position,  I applied for, was already taken. They offered me another position of much less value, as a possible substitute. 

This was however not acceptable for me.

They informed my I would go into there possible prospective employment pool, and not for a swim. lol. "

Was not contacted by a recruiter
I never heard back from the recruiter or hiring manager at all. I know I am qualified for this position and yet I was not given the opportunity to interview or provided a status in why I wasn't.
communication is the most important step on any relationship even before we start any job position.

Provide a status of my application would be helpful. 
Communicate with applicants.

I recommend you hire me to value stream map your recruiting process to either improve the feedback portion ... possibly through automation, or by increasing the speed of the overall process by removing 11 forms of delays and waste.

Regarding this position, I was contacted by the hiring manager who told me that you currently had a lack of recruiters so he was taking the initiative to tell me that he really liked me, but that he hired someone from within.    "
"I believe I was a highly qualified candidate. In such cases, it would be appropriate to have a recruiter reply, so that I could have gotten more information on why they felt I wasn't a fit."

I have great interest to work in a company like Johnson & Johnson to give my best & enhance my skill set . Since there is no proper response, I have to give up.

Thanks & Regards,
Sumanth"
"I applied for the position on February 4, 2017. It is now May 16, 2017 and this is the first time Johnson & Johnson has contacted me. You need to do a better job at responding to your candidates. The position I applied for was the Senior Manager, Quality Engineering Operations. This position requires someone who is experienced and knowledgeable, and isn't a low paying position where you have many applicants to chose from. I was hired very quickly to filled a position as a Quality Engineering Manager at a company here in Florida. Your loss for not even considering my application. "
"I never received feedback. 
I am an internal candidate and I thought that would have occurred. "
Observe the above. 
"Give more reasoning as to why prospect was not chosen for interview. Also, try to contact prospect in a timely manner on employer decision to pursue prospect or not. "
"Have a recruiter contact candidates. Provide information on why candidates are not being considered for positions. I have seen reports that J&J does not hire from outside the company. If this is the case, put information in the job posting that the position will be or has been filled internally. "
let me know why you feel I am not the right candidate for your posted opening
More communication on the application results including feedback and reason of not being successful. Suggestions on alternative potions or could the potential candidate could further improve in future application with the company. indicate what is important to increase the success in the application later on.
Give applicants a chance to interview with a manager beyond the recruiter
"All application has mobile number, if a message can be sent on the status and schedule of interview that would be good, It would really help to responds much quicker, as most of us get time to check mails only during weekends. 

Also instead of in person Skype would make more easier for both parties."
"When someone applies for a position with your company, send an email that the person was not selected before you send a survey email. "
"I have a very personal point of view once in past I had to refuse a J&J offer due to family reasons. However, the whole selection process was a kind of example about how to handle candidates during all phases. For this reason and now living other personal moment that I keep trying new opportunities at J&J. For this opportunity in specific case it does not matter whether the recruiter contact me or not, once I know that the experience I had can tell me that this is not the behaviour within J&J. "
"The recruitment process for J&J did not even come close to meeting expectations relative to what I see at other companies... cumbersome process to apply, many months to fill your positions, lack of someone to contact, etc.  However, J&J is not like other companies... worth the hassle and wait.  

I recommend you hire me to value stream map your recruiting process to either improve the feedback portion ... possibly through automation, or by increasing the speed of the overall process by removing 11 forms of delays and waste.

Regarding this position, I was actually a great fit for it due to a startup I once owned, but in my excitement I failed to explain that in my cover letter, make a custom resume, etc... my fault.    "
none
"Nothing to improve, all is going well, please try to give opportunities to freshers. Thank you. 
"
Call asap the applicant or email them to know if they are qualified for the position. 
Contact applicant I heard HR dept is very slow and not able to read most of the resumes
Provide feedback to applicants on what they can do to improve their application.
Provide some human interface.
"Actually provide an interviewing opportunity..I was not even considered for an interview..Not happy at all.

Thank you"
"Follow up with candidates, specially the highly skilled. "
"Provide timely update to candidate. I tried to email and call for follow up but there is response at all. Until I received an email said I was not shortlisted for the role. This is after more than 3 months. 

I would expect better candidate experience for applicants, given J&J as a well-known MNC. "
Very good.
"I applied for several positions in August of 2016.  The recruitment process is extremely slow and 9 months is too long to be then told I didn't get the position and ask for a survey about my recruitment experience.  

I think J&J is a good company but the recruitment experience leaves a lot to be desired."
Increase communication time.
Provide more updates regardless of what the status is.
"I've never spoken to a recruiter.  I've applied for positions, and not heard anything from anyone.  I get these survey requests, but I've not been contacted by a recruiter or anyone else.  
I don't get an email or call telling me that I'm not a fit for the position or anything.  If I actually spoke to someone my score would probably change.  All this has done for me is made me stop putting in on positions at Johnson & Johnson which I know to be a good company.  "
respond to email inquiries in a timely fashion regarding status of job 
Never heard from J&J after the application confirmation.
"I was frustrated by the recruitment process because I was interviewing for this position in the Data Sciences department after I interviewed with the Statistics group.  I received an offer from the Statistics group while I was in the middle of the interview process for Data Sciences.  Instead of extending my offer reply deadline beyond 1 week and allowing me to finish my interviews with Data Sciences and make a decision between the two (if I received a 2nd offer), the interview process was abruptly stopped once I told my contact in HR that I was interviewing in another department.  This was very frustrating to me and I feel like the HR rep went behind my back when I was being honest about my situation."
"This has been a typical story for companies large and small.  Big talk about valuing process and people yet too busy to actually do so.  In an age where automation has made recruiting so much easier, it has taken companies back to the stone ages in terms of actually building a bridge to perspective applicants and caring, at least a bit.  Years ago, with stacks of paper, HR teams called people and/or actually sent mail, post cards, letters.

Speaks of class and doing things the right way.  For all the ""automated"" application buttons, a truly disappointing lack of professionalism and process...Leaders who serve?  Think not!"
Get back to candidates after the interview and give them feedback regardless of the outcome. I even contacted your company to ask for feedback after not hearing back from you for 2 weeks and still no call back. 
"I think I should be more specific about why a candidate is rejected, to improve as a candidate"
"He back to candidates about the status of their application, whether considered or not for the position.  Thank you."
"Hire me.  I am an experienced Executive Adminstrative Assistant that have supported C-level executives at J&J Corporate thru Kelly Services for 7+ years. I am knowledgeble of all the companies business units, their processes, procedures and operating systems. As importantly, I am a team player and well respected among J&J senior management.  My previous position as Senior Adminstrative Assistant for OCD's Transition Finance team was eliminated 12/31/16 with the engagement of finance processes in global countries day 1, 2 and countries. In the interim, I have applied for several positions at J&J.  Having stated all the above, I am available for hire June 2017.

I think J&J shpuldnatnpeast send an email to people appk7ed for the job on whether the peopl is suitable for it so that this people can move. Better stil so e comment to improve the candidate future applications.
Nice
Make it more human 
It would have been nice to understand why my 20 years of experience in data management within a global environment at a competing pharmaceutical company was not a fit for your company. 
"I suggest a better and open communication because there simply was none at all. The recruitment process should include the individual who is interested in the position. I was not selected and do not know why. I have seen the position open again and still haven't been considered. I even saw the position offering in a university.  
I was recommended to the position by an employee from J&J and the recruiter told that person I was called to interview,  but was not going to be selected.  I was never called for an interview.  "
I think that the interviews would be best
Better communication regarding feedback on why application was unsuccessful
Shorten the cycle will be better.
"I haven't been contacted by the recruiter yet, so can't tell"
Interview applicants   Resumes are a shallow list of a persons experience

"The interviewer Frankie McLean was very unprofessional and unprepared for the entire process. I have 15 years of Cardiology/Hospital Account experience. I had 7 letters of recommendation from key Cardiologists within the territory. I have won 8 National Sales awards and was the #1 Cardiology Hospital rep in the Nation at Novartis. I had 2 internal referrals from JNJ (Janssen) employees. One of the referrals would have been my partner (Jeff Adams). All of these factors should have been considered. Frankie chose a candidate with no Hospital Account experience and had not won a single National sales award. The candidate was subsequently turned down by the Regional Director Tim Conniff. Frankie sent another candidate and was turned down by Tim again. I do not understand how I was overlooked. I have spoke to several JNJ employees that are aware of the situation and all agreed that Frankie dropped the ball. Thanks for letting me share my experience.... Tom Luvender

"I would have loved to return to J&J, but no one ever contacted me. I since accepted a Lead Data role at another major Pharmaceutical company. 
Thank you Michelle "
An online hiring process flow/ or tracking where applicant can monitor his application status will be great. Providing updates or notice as to why an applicant is not a good fit for the position is a  cutting- edge and Johnson & Johnson hallmark as  an industry leader.
"Nothing at this time--my recruiter, Jamie, was outstanding. I am left with a favorable impression of J&J although this position was not a fit. Great company!"
Please consider candidate directly from portal.  HR is not responding. 
It took to long for answering if I was going to be eligible.
Why bother your just going to hit ITLDPs
"Did the recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to?

99% of the recruiters just send a rejection e-mail and Johnson & Johnson was no exception."
Give an active feedback about process evolution and results 
"Never contact me, when trying to open the website as j&j adviced didnt work. The position was no longer available. Then no one respond to my emails and questions.  So, I guess the only way to improve the debacle is hiring me to do the job. "
Why bother your just going to hit ITLDPs
"Completely dead and impersonal process. May sound like a negative opinion due to not getting selected, but the funny part is that I never felt that I was even being considered. Surprised to see this kind of experience with J&J. Will never apply through the online process again, for sure...wasted a lot of time."
At least contact the candidate to let them know the status of the role
I would suggest that the recruitment process should be more informative regarding the progress of candidate's application in most favorable time. 
"I have applied to so many supply chain / logistics / SAP IT related positions in JnJ within the last 1 year, but most of the applications were rejected by sending an automated rejection email by the HR system, this procedure need to be abandoned as it reduces the chances of selecting potentially skilled and experienced future employees. I strongly believe JnJ is an equal opportunity employer without considering a person's race, religion, ethnicity or age group.

"Your recruitment process was a long wait, then a standardized email telling me that you are pursuing other candidates.  I never received the first opportunity to pursue your opening, nor be seriously pursued as a qualified candidate.

"I had the qualifications for the position; didn't receive a ""thanks but no thanks"" e-mail or even a form e-mail stating that the company went with another candidate.  Bad hiring practices."
Start actually hiring from outside and not only within!

It would be very usefull for the candidate and also for J&J"
Ridiculous

The process seems very straightforward. More personalized feedback on why a candidate is selected would be helpful. 
"I receive only this survey e-mail after I sent my application to company, so it would be better if you also sent response e-mail even I have not been chosen."

"I never heard a yes or no answer on my application to this position. I would prefer to hear a definitive response in about one month, and if possible a specific reason why I am not being considered in the cased of a declined application. 

It seems valuable to obtain the attention of a recruiter, but one is at a complete loss for how to get in contact with one in the first place. The methods vary from company to company."
"Recruiters need to contact all applicants at a couple of points in the process:
1. To let them know their application/resume was received.
2. To let the candidate know what the outcome of the review is by either declining or setting up interview.

This would show a great deal of consideration and courtesy to applicants who have taken the interest and time to apply for positions at J&J. "

"I never heard from anyone at J&J, just received an email that I was not being considered for the position even though I am MORE THAN QUALIFIED.  All of these recruitment processes are a complete joke and a waste of time.  Unless you know someone at the company, it is highly unlikely that you will ever be considered.  "
Be more transparent amd communicate 
J + J needs to add a personal interview not just a phone call interview. I being in person to person interview with supervisor and directors and is more complete and you are talking with the person in charge of the area. Thanks.
I never heard from anyone. This is why my answers are not high ratings. 
I think it would be better to have a databse with all professionals interested in your enterprise and apply one or more.time because they are brand lovers and that is the.most important thing in empmoyees
Letting the candidate know what prevented them from getting the job.
It's impossible to land a job opportunity without mounting a campaign to find out who the hiring team is and getting extensive line of leadership involved to support said campaign
I have applied to several positions and never got a feedback 
Good
"I wish Johnson and Johnson would have provided me with feedback through the process. I received no concrete information throughout the process, including absolutely no closure to the process. Perhaps I am still being considered (since January 2017)?

Any actual feedback that can be provided would be greatly appreciated. I want to work for J&J but I do not know why I am not being considered a good fit. "

Let applicant know the status of apcn
It should be morally ethical to tell the prospective hires where they went wrong with their interview and why they weren't chosen other than keeping them in the loop without​ any response with hopes hanging on the thread.

I think that it would be good to receive detailed feedback related to the process.

"I have applied for so many jobs in JnJ thru the online career portal. Most of the jobs are in the supply chain / logistics / SAP / IT areas, but most of the applications were rejected by the system (99%) even before the hiring manager go thru my CV with any interest! But I heard that JnJ Singapore is entertaining recruiting agents to send their candidates for interviews; this means online application process is useless? Only the recruiting agents having direct contact with HR partners can only secure jobs with JnJ? I am wondering why my applications are rejected even though I have 16+ years of supply chain management / Logistics / SAP (all SCM modules) experience! Also with an MBA (from SUNY Buffalo), holding a Bachelor degree in Engineering and with a Citizenship status in Singapore! My suggestion is the hiring managers should show more interest and need to o thru those relevant resumes rather than the HR staff makes a shortlisting with his / her own gut feeling! The JnJ Senior Management need to look into this matter and improve the selection process. Thank you"
Provide feedback.
Ensure that you call all candidates that were previous Johnson & Johnson employees to let them know why they didn't get a chance to interview for positions to which they applied.
"First, I don't have idea how is the process of recruitment. It's good if you explain that.
Second, the recruiter should contact all the candidates and explain the reason why They are not fit the position.
And if you are in Peru, it's good idea to do all the process in Spanish.
I think  i m good for the position, and I have the question mark of the reason. It's good you do this survey. I hope my answers could help you to improve the recruitment process."
"Gives a chance for the candidate to show his competence in practice, not to base only on the theory mentioned in the vacancy."
"Be more proactive and efficient, at least go through CVs and update the applicants."
Don't treat me like I don't exist. I took time to reach out to you. Why can't you return the same courtesy vs asking me to do these surveys????
"Contact candidate and explain why was not selected or moved forward.
Especially if it is for manager os chief positions"
"As a future candidate for employment with Johnson & Johnson, I would have liked to know the reasons for dismissal. I do not like the generic, ""Thank you for your application. We have decided to pursue candidates that better fit our requirements,"" etc. It would be helpful for the prospective employee to know other jobs within the company that better fit their current qualifications. 

Thank you for taking the time to send a survey to better the recruitment process. "
Actually get in touch with candidates even if you've decided to go another direction. Even a polite form letter is better than being ignored. 
It's fine.
The recruitment process in this case was poor. I have had better experiences but I had to reach out to the recruiter to understand what was happening. The response was that this was a special case and did not flow the normal process but I was not accepted for the next stage. From this I understood that the post had been filled either prior to posting or the individual they wanted had applied.  I only had a tele interview with the recruiter even though I qualified for the post. 
You can just give us a feedback about the recruitment process before send any survey telling that we did not be selected.
It would be helpful to know why I was not selected.
Your hiring process is perhaps one of the most opaque and glacial processes that I have ever encountered.  Anything you could do would be an improvement.

"I would've appreciated an email or something letting my know I was no longer being considered. This survey was sent months, maybe even a year after I applied and has been the only communication since. I find this to be very insincere and unprofessional. "
Either have a phone interview or face to face interview with prospective candidates.

"I have been trying so hard to crack how the recruitment process work but it seems like doesn't matter how good you fit the role or how qualified and experienced you are, I guess it all depends on the internal recruitment. Love J&J as a company but truly hate the recruitment process. I hate to say this, I always believed to work in a company like this but seriously I don't have contacts or know how things work or increase my chances of getting in...so far very FRUSTRATED & DISAPPOINTED "
No communication if any kind
"For a perceived world-class company, the Recruiting process is seriously flawed.   Very little communication from the JnJ end."
Give a chance to more people.
It took 6 weeks from application to receive an email that my candidacy was going to be pursued.  Any contact at all from J&J would be better than this.
Employ me.
More feedback & a quicker response would have saved more time.
"No communication of any kind, there is a great deal of room for improvement of communication of any kind."
Never heard from anyone. 
Reach out to qualified candidates for a conversation.  The process is very impersonal.
More communication.  Did not get to discuss the position with anyone at Johnson & Johnson.
"Have received no information from a recruiter at J&J, have had no feedback, no information of any kind and I have the experience your looking for.  This has been quite frustrating, I'm not sure if I should continue to apply for opportunities. "
Communicate better and provide feedback. 
"More communication.  I did not get the chance to interview for this position.  It appears that I am not being considered for an interview, so I didn't really expect a recruiter to explain it to me."
"Communication!! I'm a very well qualified applicant with extensive experience. I've applied for 5-7 positions, some of which where in line with my career stage and others that were below. I have yet to hear from anyone from J&J. I'm no longer looking for a job, I have taken a Director level position elsewhere. "
"I had requested the agency to check on the job profile thoroughly and only recommend if that is really a good fit. The recruiter told me the exact reject reason that I had as a concern before applying for it.
It may only be the recruiter, but it may be better to list out exclusion criteria,  if there is any."
Career fair for clinical research positions where a recruiter can view your resume and make recommendations as to what you may be qualified for.
"Hr is not proactive. Lazy team, rude and arrogant attitude"
Better communication during the process would be useful. 
"Everything. It took over 4 months to find out initial outcome of my application. Truth be told, I had forgotten I'd even applied. I was sent a generic rejection email. 

""Please do not reply to this message. Replies are undeliverable and will not reach the Human Resources Department."" - J&J don't even want you to ask the department for any feedback on the application. Incredibly off-putting, especially considering the time invested by applicants to go through the J&J application process. 

Then have the cheek to send a survey with the vapid line ""Johnson & Johnson Talent Acquisition team is committed to providing a high-quality candidate experience."" Who do they think they are fooling? ""High-quality candidate experience""? Laughable.

I've applied for (and been offered) many positions and J&J has hands-down been the worst experience. The worst part is that many of my friends applied to J&J also and were treated the exact same way. It's common decency to a) Give an idea of when to expect a reply after submitting an application, b) Offer feedback if requested, or at the very least, don't outright refuse to receive emails, and c) Take less than 5 months to filter out the first batch of applicants. It seriously took 5 months for your company to filter my application out from the first round???!! 

I don't even know why I filled in this survey, but I suppose it's because of a faint hope that something will be done to improve it slightly so that future graduates might avoid being treated like dirt by this company."
"If you ask for qualifications and the person has them, at least get them an interview. You could tell the person why they were not selected to be interviewed. "
Reduce the amount of wait time during the application processes and denial or acceptance. 
Offer to train a new hire or even take a chance and hire a person that has a capable background even if it isn't a computer perfected match.  The candidate knows it but it would build a strong work ethic and brand loyalty that goes beyond employment
"Provide earlier feedback on whether candidates are being considered for a role. 2-3 weeks max. Even if J&J uses applicant trackers rather than having hiring managers or HR review resumes, at least have it send a generic message to those that don't meet the needs of the role. In one instance, I did not get a message until 2 months after I submitted a resume.

The funny thing is nearly seven years ago I had a phone interview with someone from HR and J&J and heard nothing until months later by which time I accepted a position with another company."
to get better support and follow up from recruitment team. I am former employee.
"update to all candidates, successful or not"
"at minimum, acknowledge receipt of the application and/or resume.  the only communication i received is this survey - very unprofessional!"
"I was never talked to anyone during the recruitment process. I am not sure why I am being asked about the process.  I would love the opportunity to interview, but I never got the opportunity. "
The process was very slow and after more than 6 months of waiting for an answer after the first interview I received a no. At first I was told I was moving to the second round. 
Stop age discrimination
Communication 
"Communicate, comminicate, comminicate. I'm a great IT professional and have applied to many positions without a match. I think the process is skewed to people with medical and drug experience."
"I have applied for numerous positions since leaving J&J in 2007. I had worked for 2 operating companies- Centocor and Depuy Spine and had been promoted multiple times. In addition I had served on the Credo Leadership teams for each of these OpCo's. I thought I was held in high regard and yet I have only been called once for a posiiton I applied for and that was for the recently posted AVP position for Depuy Synthes. While I recognize positions evolve... that was actually my posiiton when I left J&J in 2007 (during a restrucure). An HR representative screened me but determined I did not have the finance experience needed for this position. If I may be blunt... that rings hollow especially as I was a VP, Market Development with Fresenius after leaving J&J among other jobs which I am confident exceeded the levels of both knowledge of finance and individual accountability for this AVP position. While I remain a fan of J&J and would love to return should a strong match surface, given my experience in applying for so many positions, I can only conclude that I was not ""loved"" as much as I had thought.  

Best,

Steve"
"All-

The only thing about my experience that I appreciated was the swift reply to my application. I knew I wasn't the right fight within a couple of days. That's being more responsive than most. 

That being said, ask yourselves this: ""are we resume collectors or do we acquire talent?"" If I am not a good fit for Oncology, do you have an online tool that allows me to navigate and tell you other areas of interest? Did you really read my resume? Do you ever reach out to a candidate to inquire about possible opportunities down the road?

Food for thought.

A courtesy email and not a computer reply. If I applied is because I love that company and want to be part of of the family. I will continue looking to be part of it.

"Reach out to properly screen candidates before automatically disqualifying them. My resume was a very strong fit for the role and I was rejected in less than 24 hours. It is evident that this either the recruiter did not intend to hire anyone from the outside and already had a candidate identified, or didn't even take the time to properly peruse the resume. "

Phone call
Absolutely crap...No one contacted till date...Please stop sending this stupid email which you are not capable off...
"I was surprised that no phone call was made. I am obviously a recruiter and i do not judge a potential candidate by a resume. If someone makes the effort to submit an application a quick call to find out why they feel they would be suitable for the role only takes a few minutes. Surely candidates deserve a call rather than an instant rejection email. (within 30 minutes of my application to be exact).
I work in IT, some roles i advertise i get over 60 odd applications and yet it is still common courtesy to call the candidate and see what it is that they are after.
We are not in the game of bums on seats, Talent Acquisition / Recruitment is all about changing lives, finding the best opportunity for the candidate whether its an internal role or not."
The interview was  by conference. I think that with an interview in person you can have a better understanding and connection with the candidate
You can follow up with your applicants
Please hire me. Please. I want to work with your company so very badly. It's been my goal since 2010.
"I got a response that this particular job was taken down due to lack of resources or some financial reason.  That is odd.  Not sure if you were trying to let me down easy or something.  Most rejections say that they have found someone better suited to the job.  In my case, as I am 63, and that means they found someone younger.  All I can ask is that you and other companies with the power to hire or reject consider the older candidate equally.  That's the law, I think.

"End canned responses from automated software, and have human resources run by, humans!  Be able to give meaningful feedback that is specific, not simply ""we were looking for someone with a bit more experience"" or ""with a different background"" because those are brush off responses.  Personalize the rejection; when all I received was an email addressed ""Sir or Madam"", it in painfully obvious there was zero effort put forth to see how my background and skills would allow my to be successful in the role. This is further reinforced when the auto-response says ""after careful consideration""; this is akin to the person, who is compelled to tell you they will repay you if you lend them money. They will not repay you, and no consideration was given.  Now I just need to find out who uses j&j for their private label products so I can try to avoid purchasing those too."
I have not received anything on the job I applied for. I have been in Senior leadership for years and would have great conversation with my recruiters for the lack of attention to the opportunities for candidates.
"Be more personable with the applicants. There is never a real explanation why I have never gotten an interview for the many,many times I have applied to various jobs."

"Someone dropped the ball somewhere.  I had a single telephone interview with a hiring manager.  After the interview, the hiring manager stated he was interested in me and desribed the upcoming process steps.  However, he stated he was going away for a couple of weeks and that someone would contact me then regarding the first interview.  Well, I heard nothing further, ever, until this survey."
Not sure what you guys want . No one reached me from the recruitment team and after a long time looks like some system generated email that you are not selected and now you guys are looking for feedback... not sure if I didn't went through the process at all how I'm applicable for the Survey... again this survey also not capturing much details... so looks like total process need to be reviewed... else this is something bad for such great organization.
Take the time to speak to candidates whose resumes are completely relevant for open positions before simply screening them out.
Improve the candidates short list selection process.
I wasn't aware that I wasn't the right fit and I am not sure as to why not. I am becoming more and more disillusioned by the J&J employment process. There is almost no contact  and the follow-up is none existent - even those remote times when a recruiter reaches out AND promises follow-up (even in the event of bad news). You can do (and have done) better.
Contact a candidate to let him know what's going on with his application before   sending a survey about how well you're doing things!!
I have applied for several jobs and have never once had contact with any recruiter. It would be very helpful to make the recruitment process more personalized and less automated.

"For the attached position 2407160406.  I had to go back into my email to see when i applied.  It was April of 2016.  The only thing i can suggest is that the recruiter keeps the candidate in the loop and keep reminders to send out the not selected email to the applicants and candidates.  Also, perhaps sending the survey within 90 days after the posting is closed would get a higher survey result."
"I have received a email about another job, saying that I did not get it. But that is all I have received. It would be nice if places would take a chance on someone that might not have a BA. I have many years in the hospital setting (Cath Lab) and would be a great fix clinical job.

" Not being selected as a candidate is certainly an option every applicant needs to be prepared for, however, receiving some feedback reg. the decision and recommendations for future application would be extremely helpful. This would make the application and selection process definitely a collaborate effort. As in most companies, I would expect that collaboration is highly valued at Johnson&Johnson."

A simple phone interview with one manager at ASP so disgusted me I'm not sure if I'll ever apply to J&J again.  You need to get somebody down there with a clue and clean the place up.

"Not sending an email notifying applicants that they've not been chosen says a lot about how the company does or does not value both clear communication and/or potential employee labor. It takes the applicant significantly more time to tailor information and fill out the company-specific online HR form (which includes a specific field for email, so that data should be easy to aggregate) than it does to send a form email to rejected applicants. No notification makes the company look like they view the work relationship as usurious and labor-squeezing from the get-go.

One of the way the company can improve the recruitment process is to acknowledge the other applicants by giving then an interview.

"It would be of great help if the HR team would inform the candidates if their profile has been rejected. According to me this is basic HR ethics. Further these are the small steps that really helps in not only building an ethical work climate within the organisation but also communicates to various stakeholders about the organisation's values.
If not through email the status of the application can be updated on the profile of the candidate. 
Further this questioner can be desired in a better way, as there was a question which was not applicable in my case but did not have that option.
Further people should be treated as people who have varied experiences and can bring in innovation and diversity rather than just a the 'required work experience'. Anyway in my case, even when I had the required experience and skill set as mentioned in the job description (in my opinion)  in research, I still do not know why my profile was not even shortlisted for primarily round of interview/s.
Johnson and Johnson came across as an organisation which is laid back and does not really bother about people who they don't seem can be useful at that particular moment.

Your process is no different than that of any other company.  Post a job.  Solicit resumes.  Respond with a generic reply.
More feedback would really and a more professional approach would improve the recruitment process.  
I would appreciate the opportunity to speak with someone live to explain my fit for the position. 
Get in contact and keep the involed individual informed.
Consideration
Have someone contact you.  I'm not sure why I didn't qualify. 
I appreciate being kept up to date.  It seems as though not being currently employed by your company is a hindrance. I have a lot to bring to your company. 
I have had no reply from J&J of my application
I am desperate i need a job
"send resume to hiring manager
improve your filters
educate your HR staff to think outside the box when looking for people"
Using skype 
The application should be rejected with a reason which doesn't happen in my case.
As a prior jnj employee I believe jnj is a great company.  However tying to get back in and going through the application process seemed slower and cumbersome 
send our resume to the hiring manager because you are filtering out too many good candidates
Need to know the reason for rejecting as a feed back not for hr point of view it helps the applicants to improve . 
"Consider for the position candidates from other localities of the Country, because if you intend to change city and state, you are determined to do a great job."
call us
"More feed back about positions from recruiters i.e. found another candidate, etc"
I would like to have known what specifically disqualified me from the pool of applicants. 
Give alert after reviewing resume.
Recognizing recent graduates as valuable assets and not consistently overlook their capabilities. 
"Geri bildirimleri daha hızlı ve daha açıklayıcı olabilir. Ayrıca tecrübeli kişileri keşfetmek ve tanımak için ilk mülakata davet edebilirsiniz. Çünkü insanlardaki cevheri gözlerine bakarak yüz yüze konuşarak daha iyi ve doğru keşfedebilirsiniz !!! Tabi bu benim nacizane fikrim. Bilgilerinize.
Saygılarımla.
"
"Hi,
please stop to send some reply every time ""copy and paste"".
Every candidate deserved better than an automatic reply.
 I spend a lot of time to fill my candidature........then 24 hours same reply "" after few evaluations we decide to proceed with a different candidate......we encourage to continuing in apply.....

"Not sure I am completely familiar with the whole process. Only once in the last 22 years since 1995, did I ever get a call to fill out questions regarding a Vice president for molecular diagnostics position some time in 2004. Hopefully my suggestions will be better once I make progress with many of the applications I have on file with JNJ."
Become more proactive
"Johnson & Johnson's recruitment process is terrible. J&J's recruitments process and recruiters have consistently and systematically discriminated against me. The process is very unfair, flawed and lacks any transparency. J&J apparently seems to tolerate a culture of rampant employment discrimination in their recruiting process."
I applied for a role and was sent an automated email telling me that I hadn't been selected for interview. No feedback what so ever. No reasons. Didn't get a chance to elaborate on my CV by even speaking to a recruiter as an initial step.
More growth opportunities for those already in j&j.

A direct contact from the recruiter providing feedback to the candidates.
"Eliminate bias of age, gender and automatic computer disqualification from any white collar employment because I have a conviction of a felony 10 years ago.  A felony conviction must not be a life sentence of unemployment when I am the most qualified individual for the position yet I was never even interviewed."
I don't know if it can. Entry level positions have dozens of applications. I imagine it is not cost effective to express exactly why individual candidates were not selected.
"Since you didn't tell me the recruitment process, I can't tell you anything."
Provide feedback to candidates.
I applied for this job a long time ago and never got any feedback. 
I would like to know the reason why I was not selected. I suppose it is my age. I don t know.
"I continue to apply for jobs at JnJ. I NEVER get ANY feedback except these surveys emails. I find out that I am not being considered for the positions I apply for from these surveys... That is NOT right. You need to fix this. I know you reorg'd your HR/TA process in the last 6 months. JnJ's previous model was excellent and I was always impressed. With this new process, you did not fix something that wasn't broken, you have successfully BROKEN something that was working great."
I thought the interview went fairly well but he told me he would call and he never did and after a week I received a standard letter thanking me for interviewing when I wanted to ask him what I could do to get a sales job since I've been out of the industry for over 10 years.
"Respond or communicate with canidites in a timely manner. I believe I got an email approximately 7-8mo after I initially applied for the position. I even went by the facility and was basically told good luck as it takes forever to hear anything, if anything back. After that experience I stopped even considering Johnson & Johnson as a company I would want to work for. "
Contact  with  a  human being  would  be  helpful. It is  highly  possible  that  if someone  had  actually  spoken  to  me you  might  have  found  that  I  could  be a  good  fit  for  the  role. 
"There was no, and I mean absolutely no, communication from the recruiter regarding my application after initial interview.  I was verbally informed I was a highly regarded candidate due to experience and I would be recommended for second round interview.  From this point there was no communication from J&J, excluding my email queries for information.  Here is a C&P of my last communicate FYI;

Hi Nikkie,

I hope you are well.  As the festive season is upon us and most industry moves into a shut down period for the Christmas and New year break I just wanted to make a quick query of any updates or information you may have in the recruitment process for the hip product manager position at de Puy in Australia.

I would assume the process will move into interview stage early in the new year, I wanted to be sure to be available as I will be heading coastal for just over a week with family

Wishing you a safe and happy festive season

I would advise to improve the feedback provided for applicants.
"Johnson & Johnson's recruitment process is terrible. J&J's recruitments process and recruiters have consistently and systematically discriminated against me. The process is very unfair, flawed and lacks any transparency. J&J apparently seems to tolerate a culture of rampant employment discrimination in their recruiting process."
Provide feedback 
"Do recruitment process ofline like psikotest, inteeview hrd, mcu , ect"
"Submitted my resume, but was not contacted by anybody from HR.  Received a generic email within a week.  Very impersonal. Never mentioned the position, my credentials, nothing.  Would NEVER apply to J&J again for any job!!"

"Getting a chance to hearing feedback would be nice but I understand that due to the high volume of applications received, that is difficult. Nonetheless, I think it is important that J&J should provide feedback to ones who really seemed passionate about getting a job at J&J."
"I have applied for more than 20 jobs till date in the last 3 months. I have not received any response or was contacted by the staffing team. I find it really hard to believe that I with almost 20 years of IT experience and many certifications could not be good fit for any of roles. It's disappointing as I hold the company is high regards for it's culture and it's contribution to the society. I sincerely that the company takes notice of my talents and skills and I could be a valuable contributor to it's further successes.

"Talent Acquisition Team should get back to applicants in a more timely fashion.
Applicants spend time applying for positions with J&J and the ATS sends back an automated response telling you that you were disqualified. Survey should be revised. Do not understand why I received request to participate when I was disqualified for the role and never had an opportunity to talk to Recruiting Manager or Hiring Manager or any other person live."
"I was referred by two employees and not even a letter that personalized my application process.  Extremely unhappy with the response without even speaking with me.  I KNOW I have the qualifications and skills for the position.  The only way to gauge whether I fit into the organization is to reach out to candidates like me and speak with them, especially those in HR.  The only story I tell myself, was it my age?

"J&J career page did not mention that video interview was first step in the hiring process and career web page needs to be updated to mention this important piece of information.  My PC does not have camera (I do not Skye) and there was no alternative way for me to record my video interview.  Please provide a  phone interview as alternative to video interview because not every person has the latest electronic equipment. I'm very surprise that J&J would not have a alternative way for people to be interview if they did not have cameras and seems that J&J does not care (because there must a lot of people applying for positions and this is one way of ""weeding out"" job applicants).  My is name: Ed Clark-732-247-1023 call me if you have any questions. "
Provide additional status during the recuitment process.
It would be nice to receive feedback

Followup communication is slow.  Learning the process is over can take months."

I myself have applied for the positions at JnJ and having contributed 3 years of my life working on various projects for JnJ.

"They can begin by treating all candidates with respect.  I'd suggest treating candidates who were former J&J employees (10+ years) with maybe even a bit for respect.  I received NO feedback from the recruiter at all. The hiring manager was sent 4 recommendations from current J&J employees, so at the VP level and didn't even reply or get back to them.  These employees were sent a strong message that the position was filled before it was ever posted. The new hire who filled the role is a qualified individual (I know them personally) - especially since I trained them... so what it comes down to is you have leadership who is too afraid to hire candidates that might be uncomfortable for them to manage, because they're in a role that is over their head.  
Used to love J&J.. would tell anyone who would listen how great a company it is, about the CREDO, the people, the mission... not any more.  "

Person to person contact would be great. The automated responses are seriously delayed and are not personable.

"As I know the position has tremendous applicants and you screened who and which can go to the next round. I believe applicants like myself with no Oncology background has no chance to see the light. Talents and success of every person is inherent where he or she can be successful to any given task if the chance is on his/her hand. I'm sure you will agree that not all candidates with Oncology background won't succeed  with the position since they were not born with the skills. There are different levels of athletes and performers. The best of the best super siege adversity and find ways to succeed but those good once was left behind because they had no background. Only then we realize that this position is just a vicious cycle. They come and go among the candidates that was hired. It's the reality because the people who are really  dying to have the job was not given a chance. It's the system we live in where I wish we had a fighting chance to prove it. Anyways, this is just a comment and food for thoughts I don't expect to see the other side of the coin. We draw a line and since then we kept the same line of resistance. Some far days when look back what we have done we see all of these as purely just business."
Recruitment process is very slow and the application process is very tedious and not at all user friendly 
"As I applied directly via system (not via a search firm) I did not have enough information about the postion and about the recruting process at all. 
So I have asked a couple of questions after receiving an interview invitation regarding the process to the recruiter throuth email but she never replied even if I sent her reminders several times. She did not even pick up my phone call and finally after I called the reception I could get an answer from her. and she was very abrupt all the time. (the interviewer was very nice)
As a person who does HR as well, I was deaply disappointed at your process and how you treat your candidates. I did not want to work at a place that HR is not professional at all."
"Frankly I recognize that you get many applications to your many open jobs and thus what I did at least appreciate about J&J was that they at least had a closed looped system, meaning you were informed of receipt and being reviewed and then a final note that your candidacy was not a fit. Not much detail other than that but I can tell you that already that is better than 90% of most companies where it feels like a black hole. Hope this is helpful. I'm still very interested in finding my next career at J&J. "

Recruiters could at least contact me with their feedback especially since I was a referral. Thank you. 
Please send a position.
I'm not sure if your external recruiting process is just an exercise to check the box or if you all already have an internal candidate in mind and its just a forgone conclusion.
"I was not setup for a phone interview as I had expected. And only received email telling me I was not a fit. Usually recruiters will not set you for a position unless there is a high probability you will at least get a phone interview. Without any specific feedback, I am unsure how to improve my resume for any future positions."
"I deeply respect the brand, its corporate initiatives, and marketing capabilities.  

My responses in this survey were based on J&J's recruitment process and past related communications only.  

The result was a disappointment of course since with this particular global media role, it is still difficult to imagine how one, -based on the information provided on website with supporting documents - could have been better qualified than myself.  

With that said, a brief explanation for the decision may have been helpful in better understanding J&J's priorities, and also in case the decision was due to certain technicalities that I could have easily corrected on paper or on its career website.  Thank you. "
Put more effort in the communications.
Contact applicants. I have no clue why I wasn't selected nor even called for an interview. 
I am interested in the Head of HR position at Johnson and Johnson.  I was initially contacted by one of the recruiters at J&J and encouraged to apply.  I did but never heard back until getting a rejection notice via email.  I do see the opportunity is available again.  I believe my background to be a close match.

Curiously I never received a call from the recruiter. I don't apply to many positions and currently employed by Sanofi. However; this position seemed like a perfect fit and I met all of the qualifications. Was really surprised I never contacted.
"HR needs to open up its narrow view of candidates. Looking for the exact experience for a position limits new ideas. Business school teaches that if you are a good manager you should be able to move to any industry and excel. I believe the HR folks did not learn this valuable lesson. I do not mean to pick on J&J, this thought is prevalent throughout the country.
If HR did this then it may ta
ke a little more work on their part to screen candidates however I believe you would get a much better and productive employee.

Find out exactly where the area of the job is. The interviewer didn't know the territory for the job. I live on the Gold Coast and she didn't know how far down to the coast the area was. As she didn't know I didn't want to commit myself. I am extremely qualified in the field the position needed. But it was off putting when I didn't know where the area of work was. 
I think thie was a mistake - I didn't get called for an interview at all.  I unfortunately  haven't received any feedback from J&J regarding the positions I had applied to.
"There is no doubt that Johnson & Johnson is one of the best pharma company. However for all the jobs I have applied till now, I have got the same response from J&J saying they have found someone who is more qualified.

Despite meeting most of the requirements listed under the job openings, I have never got a call for the interview."

"This position was posted for a J&J company speculated to be up for sale. I went on site for the interview to see the process through, but the hiring manager left before meeting me - I only met with other members of the team. I did not receive feedback or a request to complete the interview with the hiring manager. I reached out to the recruiter a few weeks later, and was told that the position status was uncertain. Never heard back after that point. I certainly understand that hiring needs change, but this was not communicated clearly to me as a candidate. If a posting is available, it should be certain enough for interviewers to take seriously. "

"In a dynamically evolving business environment, J&J is backward looking in sourcing and hiring talent, much like most firms. Rather than look forward and hire talent for a position with evolving responsibilities, most companies seek to clone the incumbent who last held this position. In essence, most companies seek the status quo and are not forward looking. Unconventional work experience that meets the necessary qualifications and adds a dimension of diversity of experience is frowned upon in favor for someone who held same exact job in same exact type company and had same exact career progression as last person who held the position."
The recruiter should have the decency to email the interviewee back when the interviewee emails them and ask for feedback on why they didn't get the position. One of the interviewer came off very unwelcoming during the interview.

"Since any application process is tedious by nature, I would recommend to any employer that they avoid requiring the candidate to re-type information that is already contained in a resume.  Recognizing that larger employers receiving a high volume of applicants, such as J&J, need a consistent format of candidate data in order to expedite reviews, it would be courteous in those instances for the employers to identify disqualifying features from the outset (e.g., lack of specific licenses, experiences, etc.). That would spare unnecessarily lost time and effort on the part of both employer and candidate. Remember, many of the applicants are managing full time jobs so completing an application process occurs (or should occur) during non-work hours. For those wishing to provide thoughtful responses this is a time-consuming process.  Letting candidates know of non-negotiable, baseline hiring requirements would be extremely helpful and appreciated. Thanks for opportunity to submit feedback. "

I could hear from you as much from you all on my status instead of every time getting this survey as the only communication.
They never get back to you. Not even with with the reject letter. Instead they send you multiple survey emails. Which is of no use!

Rather than sending multiple survey emails and pissing off the candidates. 
I heard nothing back from Johnson&Johnson from my application so my suggestion would be to be more communicative with prospective employees.
"work with incumbent directly, not focusing on resume only"
"Be clear at the beginning of the process how many interviews are involved, and what the selection timeline would be. State whether there is an internal candidate being considered as well. It seemed that requests for previous work samples were collected as templates to use internally.

Johnson & Johnson have a excellent recruitment process. I thing that's not have to improve anything in the process.
I was never contacted regarding any interview for this position. In fact I have made several applications with no interview despite my extensive experience.

Once the rejection was received, there was NO feedback provided as to why was rejected even though I felt I matched the job description requirements."
"I can't think of anything.  It is typical to not hear back from companies.  

I believe I eventually received a form letter (I am assuming after the position was actually filled).  This is better than many companies who never contact you back at all.  It would be great to hear the real reason why you weren't selected after an interview but I realize there are potential legal implications.  I will continue to apply where I see a mutual fit.  I understand you receive an extremely large volume of resumes from some very qualified candidates, so I think you are doing well under those circumstances.

This was very weird because at no point did we ever get to discuss any offer/relocation requests in our conversation.  Not only did the local HR rep misconstrue what we had discussed but also proceeded to negate me as a candidate because she did not want to do any basic level work to coordinate logistics to get to an onsite interview.

Actually look at the resume and application and call.  I am extremely qualified.  You are not alone.  Rarely does an online application lead to any kind of interview.  I would suggest not posting if internal candidates are prioritized and or actually having a report that shows what % of sales jobs or sales leadership jobs are filled by outside candidates.

2. Website to apply most painful, you cannot rest password. you get the email with temporary password but it does not work. Really this is basic IT...
3. I never heard from recruiter, but immediately after applying you get a request for survey to complete on recruitment process, really....
4. There are a lot of jobs open from several months some going back to 6 - 8 months, it either tells me your process is not working or these are not real job openings
5. Overall very disappointed with J&J recruiting - Great company and products but not efficient in managing recruiting process."
A recruiter was not part of the process of application for me so I am not sure how this survey affects me or how a recruiter could have augmented the process for me. 
Follow up with candidates especially the internal ones. I did not receive any updates not even an explanation why I was not a good fit although the requirements for the job do fit my skills and experience.
"As my experience example, I expected to get feedback from recruitment, but did not heard from any. 

I think a brief email may be better to update the status for the applicant.

It will be great if J&J could provide update for the recruiting process at least monthly. It's hard to followup with the recruiter and HM after the onsite interview and I did not get any feedback since the interview (over one month ago).

"I have learned that J&J has 2 different websites to search for open positions. One is this one: http://www.careers.jnj.com/.  The other one is here: https://jnjc.taleo.net/careersection/2/moresearch.ftl.

The search and filter capabilities on the first website are woefully inadequate - inaccurate and difficult to navigate.  The search and filter capabilities on the second website are must easier to use.

Taleo is a very poor ATS. I have seen it consistently distort and corrupt my resume upon import. I can only imagine that I have lost out on many jobs where I am a perfect match because Taleo has ruined my chances of being found through searching. 

I am also a bit surprised at this survey, as I was never contacted by any recruiter - I only received the automated ""To confirm, we have received your submission for the position of Director, PMO Strategy & Innovation (7863161027) at Janssen Research & Development, LLC"" email message. I received no other communication from J&J related to this position.  I only realized I was no longer a candidate when the position was no longer posted on the Career website."
"During the online application process, there is no final review step prior to submission, which would be helpful for candidates."
I got the fastest rejection letter in my professional career. I applied at midnight to discover at 7am next day that I am not a good candidate without any further clarification. I got a much better offer from Genentech who showed respect and dignity. 
"First of all thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback. It would help if you provide  more detail about why I did not fit the profile for the position. But I do thank you for the feedback email about that I was not consider for the Position, that let me concentrate in other open spots.   Thanks Again. "
I consider myself strong with 17 years of manufacturing experience with a get the job done attitude and have initiated various improvement (CIP) projects. My resume speaks of it. Not to get a call or even an email response is disappointing. Even smaller corps are responding effectively. Larger organization like JJ it is normal  to have internal politics but would like to see atleast it is kept away from recruiting process. 
"My resume was a perfect fit for the role. I am in the industry already, so I would know this. CFA, FRM, multiple products, PM Experience. I imagine an HR or Recruiter screened me out of the eligible candidates before it got to the hiring manager, because I was missing a specific word or title that means the same as other titles on my resume. My company often does the same thing, so I would recommend passing to the hiring manager or hiring talent acquisition persons familiar with the industry in the future."
"1) by giving a feedback in reasonable timeframe (not several months)

2) by giving the possibilty to apply online in several times (so that the candidate can start the process, save his application even if not 100% fulfilled, and resume and complete it in a 2nd time)"
"Explain why the hiring manager ""decided to go in another direction."""
communicate with applicants.  There has been 0 communication from HR regarding this or ANY of the postings that I have applied for over the past 9 months.
As same J&J provide a feedback about application. It's very important to send a feedback for a candidate positive or negative. I don't receive any feedback about this process.
"I never heard anything back from your company until today, 136 days after I applied.  I can't even understand how you could send a survey to me after that long, but never contact me about the position at all.   I had heard that J&J was a great place to work, but if this is representative performance, I'd say I may have ""dodged a bullet"" here.  But this is one voice crying in the wilderness.  I'd love to hear from someone in your HR function telling me why  my experience is not representative of J&J's norm.  So, what can you do to improve the process?
• Respond to candidates.
• In a timely manner.
• Regardless of the decision about the candidate (to continue or decline them)"
"From an internal job search perspective, it would be ideal to have the capability of searching for a role of interest by more than just a job title (e.g. specific skill, years of experience, and/or education). 

From a recruitment perspective, I think our Leaders have an opportunity to help guide ALL personnel towards a role or job of choice.  We place a great amount of responsibility on the Employee, yet we loosen the responsibility on those who have the means of truly developing and fostering others.  

Lastly, visibility to ALL open roles within J&J should be available to the Employee population, at minimum.  Yammer is frequently leveraged for so many way to communicate to the broader audience.  Perhaps it can be used to support the focus on development, retention, organizational movement, and equal opportunity."

"A phone interview would be nice for a qualifying applicant, instead the HR department just instantly rejected via email. "

"Responding to candidates when they are not selected in a timely manner is a plus. How can we rate you effectively when weeks have passed. The recruitment process can be long and arduous for some companies, however, handling the process better should be Johnson & johnson's priorty."
To contact candidate in every stage of the process
"Send me jobs that are more aligned with my background and experience, and Invite me in for a one on one. I'd appreciate it. Thank You"
Very unprofessional hiring process. I did not hear anything about the process. Very disappointing recruiting team.
communicate.................
I would love feedback on why I was not chosen.
Um contato do recrutador.
"    I first applied about 1-2 months ago with no response. I reached out to a J&J contact on Linked-In who could ONLY help me if I had the job#. I could not locate it at the time and disregarded this survey then because of the frustrating experience.
    I have more recently re-applied and still heard nothing. I can't rate a recruitment process that hasn't happened."
Since this survey seems to be the chosen form of notice perhaps it should state rather than merely imply that the candidate was not selected.
Communication. We are all just people after all and deserve to be treated equally and with respect. 
Pay close attention to mycredentials. I've seen lesser competent people being hired by JJ. Not a fair process. You're neglecting very highly qualified people based on? Whatever!!!
"Never make contact with me, I don't know the reason that why don't accept my profile "
Respond to qualified candidates providing insight to the selection process 
Hire Me!
"Recruitment on line are something new, but requires more precise responses and feedback to the candidate in a way that contributes to both"
No update nor any confirmation nor even response to as to if the position has been filled up and so forth. I wish I had the option of withdrawing my application if I knew the recruiting process was this unprofessional. Will not advice nor apply to any of the positions from this company ever again in the future.
"Hire better recruiters who value experience in the market, military experience that translates to success here and does not judge candidates prior to having a discussion with them over the phone at least. I am done considering any J&J oppprtunity as I have yet to hear good things lately. "
actually have contact with applicants...................................
Why don't you have me come in for a one on one and we can see where I am a good fit within the company.
I was never contacted about the position at all. Did not receive any communication in any format at all. 
"Other than hire me, I would like better and possibly more human follow up. The letters that I may not be considered for a role are often very cold and impersonal however the fact that you are offering this survey shows that you care for your potential and future employees."
"None.  I think if you have family that works there you understand that it is hard to get it, but great potential if you do achieve employment "
Giving a better feedback on the recruitment process and expanding the selection process to have more knowledge of candidates with more information on each candidate. A virtual interview.
"I would suggest Johnson & Johnson take a more personal approach; and reach out to candidates that meet over 90% of the job postings criteria to say why they were or were not chosen to proceed through the hiring process.

Any type of feedback from HR to strong candidates will help build a better J&J company."
To give a feedback 
Feedback on the application is highly appreciated. 
"Some times some prospective seems to be more professional at the interview time rather than the resume itself as you seen so I wish if the recruitment department take a serious issue about that I know by my skills that I have, if I meet some employers I will inspire them about what they need to know about the business."
"Actually contact the person, ask questions about the knowledge."
I only receive an e-mail fro J&J indicating I was not a match. I sadly can not answer many of the questions
It is good that an applicant receives feedback on whether they made the 1st cut or not. But it's not enough...maybe let them know why?
Never spoke to a human
Didnt get a clear mail about how my profile did not matched the requested job post
"I never recieved contact for an interview... How can I rate it but in a non positive way ... My qualifications are strong yet I'm overlooked..
Thank you and have an awesome great day
 "
"To tell you guys the truth, I didn't even know I was not selected for this position as well as what was the reason why I was not a good fit for the position I've applied to, I've been applying for IT Division since September 2016 and I can tell you guys I always got really useful feedback from all recruiters telling me why I was not a good fit for their positions. It helps me put that feedback into action to become a better candidate.

My interview with HR team member was about 5 minutes by phone, nobody from IT Division even talked to me, in my opinion, not only is it unjust and undignified, but it causes problems to get a new opportunity in the future.

My colleague Clovis Inacio Pereira - GTSBR (cperei50@ITS.JNJ.com) knows all my work experience in technology very well that's the reason he has referred me on 2 different occasions at J&J, he shares the same thoughts about all this situation.

Patricia Armentano that is a member of my family and works for J&J São Paulo shares the same thoughts as well."
I received no feedback about my application.
"You send me jobs that fit my background and experience. why don't you have a person look at my resume instead of my resume being rejected by a computer program. I one time worked for one of the family of companies, and what bothers me is that I can not find a job in any of the other family of companies in my area.
Please have someone from HR contact me. Thank You"
"the process time, the feedback, quantity of candidates, hiring day, etc. etc.."
Provide feedback when candidate submits resume. And provide feed back if the resume is not selected. 
I would like to get more feedback from recruiters. 
Let people know what is going on.  I applied for this position and out of the blue (a month later or so) I get an email that I was not wanted for the role.  Overall terrible experience and no communication to applicants which is not fair to them trying to figure out their job situation.
Current recruitment process is good.
To give us personal feedback (phone call is more than enough for that) regarding ours application refusals.
The Recruitment team difunto even contacted me. What si the purpose of having candidates fill out forms if the recruitment team does not contact the candidates. It seems pointless filling out forms. Looks like all processes are filled with people that the recruitment team already know rather than really review every form. 
I don't get any feedback from J&J for more than 3 months after a position application. You should give any initial decision within 2-4 weeks.
I was not contacted by the recruiter
say me what the reason for not fit in this position.
Sending recruiter email as soon as possible if submission is rejected. 
The position I applied for was cancelled so I have no review on this.
"I would not say I went through any recruitment process. I applied for the role, it very shortly after that disappeared from the website and I never heard another thing for about 6 months when I got a standardised  email confirming I was unsuccessful. I know J&J value their talent from working there but this definitely was not reflected in this experience "
"Communicate with the applicant on the interview process/next steps.  
We are promoting healthy careers in J&J and it is not acceptable for a candidate to interview for a position and then see the JJEDS update with a person in the role."
An update should help! 
what process. Did everything on line. never was contacted by a recruiter.
"I was never contacted about any role with JnJ. The last I heard months ago was that the role was put on hold by an automated email. I guess the role was cancelled or filled, I have no idea because I was never contacted. This did not leave a good impression of JnJ with me and I will not recommend anyone to a role here."
Feedback would have been nice.  
Give a feedback at the end of the process.
Hire me!
"There is no doubt J&J is a dream career for a lot people like me and they receive tons of applications for one position. I have 4.00 GPA, preparing for CPA license, completed an Tax Internship with PricewaterhouseCoopers, have other Tax experiences as well but I didn't even get a phone interview! I believe some campus recruiters have very strong feelings only for certain schools, which isn't a fair way to determine an applicant's qualities of future work. Anyway, I wish J&J best of luck. T"
You should hire me. I work with several of your reps increasing their access and market share. 
"I was told by an independent recruiter that J&J was interested, I applied, apparently no interest.  Communication is key here, people deserve to know one way or another where they stand.  Total waste of time
"
Hire me!  :-)
I never was contacted by your recruiter or have any interview after apply.
Provide feedback as to why a candidate was not selected and know if they would be a good fit for another open position.
I received an email stating my resume had been reviewed and that I would being considered as a potential candidate for the position. Not even two minute later I received an email stating I was no longer being viewed as a candidate for the same position. I just found the situation annoying and unorganized. I'm not sure what changed in those two minutes but it was disappointed. 
"Interview and hire people with amazing talent and skills and don't expect a history in pharmaceutical sales only.  I believe you are passing on a lot of incredible candidates that with a litttle company training can become stars for J&J.  That's all, many blessings."
Call me for an interview 
"You should contact everyone who gives you the time to complete an application form for  a job and give them a reason why they have been turned down for the position to enable them to change the way they go about trying to get employment for the future. Also this gives you the chance to reaccess the candidate on the chance you are letting a good future employee slip through the system. There probably many genuine applications that don't get through the process that are a lot better than the ones that do. E.g. myself who is fed up of travelling to Dublin every week for work and wants to work in Limerick to be with his wife and two children who will give 100% commitment  to the job I send an application too. 
Thanks for your time. 
Regards 
James Shippam."
"There was no human contact, just the standard rejection templated email."
Provide some communication either way if selected or not. I was an internal referral and never heard a word after I applied. I am assuming the position I applied for months ago has been filled. It is nice to hear thank you so much for applying but we went a different route. 
Please tell me if I'm no longer being considered for a role after I take the trouble to come in and interview.
creo que por lo menos nos deben dar una razón o una oportunidad de conversar y saber porque no somos adecuados para el puesto!
"I think that they should not only selecting people by their quality at dynamic group, because sometimes it does not qualify the professional. I was eliminate from the trainee selection because I didn't have a good performance in the dynamic group, however it was not totally my fault, once that my group dind't listen my opnions, then my group presented a really bad project. I think that would be a good idea, they only eliminate a candidate, only after after interviews.
Thanks for the opportunity, I would be really happy to have another opportunity to try join Johnson & Johnson Team."
"Dar um feed back, mais completo..."
"J&J is a great company with fantastic reputation in the industry. As a result, the interview process should be more candidate friendly (such as timely feedback) to reflect the same high standards. 

Yours truly. "
I believe Johnson & Johnson would improve the recruiting process by giving feedback on the points that were not favorable to hiring the candidate.
Communicate about the roles
I was never contacted by the recruitment team other than a automated response. Thought that I would get at least a call given I used to work for JnJ and was referred to the position. 
A little better information.  
"Greater selection of entry level, early career opportunities for prospective employees with 1-3 years experience looking to begin a long term career with the company. "
"contact me in the future
thanks"
I wasn't  offered a phone interview or an feedback just an email letting me know you received my resume.  And now this survey.  
"Punctual, professional, kind. "
"Take the time to contact interested applicants, especially at higher levels.  There is a growing problem in recruiting with a lack of communication and an over reliance on bots to review resumes.  I am a media director.  Those two words are keywords enough to warrant a phone call about a  media operations position."
I recall receiving that my application was received and being processed but not a result of consideration - That is I do not know if I am still being considered or not?
"Became more human
 And not technologically advanced."
"Nowdays I think that the hiring process are old and highly oriented to hire people with technnical skills. This is important but I believe you must to include social skills as well. On the other hand, companies like Johnson & Johnson are to formal in their recruitment process which  seems  people are applying in the best job in their lives but is not. "
"Based on your survey, I am suggesting a more personal response to applicants.  That may not be possible, though.

Take care,

Michael"
"Automated Tracking Systems (ATS) seem to be a growing trend to automate talent recruiting initiatives.   Perhaps a less generic way to approach qualified individuals when either no response is heard after the initial acknowledgement of the job submission maybe a nice touch.  However, this is not inconsistent with all large firms that are recruiting in the present market.

Thanks for asking me to complete the survey.  I don't mind taking the time out to do so.   "
Clarify if this survey and email indicate being dispositioned from the application process. 
Communicate with a sense of urgency. 
Should give the opportunity to people who have the experience and have already worked the company
"It would have been nice to actually been interviewed for the position before being callously informed via an informal email that I wasn't chosen.  With over 15 years and most recently more than 11+ years as an Executive Assistant to the President of a division at Universal Pictures a major motion picture studio, my experience and skills meets the basic qualifications and then some required for the position.  I am very discouraged that your recruiters are rejecting candidates without even interviewing them first.  Even with this set back, I still believe that Johnson and Johnson would be an incredible opportunity and will still continue to review job openings in the future."
Take the time to call people and let them know they weren't a right a fit. I know it takes a little bit more time but an automated email makes people feel like they're nothing more than a number. 
"I received an email receipting my application. 
After that I heard nothing back in a timely manner. Moreover approximately 2 or 3 months later I receive a rejection email and now approximately 6 months later an invite to take a survey. Overall I don't think the timings of any of the communications I received during the whole process were courteous or helpful.

"Have someone actually speak to a qualified candidate.   I know that I was qualified, as I worked in a similar position for a competitor.   Geez.  How about a little courtesy.   I know you get hundreds of resumes, but obviously some are more qualified than not.   I get it- these positions probably aren't filled from an on-lines posting but skip the form lettter.

"Besides the emails as a confirmation to had received the postulation, the team who is leading the recruiting process should inform the applicants of their hiring status in order for the applicants to know if they pass to the next stage or to tell if the recruiting process has been cancelled or finished. For those who continue, it would be helpful to appoint a talent acquisition contact in order to provide accurate information for the next steps or even some suggestions or advice will be highly appreciated considering their high expectations and interest to get hired.

The letter purpose is to suggest to J&J some changes or improvements on its recruitment process. Based on my experience, I would like to receive more information about the process, if has ended, continues or cancelled. 
In the same manner, If a candidate is pre-selected within all the applicants to continue in the process, would be very good and nice to be contacted by a Human resources team member or a kind of account manager in charge of the recruitment to give you the good news that you keep on race and even to encourage you to improve or consider some aspects at the time to get interview, this will make the difference and would be well received by the candidate. 
In addition, would be very helpful if HR send you practice tests or quiz to practice related to the position they are looking for. 
Finally, might be awesome if they consider to hire the best 3 candidates for 3 months to see how each one performs and make the best choice.  With the other 2 candidates double check if fits for any other position in the company.


To summarize, better communication between the involved parties (J&J and applicants) would gain better results in the recruitment process.
Finally, please receive, in advance, my gratefulness for considering my opinions."
"Maybe let someone know they aren't being considered for a job before sending them an email saying ""We'd like to hear from you"". For a second I thought I was being asked to do a phone interview. "

I went so long without any contact that I actually contacted the recruitment agent myself to ask about the timeline of the recruitment process, and received no response. I later found out that I had not been successful via an impersonal, blanket email which did not offer any candidate-specific feedback."
Didn't find a reason to believe why i got multiple rejections just on the basis of resume despite being meeting all the requirements.
"Some degree of communication would be appreciated. Understand there are probably thousands of applicants, but some kind of communication, such as we received your interest, thanks but we moved in another direction. Just something. "

"It is my considered opinion that recruiting for mechanical technicians would be better served by considering applicants who have prior experience working at Johnson & Johnson and who have assisted on change overs with the mechanical technicians to the degree that some of us have done. I myself graduated from the Mechatronics program at  the Lanc. County career & technology center with the AMIST 1 certification in the hope of returning to J&J after being put on layoff after six years at J&J in Lititz,Pa in 2008, it is my wish to be employed at J&J again in any capacity that would become available to me, yet as to the recruitment process, I believe that it be most beneficial to J&J to consider those who loved working at J&J and know what a great company J&J is. Those of us who want to be employed at J&J again after being put on layoff would greatly appreciate it and be of great benefit to J&J."

J&J is massively successful.  It shows. 
have someone follow up in a reasonable time with facts.
Should atleast contact to the candidate and give reason why to be fit or unfit for the positions for their betterment.
"Perhaps better review background and qualifications. With over a decade of measurable and verifiable success within medical device/biotech sales, in both territory management and regional sales management - leading a multi-disciplinary team to winning top region growth in North America four straight years - I would think I'd at least get a phone screening. To not consider my skill set and background relevant shows to me that it was probably not even looked at. I would have added great value to the J&J team, and had a high regard for the company, along with passion for the position. I understand that the candidate pool is strong; I've been in the position of hiring for similar positions before.

None. As it is good already.
No one got back to me or responded to my application. I certainly was given no reasoning behind the obvious rejection.
Be more transparent with potential candidates.
"1. Contact candidates on the status of the application. In regards to this role, I never received any status on my application.
2.  For roles interviewed on follow back in a timely manner."
Apply in a timely manner. Maybe suggest a better fit if not selected for a certain role. It would make the company standout. 
"Great company, I received zero response or an inquiry 

Best regards!!"
"No, I would think not."
A recruiter could actually contact me.

Recruiter should notify the candidates stage of application

Any others companies also competitors are very interesting to offer the job to people who are leaving JJ because they are very high skilled and they are percived as good employees. In my opinion JJ should to it best to keep all talents especially in situation when the job market is more employees market insted of employers market....."
Contact the applicant directly via phone to get to know them better. 
I feel that I was a good fit for the opportunity. I would of liked an opportunity to speak to with someone on specific skill sets required for the opportunity. 
Recruiter should call and check if the candidate is eligible before not considering for role.  
"J&J advertised a position that was not available (at all or at least for my school).

"Good evening
I think it would be very good to give us the opportunity to learn how to use the systems they handle in the maquiladora industry. For example, in my case, I think it is one of my areas of opportunity, since I do not have experience in turning , As well as giving us the opportunity to learn the English language (as in my case I do not have the requested score, but I have the best of dispositions to learn, but for the time being for economic and time, I do not have the possibility) , From here on, I think and I know that Johnson & Johnson is a great company that I would be happy to be able to belong to, and so contribute my knowledge to the company and grow much more as a person and a professional.

I also believe that this idea of making these kinds of encounters and even being able to say what we think about you is truly great, I thank you for your time and I will continue trying to be part of this great company.

Thank you."

"Provide feedback if you were not chosen for the process, especially if you advance into the Hogan test screening. The results of that test can be very useful, not only to understand why they were not chosen, but to develop profesionally and personally into a more holistic profesional. As a personal experience candidates get excited about being part of the JnJ family, giving at least some information can help them grow as profesionals and continue to have some attachment to the company."

You might have a problem with your questionnaire system, because we were never schedule to speak or interview or at least I did not receive any communication, which does not match the questions in your survey above.

My application was never accepted by the hiring managers because of my status in the US. I am on the working Visa and I was told that J AND J does not sponsor the visa and green card. I wish I got to know this before the application and also that I am not eligible to apply here not because of my talent but because of my status 
"This is the second time that I have received this email, requesting I participate in the survey. The funny thing is that I was never contacted by a recruiter or anyone, even to advise that they had moved on with other candidates. With this in mind, you requesting I complete your survey once, let alone sending me two requests is a bit aggressive. I ignored the first one and only completed this one because I assume if I do not send it, you will keep emailing it to me."
Thanks for the notification; and congratulations for the decision choosing Shared Service to be located at Bogota DC
Recruiter should update candidates the stage of their application.

"I was referred to a position by the head of your pain research group, a PHD with a long history with J&J.  My background dovetailed perfectly with the portfolio manager equities position, I managed one of the largest small cap value funds in the nation at the world's largest asset manager.  It is beyond me why I was never contacted, I assure you that that very few candidates had the institutional experience I have.  It really begs to question what you were looking for or perhaps the position was filled and the posting was a formality.  I guarantee that the person in the job does not have a fraction of the experience I have in the institutional mutual fund world.  Additionally, I know the PHD that referred me to J&J is embarrassed by your lack of organizational follow up.  Honestly, J&J's credo and culture strike me as a farce after this experience.  "
"I had an interview for this position in Providence on 16 February. The interview seemed to go well, an the following week I received an email asking for another copy of my resume.

"The fact of the matter is that I can't recall hearing anything since my application was tendered on 3/21/17. This is a senior role, I would expect a little more communication, particularly from J&J-- especially when there are other large & small companies out there that are far more communicative and respectful of an applicants time. It really reflects poorly on a well-established company when the HR process is poorly organized.

Recommendations:
1) Keep the candidate informed
2) Actionable feedback upon rejection (e.g. you lack skill X, experience X, etc.)
3) An easily accessed job portal that one can log into to check status- updates



"
Actually contact people that apply. It's a very disconnected process and seems pointless to even apply as seems Johnson & Johnson isn't even looking for good talent. 
J&J is one of the companies I wanted to work for a long time so the above rating is not based on the recruitment process. 
Pass on the feedback the reason for not choosing the candidate for the position.
If possible some feedback on why not suitable for the position 
Make more interactive and atleast try to keep applicant in the loop.
Why am I getting this email?
Contact the candidate who is interested working for the company even if they were not selected. Its the professional thing to do.
Worst experience of my life!
"Unresponsive, even though I brought to their attention a system gap.  One of the questions required multiple answers; however, the system was not allowing for multiple answers.  I reached out to the recruiter to let them know of the problem with the posting.  I also escalated the lack of response to the recruiter's Manager and I also did not receive an answer.  The process was less than professional.  It is really disappointing. "
Have someone actually reach out to your applicants 
"Improve communication with the prospective candidate and provide timely feedback as the process takes months without any communication from HR.

The recruitment process is flawed."
Call me for an interview before sending an email saying that I didn't meet the profile of the vacancy.
"I believe J&J can improve on one point:
That there is a personal contact after the application, since the candidate has the necessary qualifications."
Be more transparent.
Inform candidate why they were not selected.
"For me it is impossible to qualify the process, due I did not received notifications releated to the status recruitment along the process. It was a surprise to be notified that I was not selected due to this survey. I hope for further processes with you I may be able to received notifications releated to the status."
Don't know who is looking at resumes for you!!!
 Improving diversity opportunities will be great.
"A start would be to follow-up and be responsive to the potential candidate at every step of the interview process. My second interviewer never got back to me to schedule an interview and the recruiter sent me an email basically stating that I was selected and that J&J was completing a background check only to find out the email I received was in error. No apologies,  no response, I was left to figure it out on my own. Overall awful experience. "
Be informed about the steps in to recruitment process.
"Improve communication with the prospective candidate and provide timely feedback as the process takes months without any communication from HR.

"Some insight into why I was not qualified would have been great. However, with an organization of your size it's understandable. "
contact was by email not phone
Found that candidates who might have some college and up to 20 years of direct related experience in the role and/or pharma are not even considered for a phone interview.  Very disappointing for such a reputable company. 
Let people know within a reasonable timeframe instead of months later. Keep people updated 
Personalize responses
Reach out directly either through phone or email rather than an automated rejection.
"Just like any other company, J&J seems to be hiring internally for all mid level manager and above roles. Not sure why to play with the emotions of the prospective candidates when you are already aware who would be your internal hire."
"I applied to J&J, P&G, and GSK. The GSK recruitment process was most organized, P&G second best. J&J least organized.
This is most honest opinion as I am not currently working for any of these three companies and they are great copetitors. I have not mentioned my current employer in this comparison to avoid bias.

I believe P&G has best ability to pick talent while the J&J needs to work a lot on HR policy."
Hire me.
Follow up is key. 
"Where is the Human Side of HR ?  I understand you receive hundreds of apps for each position which makes almost impossible to review each one, I assume your are using software to screen candidates which promote wording manipulations trying to use key words, I am pretty sure J&J is an attractive company no doubt about it however recruitment process in general is missing the human side of potential candidates who can bring experience and value to the company.

For other positions that I applied for and was not selected I received a notification that I would not be moving forward.

"I didn't really get any degree of personal dialogue with a recruiter. I only got a rejection email, several weeks after applying online, and attempting to follow up, via email, for a line of communication"
Face to face contact
Reach out to candidates
Keeping the candidate updated about the process and if possible provide a feedback.
"You could/should give some kind of information, on why people are not selected for the job they applied for."
Would be nice to receive an email informing applicant they were not successful - even an automated one so they know where they stand.  I have no major gripe though regardless. 
Provide more detail feedback when you are not considered for a position.
Give you a reason so you have ideas on how to improve.
"I apply on line, and after a week or two weeks I was rejected. I did not have even the opportunity to do an interview. I consider myself a great hardworker, passionate and I have a lot to offer for J&J, but I never had the opportunity to show you everything I learned while I was studying Accounting and Finance in an American University. I couldn't explain to you how I colaborate in the International Society, the Institute of Management Accountant and the Valdosta State Investment group for my University. I went to the IMA national conference in Detroit last year, and even the recruiter of Johnson & Johnson did not want heard anything from me because I was international student in United States and that's a problem in order to sponsorship a VISA in the future. But you never kwen that I was there because before I came to United States, I tried  to be professional tennis player, that I got professional ranking, that I was studying in United States thanks to a 100% scholarship, that I graduate now with a 3.34 GPA in Accounting and Finance in 3 years and a half, and I didn't know any English before arrive to USA. You didn't know I've been helping at my parents fruit shop all my life, that I've been doing tennis lesons these last 3 years, and that I also did an internship with Cummins Inc. last year. But most important, that I do not require Visa sponsorship in Spain, and I am a very valuable asset. I respect your decision, and I know there are a lot of people out there in the same situation, but computers cannot aproach people as people do. Invest in people with solid and good values, and you will be great, but do not just focus in a number or a name that a computer randomly picks, because we all have something to learn from everybody."
"
In my view, companies of the size of Jonhson should try to create a synergy with universities in the countries in which they are represented in order to be able to seek new talent, so they can innovate in all their operations. Another issue for Rh staff should not see their employees as numbers, but rather as their most valuable asset. They should never exclude people by age (beyond the age for the open position)."
Interview me.
"Improve your follow through, even a simple email indicating that the candidate is no longer under consideration would be an improvement."
I guess it would be great to hear back concerning the position applied for
Acknowledge that someone has actually received and reviewed the information provided.  The online application is impersonal and cumbersome.
Giving an answer to applicants. 
"Continually update applicant throughout the hiring process.  Once they are no longer in consideration, a ""regret to inform"" email should be promptly sent.  "
"I have significant and successful sales experience. I was never even contacted by anyone. No phone screen. How do you know I wouldn't be a good fit if you didn't even meet with me? Very disappointing . I'm a good sales person. Your loss. I wonder if ageism was a factor. I'm only 50. I'm not impressed, I thought you valued experience. "
Communicate with candidates faster and take a chance on the people that might not fit into your ideal - those are the people that will likely make waves elsewhere. J&J is a great company but legacy isn't everything. 
basically provide a reason why the candidate is not a good fit for the position 
"There is such a delay in reaching out to me and giving me feedback. I haven't been contacted directly or told why I was not selected. Perhaps knowing if there were job fairs for J&J would be helpful too. 

I'm a mom of twins looking to re-enter the ""paid"" working world and just need a chance to prove myself. I am willing to begin on any level in the organization to make this happen for my family.

Fornecer feedback aos candidatos.

"Have your HR reps actually respond to candidates instead of generic forms. I realize that given the amount of applications this may not be possible and very likely no reason given would be acceptable to a candidate denied a position. That said, it would be nice to know if you went with an internal candidate or someone outside or possibly that the salary range was not within the candidate's expectations. Something like that. A couple of line items that wouldn't generate law suits but would inform us why we weren't acceptable to your company. In two cases (Astra-Zeneca and UPMC Pittsburgh) they actually said how proud they were of their all women staff and would continue to hire women only. Not only was this discriminatory but I was told by one of their higher ranking male execs that ""we put our women in the communications area where they can do the least harm"" - so obviously I wan't going to get anywhere there anyway. On second thought, maybe you should just continue to  give a ""zero response"" as corporate attorneys have mandated for so long. That way, we know nothing and you continue to advertise jobs for the sake of fulfilling your EEO requirements, while hiring the daughter of your Communication Director's best friend."
"I never received any information regarding the role, despite being very interested and having a colleague at J&J refer me. "
I received an email from Johnson & Johnson stating there was no interest to pursue me as a candidate for the Executive Assistant position. It was very impersonal and it would be beneficial for companies to remember that people apply to jobs they are interested in and that they want to be a part of the company for which they applied. When responses are dry and offer no reason for not showing interest it discourages the person who spent the time to apply from wanting a future position with said company.  
I applied and never heard back from anyone. There is no doubt that my experience and background met the job requirements.
"This survey is the first definitive knowledge that I am no longer a candidate. It would be helpful to have feedback related to why I was not selected to move forward, as I have current clinical experience in the required specialty, live so close to the field area that my travel and that of anyone in NY would be comparable, and meet the education requirements. Such information would be valuable for potential candidates. Thank you for the opportunity to comment!"
"Stop relying on parsing key words from resumes to invite potential candidates in.  Additionally don't preclude individuals simply based on no prior ""pharma"" experience.  You lose a lot of potential great talent that way.  Lastly and most importantly if you do have someone in for an interview and are one of the finalists if they do not get an offer let them know at the least by email.  I was in for an interview in November of 2016 and was told I would be informed either way of the outcome.  I followed up a week later and then again two weeks after that and never heard back."
Give reasonable consideration to outstanding candidates who have also been recommended by Professional peers
"Put the ""personal"" back in the process.   Very little if any feedback, no in person interaction at all.   With primarily sales or sales management positions in particular, if you are relying on a resume only or ""piece of paper"", you are missing a huge HR advantage to finding and yielding the best talent at the beginning of the process.  Also, it appears actual resumes are not reviewed.  For example, with the little scrap of written feedback one may get in the denial process, it may say,  ""sorry we are looking for veteran"" and it says clearly right on the persons resume that they are in fact a veteran.  That is just a slap in the face.  "
"J&J is the creme de la creme of companies. It would seem that the reputation and brand attracts top talent. I worked for J&J while a consultant at PwC. I was impressed with the company and enjoyed the culture and employees very much. 

In terms of the process, I think the online portion was fairly straightforward with no issues. I have to wonder about the job description and the candidates and competition - in my case I thought is was a good match in terms of skills and experience. I do a lot of recruiting myself, and I can say that those high on the list (at least the top 10) always get an initial call from me as the first screen for cultural fit, experience, and communication skills. While a 30 minute conversation does not allow one to make a final decision, it always provides good insight into the person and whether I should invite them in for further consideration. 

I am not aware of J&J's training and how talent is managed - however, I think it is a good practice to be proactive and engaging if the candidate warrants it. 

J&J is a great company and I hope to work there someday! "
I did not interact with a recruiter. My only contact was a rejection email a few days after I submitted my application. 
More transparency.. I didn't even know whether I was selected or not. 
"My only feedback was 7 emails sent within 5 minutes of each other. Six of these emails included language ""Your Application Is Under Review"". In the MIDDLE of these emails was one stating that the hiring manager ""...has chosen not to pursue your candidacy..."".
This is a small industry. I knew the name of the individual selected for this position several days before I received the formal emails that my 'application is under review'. My suggestion is to update the tracking system to ""Your Application Is Under Review"" as soon as applications have a) moved forward to the hiring manager, and/or b) been screened out as not meeting requirements. "
I interviewed for a different position with Depuy Synthes -- I've not yet been informed of my status after two phone screens. I'm assuming I was eliminated and J&J simply failed to notify me.
"I have applied several positions in Johnson & Johnson in last 4 months in the same city with pharmaceutical experience. I had a standard mail with a standard note mentioning I haven't been selected. 
It would be great to know the real reason of rejection. Surely you can not respond every applicant in details. But at least hiring managers can use check boxes from from a group of let say 10 rejection reasons list. Thus applicant gets an automatic mail with the rejection reasons included. 
With this way, applicant can decide to keep posting for more positions or no more posting. Hiring manager will get less inappropriate applications next time. Win win for all. 
I can share more example if you need. 
All the best.

Connect with employment submissions. I have not heard from anyone.
It would be nice to give some job-application feedback. 
I would say the best way to improve the recruitment process to follow up with reasoning for not being qualified. I am working on improving my skill set and experience to eventually re apply so a follow up on ways to improve my overall resume would be great.
To give a satisfactory answer when the candidate is not fit. 
At least inform the candidate that their application is not selected.
Personal phone calls.
give the opportunity of an interview.
Communicate openly with candidates and when offered a date to come in for an assessment that doesn't fit then don't leave them waiting for another date to then find out you are not progressing 
I haven't received a phone call from Johnson & Johnson as of yet but the online application process was easy to follow.
It can provide feedback but it is understandable with the large amount of applicants that it is not always possible.
Actually Call you
"Imagino a quantidade de candidatos inscritos, mas acredito que uma vez que vocês abrem uma vaga no site e tenha inscrições a empresa deve no mínimo dar um retorno por qualquer canal que seja.

respond to applications
"I got through the tests which I feel I did well in. 

Then there were issues with my video interview, it kept getting the date pushed back and when I did it, there was no word back. I didn't hear anything until over six months later to hear I didn't get it. Overall the experience was disappointing and I can't believe I could get past rounds which not many pass and actually hear nothing back. 

Would not recommend. "
Never heard a word from J&J
Actually call people
I was not contacted by a recruiter or anyone else for the Project Leader Regulatory Affairs (8572170131) position.  
Better communication.  I never hear any feedback or what I can improve upon to join the team.  
I have been applying for a year and a half and still have not received a single phone call. A phone call to tell me where I went wrong or how to improve my chances would be greatly appreciated.

In all cases Johnon & Johnsonn is a magnific Company.

"As with all large companies, the reliance on software to scan resumes means that good candidates will slip through the cracks.  I have a tremendous base of business knowledge and have a very strong sales skillset, yet I didn't receive even a phone screen on what I could bring to the company.  It's J&J's loss.  "
Conduct phone interviews and let people know either way giving feedback.
The experience was very smooth and pleasant. I have no recommendation for improvement.
Johnson & johnson make prospective employer as highly influenced.
"The lack of communication contributed to my scores. I am beyond qualified for the positions I applied for but all I received was ""not the right fit"". I would like to see J & J become the pioneers that would at least let candidates know why they weren't chosen. As a prospective candidate, we cant change anything if we don't know the cause. I have emailed an inquiry as to what the reason was that I was not at least chosen to interview and I have never gotten a response.

Thank You :)"
Timely Feedback
Perhaps actually reviewing candidates resumes and experience would be a start.  
Make sure that recruiters actually reply to the candidates with the qualifications required for the position and they provide them with the reasons that they were not selected for the position. 
Better and more timely feedback.
I have applied for many positions at J&J but never heard anything back other than priodic rejections. I took at as being over qualified.
I never received any contact. 
I realize the large size of J&J makes it virtually impossible to reach out to every candidate. Thank you for seeking feedback 😊
Start communicating over the phone or a detailed email communication.
"Sometime a resume could be not enough to evaluate a candidate, even for a skilled recruiter."
A more in-depth follow up with professional candidates. What was the selection committee looking for in the ideal candidate comparative to the expertise and background I brought to the role? 
Reach out to applicants 
"Unfortunately many companies like J&J (whom I have worked with as my customer in the past) lose out on talent because HR only thinks very narrowly on  filling a position with someone who has an exact background looking to be filled, rather than in my case for an example, an excellent sales executive who could rapidly learn a product, the competition and the ""pitch (I already have a great understanding of who your decision makers are). 

You can learn a product but you can rarely teach sales ability. You either have it or you don't!"
Actually communicate to candidates other than sending these stupid surveys
Give feedback
Relationship with the candidate
"Please give me feedback, Don't know if I missing something"
"In my point of view, nothing more is necessary.

The feedback is always given, which is the most important thing on the recruitment process..

I think that is important to give more information. 
Make sure to update candidate when they are not being considered for a position. I am an MBA student and I applied for job that only requires a Bachelors and i keep getting denied for them. I do not get it. 
It was weeks after I applied before getting any response. I had already moved on to more responsive opportunities.
Nobody ever contacted me regarding this position.
"Constructive criticism and feedback as to why I was not a good fit for the position would be nice. I do realize that breaking into pharmaceutical sales is very competitive, however, I would like feedback for my self development. "
"Provide some simple but polited contact with all candidates.
I believe anyone who is applying for a job is aware that the answer can be negative, and in my opinon, this is the key moment that can make a difference between companies/employers. A brief phone call can make a huge difference and let the candidate with a good image from the company he was applying for."
Hire me and I'll be happy to share my thoughts.
Provide examples as to why you are not considered for the position.
"I understand the challenges of sorting applicants when you receive 100s of resumes for every job. But many times, the structure of the on-line application and resume formats don't bring out the true commitment, capabilities and passion of the job applicant. Include a few questions that focus on the creative and innovative quotient of the candidate. You simply might end up with a more productive employee who also exemplars in best in humanity."
Better screening for reviewing candidature
Communication. I was an internal candidate and I like working for J&J but this application process was terrible. I was never communicated with at all. The internal application process was not easy to find on the internet. It definitely left me with a sour taste for how J&J hires. It seemed like I was never given a chance. 
"I was never contacted by anyone, seems you have no clue in your organization here!  "
Give me a job offer!)
"I have never seen such a slow and unresponsive system.  You are lucky anyone wants to work there given the poor execution of your hiring process.

I am pretty done with your team.  Good luck!"
Make the process easier by reducing the number of fields required to submit an application. Give some sense that an actual human reviewed my resume and gave it proper consideration.
"Very disappointed in this process.  I was rejected 1 day after applying for this position, and never heard anything beyond I was no longer under consideration for this position.  Very disappointed."

I texted the manager since I had met him a few times and he responded with a lukewarm ok, apply on line. I never heard anything back. He hired someone he knew and was planning to hire all along. My submitting a resume and following up was a complete waste of time. I was perfectly qualified for the position with top sales, relationships, science degree and MBA. This manager has a huge ego so it may be best that I have moved on and found a different position. This manager hired someone who is a mirror image of himself. He is prejudiced towards women and older workers. This J and J manager needs more training on a diverse workforce. "
Communicate with the candidates. Everyone wants you to take a survey but there isn't an service to survey.
Improve communication with the prospective candidate and provide timely feedback as the process takes months without any communication from HR.
"As you let me know, the recruiters should contact us to say that I was not qualified for the job.

Thanks"
"If don't accept a candidate, please let him/her know the result."
"Definitely get back to the candidates sooner and quicker. Johnson and Johnson is a great company to wish I could meet with a recruiter so I can get to work for a company that truly cares about its customers, employees and the patients that are taking Johnson and Johnson's life saving medicine and the regular everday house hold items."
No improvement needed
"As a courtesy, a notification of not qualifying for the position would be sufficient instead finding out that you were not a fit through a survey.   I think highly of Your company and will continue to seek opportunity. "
At least contact the people via e-mail or so... I just have the information that this opportunity is not for me.
Provide feedback to the candidates
It is correct the process.
Time and time again it appears that your external recruitment process is really not that at all. It seems that most rolls posted are actually filled by internal applicants. Why continue posting rules if you are filling them with internal candidates. It's frustrating and creates a poor image to the External community. 
I was never contact by anyone about the position. I never had the chance to speak with anyone about the position. I never received an interview for the position. I was never given any feedback as to why qualifications were not a match. I did not receive any areas to include in my development plan as a J&J employee to strengthen my skills if I was not a fit for the position. I would like to compare my experience with the person who got the position.

Actually recruit people with talent and proof of high academic performance instead of just hiring people with connections. Luckily I got a high paying job that seems to fit me better than a job at J&J but it would have been nice to at least have gotten an interview since my GPA was high and I had a decent resume. Disappointed with the recruitment process overall. Only doing this survey to stop getting emails.

"For such an established company your recruiting process is the worst. The days of submitting your resume into a black hole are gone yet J&J still operates this way. You should also know, in the digital industry, Candidates view JJ as a place that only hires young people. That is a perception you don't want."
Respond when someone applies!
"After collecting all the resume go through it one by one thoroughly . Most of the HR are not done that part end to end.

Call the candidate to inform whether that person got selected or not , because everything is not possible to see through mail or text. Moreover it can be expected from a world recognised company only. 

For an example  i have more than 19 months of work experience in Genpact India pvt. ltd. in Accounts Payable ( P2P ) , and the number of positions for which i have applied , 80% of those job activity are same to my profile but i did not received any call .

"The recruitment process, from my experience, was a black hole.

I submitted an application on 11/4/2016, then some time later (3/20/2017) received a form letter informing me they had found more qualified candidates.  I have 16 years of experience in Consumer Insights and Market Research, yet did not even qualify for a screening call.

I can't speak to how the recruiter acted/did not act as I was never contacted by anyone.

While I have a great deal of respect for the company, as they are an industry leader, I am disappointed in what seems to be an impersonal and puzzling recruiting process.

To date, I've applied to 4 different positions at J&J, three of them within insights specifically, and have never been contacted by a recruiter."
"Send a e-mail or call. Let candidates know that they are not being considered. However, this is the way of the corporate recruiting world. I don't expect any potential employer to send me a notice that my application has been rejected. If a potential employer did send me something I would be more inclined to re-apply. I hope this helps!"
"Excellent recruiters, only the selection process is slow"
"It would seems that Johnson and Johnson has a surplus of applicants applying for the positions or their is a complete lack of follow up.  I continually get requests for surveys on the hiring process for the company, however the same due diligence is not applied to contacting the applicant in regards to the position for which they applied."
The recruitment process was really excellent!
Provide any kind of feedback.  Automated messages are useless.
The phone screener could have been more knowledgable about the position and more professional.
Be fair and transparent. 
"Well you can contact the candidate, first to review experience and knowledge and let know how the process will be conducted, and second to acknowledge if candidate had received a not applicable letter."
"I don't even remember if I ever got a response (I think I didn't) but if I did it was long enough ago for me to forget about it. So I suggest if you send a survey, send it directly after your feedback on the application. "
"Honestly, you should post your open positions on your web site so candidates don't have to go through recruiters.  Also, I already have my resume on your job site.  Good talent would always rather go to the company that is willing to hire them, not the company that posts through recruiters.  

I just got a call from a recruiter for a similar job at J&J, and don't think I will submit.  I would rather work for an organization directly. 

I think J&J is a good company, but as with all companies nowadays, the recruiting process is getting worse and worse.  I currently work as an ESL teacher and a statistics tutor and I am happier with that than I would be working for a recruiting firm.  

I think I am going to boycott recruiting firms and organizations that use them.

I recommend the talent acquisition team to phone screen candidates.
Take the job postings down from the internal site once you know you have a potential candidate.  I applied for this position because the posting was still listed in the internal site and the hiring manager had already made up her mind so I did not have a chance to interview.  
You should explain the reason why you do not select a candidate
Notify te reasons with not qualify to the job for telephone call and reccomendations to the person apply the job
"I was contacted and asked to participate in 8 phone interviews before having an interview with the hiring manager. After I have completed all 8 interviews I never heard back.

The whole process was disappointing to say the least since I spent 8 hours of my time only to be completely ignored later."

"You need to give chance to ppl.who apply even without work experience, you never meet them or talk with them, so you don't really know the knoweleg or maybe they are smarter and fast learners.Better invite all ppl who apply for the job you offer and have conversation with them and then chose who go further.Not only you send email that the team didn't chose etc. Never judge a book by it's cover"
"One of the reasons I applied for that position was because of JJ's culture and being known as a great employer.

"Applying via the portal feels very much like you are just throwing your resume against the wall and hoping that you picked up on enough keywords to actually get in front of a real person. While this is the reality of modern HR / recruitment, it feels like being considered is more a game of chance than an opportunity to prove oneself as the right candidate for the job.  Absent a connection who can bypass HR and get your resume in front of the hiring manager, this feels like a near-impenetrable gate."

As a candidate who meets 100% of the stated job requirements and takes the time to complete your horrifically cumbersome online application process, I would have in the very least expected a more detailed explanation as to why I wasn't selected for an interview. I also would have expected some feedback sooner than a month after I applied.

Actually talk to potential employees to get a real perspective on them.
"I am not sure J&J needs to do anything.  The online application process is easy and no more difficult than your market competitors.  I am certain you actively recruit top talent from high-ranking MBA and scientific programs, which is crucial.  The mid-level talent will simply follow that top-level talent, with minimal effort on your part.  "
Just a proper feedback on each stage of the process. We are all human beings and empathy es a key feature in every single aspect of our lives.
"My experience and knowledge in the field of communications is vast -- with 6 pharma companies and three mergers, as well as global expertise. I believe I would be a great fit for the company, however, no one ever calls me back after i apply for suitable positions. "
Reply back with information 
Recruiter was not familiar enough with investments to understand my qualifications and have a meaningful dialogue.  Given this disconnect I think a phone interview with the hiring manager would have made sense.  I feel my bacckground and qualifications for the position was a perfect match for the job description.  It was not explained to me why I wasn't given the opportunity to speak with a hiring manager.
"I assume I was randomly selected for this survey.  I did apply for the role, it was pulled within 24 hours and I never heard anything else. I did not know I wasn't a fit until I read the survey."
Speed it up
I think it is important to contact an applicant with any feedback once he or she has applied for a position. Otherwise it feels like applications posted online are never considered 
"At least , it should give a feedback about the process"
Offer feedback to applicants
More feedback would be beneficial.
I have no idea why I received this. I had no other messages from HR except for that
N/A
Just give a feedback. 
A direct contact would have helped as I could have inquired as to why I was not selected for an interview.
Only with a call or email with final response. 
"Hire from colleges that isn't Ivy league or big name schools from north dakota, montana, and south dakota. "
Offer Feedback to candidates and say to  what was the failure to this process. 
"communicate with the candidates and be little more clear when it comes to selection process. The recruiters never reach the candidates and only a automated email is sent out with standard message that you are no good we found one, there is not transparency to ensure that the candidate lacked few things or was over qualified. "
"I am getting really annoyed with Jand J in Schaffhausen. I have applied for countless positions now, where I thought I was a decent match for the role. Not a peep from your recruiters in Switzerland - something is clearly awry in how they conduct the hiring process, clearly! I am starting to expect that the renowned Swiss xenophobia is playing a role!!!"

To communicate with applicants.
Communicate better
I interviewed with Johnson & Johnson last August for the role of Senior Supply Chain Compliance Manager and after four intensive interviews received a scripted reply.  I still don't know where I went wrong and having someone reach out to me would have been very helpful.
I never got contacted by a recruiter.
Please take the time to call and provide feedback on any application
"I am a J&J employee and I didn't receive consideration for this position or others after 16 years of high performance, documented success and numerous promotions.  There is no HR presence from the very top to the very bottom.  The J&J employee experience has been eroded significantly.  In my opinion their commitment to their employees has diminished.
"
It's great to have any response from the recruiting company. Even if it's an automatic rejection letter.
"Consistency, prior to my initial online assessment i received two emails the first inviting me to complete the online section and later that day one inviting me for a face to face interview which was sent in error. It does not provide a good first impression and when you are a recent college graduate looking for your first step up into your career and excitment and nerves are key emotions a false hope fosters poor self morale. Then after the online assessment there is no feedback to learn why you were unsuccessful."
"By give me a chance to work with Johnson & Johnson, it will show me how the recruitment process goes and I will be able to tell what kind of improvement needed."
We should send any feedback either qualified to do an interview or not via mail or any one contact me instead of no one call me till now
Nothing different from other talent recruiter board. Good layout though
Não tive contato ou entrevista.
I signed up for varios opportunities but i was never called or receive any feddback.
"My inglish is poor su please forgive my mistakes.
The recruiter never got in touch with me and this isn't the first time I apply to a job post. I have job alets for Johnson & Johnson/Janssen and in Mexico it seems that there not aware of the web site.
Thanks for taking my comment."
Provide reasons why somone is not a good fit for the position
It would be Goodyear to have more feedback about the recruitment process. 
Give feedback for all candidates
I believe that for some IT related problem I did not receive the email informing that I did not go through the recruitment process.
Provide feedback
"Nobody got in touch with me in this process, but I'm sure  if I were hired I would bring a lot of profit to the company.

"   All in all, the treatment for recruitment process Johnson & Johnson has is above other companies, but the informations can be more accurate when a process is not positive to the candidate.
   Thank you for the attention."
"I have never gone through a recruitment process with J&J therefore I do not understand why this email has been sent to me twice. 

I have sent my CV to J&J although I have never been contacted to participate in a recruitment process. 

Feedback given does not therefor apply in my case. "
Invest time in getting to know the candidates beyond their resume.
Provide a followup email why I was not a good fit and that my application was reviewed by someone. I found out via this survey instead.
"I interviewed for three different positions and at no point did the recruiter call to follow up with me. I had to reach out to all three hiring managers to get an update. Only two of the three responded. Additionally, one of the three hiring managers who interviewed me by phone seemed to have little interest in my professional experience. She opened with personal questions and spent less than 15 minutes interviewing me. I felt as though she had made a decision prior to contacting me and did so only out of some sense of obligation.  It was a very disappointing experience all the way around. "
"I think that the company has to be more carefull in the way the treat the candidates. I did not receive any comment or feedback. 
"
Not advertised roles and then put them on hold 
"Provide feedback about the process is quite respectful, specially if he candidate is not selected. 

The time between each interview is quite long so the candidate does not know if  another activity must be expected or the process is finished."
More communication and better system for recruitment.
I never heard back from J&J nor the talent acquisition team or recruiter. If someone had the courtesy to respond it would be great. But this was not the case. 
Confirm in the email to Candidate
"The most important thing about the recruitment process is to maintain an equal job opportunity for the people who have applied in the Panama Local Market.

Communicate the feedback to the applicants
"It would be kind of you to either Contact candidates or close your requisition. 

But don't leave people stranded  without information. 

 Of course we all know that if you are not called, chances are you didn't get the job or will not get it. But by sending the computer - generated humane message, at least you are not left to wonder. 

My children have used Johnson and Johnson products and so have I. Your brand is highly respected. I would have loved to work for you.

"
"1) Provide timely and clear, honest updates
2) Clearly explain the timeline of the process
3) If the hiring manager is not interested, they should just say so and not just be unresponsive.
4) So it looks like the CREDO is just for namesake as I did not feel that the recruiting team really cared for the candidates to provide any input on the recruitment."
It would be better if provide the reason that not qualified for the position.
"No tengo ninguna razón, respuesta ni retroalimentación sobre las varias aplicaciones que he hecho. El proceso de reclutamiento y seleccion de J&J deja mucho que desear."
"It is difficult to have an opinion since I do not have any experience in the recruitment process at the moment because in the postulations I send I do not have any contact with you, but if you do this type of surveys, I imagine it's a great company that cares By its staff

Keep more in touch with the applicants and guiding through the process.
"Après deux semaines sans aucune nouvelle et avoir rencontré le gérant avec une bonne entrevue, j'ai appris que je n'avais pas eu le poste par un xourtuel automatisé de votre système informatique.

Je crois qu'il y a moyen de faire mieux que ça en 2017. Merci"
They should do the initial interview not be based scoring and screening system due to unfairness 
Marketing
I would have appreciated speaking with an American about the selection process.
"Acknowledge receipt of applications, contact applicants that position has been filled or that they have not been selected. "
"May be to have a better communication with candidates that want to collaborate and add value to J&J. In my case, I am an experienced professional that already worked for J&J 20 years ago and expected a different treatment. I am sure that this bad communication was part of a misunderstanding and I am still very enthusiastic in having the chance to work again for J&J in the near future. All the best."
A follow up by telephone with respect to the status of being selected as a candidate.
"Deberían avisar por cualquier medio, que yo no sigo en el proceso de selección.
Should notify by any means, that I do not continue in the selection process."
"I didn't get a rejection email. I only got the email with this survey so I suggest, start by rejecting the candidates first and explain the core reasons for the lengthy wait and eventual rejection in that email. 
I believe that will be very helpful in the future. Thank you for considering my application. 

"
 It is hard to explain the hiring process of this organization.
Instead of phone interview for screening candidates there should be another way of selecting candidates. So that both of parties get fair chance to present each other.
"I believe that by continuing to deliver this feedback, it helps and a lot of people improve their development. Thank you
"
Yes
"More feedback about why a candidate is not chosen, and what they need to do in order to become a viable candidate in the future"
"Explain the reason why the candidate is not a good fit. Like this, the person is more instructed and knows a bit more when she/he should apply or not. "
Don't reject someone and then bombard them with surveys
"The survey is nice, but its funny to not give me a good reason why I wasn't a fit for the position, and then asking if you did.

3/10 rating of J&J was based on recalls due to contamination and incorrect ingredient concentration issues."
It will be great if we get atleast opportunity to talk with recruiting manager or recruiter.
To provide the reason why I was not a good fit for this job opportunity 
"Accurate communication.....
I was NEVER interviewed, for that matter, I was NEVER tested, let alone contacted by anyone, BUT according to JnJ , I was considered, INTERVIEWED, and TESTED.... for more than just ONE position 

The referral program has major problems 

Everything from applying to getting the notice of NOT being hired has been troubling "
"J&J recruiters/talent acquisition specialists could at least start by providing feedback on the status of the applications, i have applied to several jobs and do not know the status of my candidature, it has been some time. I have only received feedback for one. The others no, one of the others doesn't even has had several name changes. 
For the rejection i received, i did not received honest/transparent feedback, i realize that J&J must receive tons of candidatures but there are so many minuses and this does not help."

Just maintain the candidate update and aware of the proccess.
Reply the application and explain why you don't match the position
Have more personal involvement as opposed to only using automated emails as well as fixing all the technical issues with the website. 
The recruiter need contact us and inform about the recruitment process.
Reach out to candidates within two weeks and explain process. Articulate what was not optimal regarding candidates materials.  With over 25 years of trading experience in global securities I find it hard to believe my background didn't warrant any conversation. 
Timely feedback would be helpful
"more communication. time & shape
Thanks

Marco"
the recruitment process can improve giving a feedback when the candidate was not selected for the position.
Actually contact an applicant
"Mention a clear list of requirements for Each Job  & notify applicants of reasons why they were not selected - if no time for them Just tell generally in one letter criteria based on which people get refused.
The team gets to select whoever they want with no explanation
"
better communication with candidates
"They never called me to a recruitment process, just I received an email with the information regarding that you did not select me to continue in the process."
"Actually reach out to qualified applicants and don't filter out on predefined rules created by non technical experts. Consult the actual team lead when making a job posting. For instance, you do not need a PhD or MD to be a data scientist as evidenced by the actual team members. I have not met a single data scientist at J&J that has either of those degrees. Yet there is still a check box filter on the application to enter whether you have those degrees."
"Recruit people not only base on experienced but on the actual part of the job as well , Examination / Test if different from the Actual Job , some one maybe job in Writing but in the actual process they dont have idea on the is the actual scenario ... "
Contact the candidate and give some feedback.
I did not hear back from johnson and johnson for a month after my interview. Very rude

Properly disposition candidates within the application tracking system.  All I have ever received is an email to complete a survey but nothing on the actual positions I have applied for.
"Although I understand that it is hard to provide feedback to all the applicants, it would be nice to state the reasons for which the recruiter decides not to progress further with the application."

Please fix the error so that we candidates can apply for new job oppenings. "
"I understand candidate's profile might not fit your needs, however a sized response might increase the profesional touch of your great company "
"The business needs are understandable, it would be appreciated to contact te applicants and provide a reason why they were turned down for the position applied to, this would help both sides to work on their profile, especially the applicant who could understand the reasons and improve his profile if needed or to understand the relevance, overqualified, underqualified, etc.
Thank You.

Provide an explanation why you were not selected to progress in the process - especially for internal candidates
It could be a better experience if the recruiter had share information or feedback about the process.
Non saprei 
Despite receiving this survey I was never contacted by J&J for this recruitment process.
give constructive feedback; not just a form email
"J'aurais aimé recevoir un appel téléphonique pour m'informer du choix de l'entreprise.
"
At least give a brief initial interview to applicants that seem to have the proper knowledge & experience (but from another industry) before they send out an e-mail saying there were better applicants.
"If HR be so kind to reply to the candidates whether positive/negative, that will enhance the recruitment process. I believe, not responding to the candidates show the value given to the people in J&J. Although most ""powerful"" companies tend to ignore most of the applications so thought to be ""weak"" to them; those may be the greatest ones that the company may have missed to recognize. I doubt this comment will take into consideration, yet, I hope someone will take it seriously. Regards."
Giving a chance all candidates and making interview
"Either online or in person, I haven't been invited to any tests regarding my qualities for the position. I haven't got any phone calls or emails.

Even though I put extra effort to highlight my skills and the reasons why I was a good fit for the position I applied for on the J&J recruitment page - rather than simply using my LinkedIn account details - J&J has not put any effort to inform me about the process. I only know that one of the positions I applied for has been closed due to a strategic decision, and that mail was sent to all applicants and it was not about me obviously.

I can easily see that J&J are missing a lot of talents because of poor recruitment processes in Turkey."

It's important to provide feedback

"What Johnson & Johnson can do to improve their recruitment process is to provide serious consideration to those beyond the stringent pre-qualifications set out in the parameters of the job posting. For instance I have been tested and have genius status with an exceptional proven track record in business development your organization has missed. The bottom line is job performance, that equivalent or greater experience trumps an education. Johnson & Johnson lets those of us with these exceptional qualifications slip through the cracks; missing out on the benefits I could provide.  "
"In the recruitment process for Johnson & Johnson I receive calls from recruiting companies to apply on my behalf. I normally receive these calls from a few different companies and they all want exclusive rights to my application. I understand it is a business, but they act like vultures by telling me how great a match they believe I am for the position. At one time I was encouraged by these calls but no more.
Because I need (and want) to work, I go along and fill out all their paperwork. The sad part is I have not once received an in-person interview at Johnson & Johnson. The recruitment process is souring me on your company and I have now come to realize my outstanding skills and work ethic will not be able to support your company’s mission and vision. 
I am currently working on a professional doctorate but my resume is limited to a long tenure in one company and a few stops before. It is clear to me, the Johnson & Johnson recruitment process hires for “where someone is running from (last employment), instead of where someone is running to.”

I was fortunate that I had come across a poterntial recruiter at a conference.

when you have some potential talent that knocks at your doorstep at least giving 5 to 10 minutes of your recruiting time to speak directly to the person like you will do during a networking session then you will be able to gauge if you have to proceed to pursue by setting up a formal interview.

"The recruitment process was good.  Kris Bodson and Eliza Foo from Tax ASPAC were sincere, professional and personable.  Vicky Hsiao, Country Recruiter from Talent Acquisition was very patient and warm when sharing J&J's corporate culture and offer details.  Cheryl-Ann from Robert Walters was professional and helpful.

It was a really tough decision to decline the offer because the Singapore tax manager opportunity was a good role and I was very impressed with J&J.  Regrettably, after much deliberation, at that point in time, I decided to stay put in my existing company.  Nevertheless, I will be keen if opportunities in J&J arise again."

"Allow me to take this evaluation frankly. I personally like to work at Johnson and Johnson alot, without recruiter influence, I would have rate the company to highly favourable ( 8-9) 

Upon this position, I didn't get any feedback at all. However as another position in which I have been invited for the interview, the recruiter was not punctual at all. 

Example Case: 

- She told me she would let me know the result by Friday, but no results were inform until the following Tuesday. ( I called her on that Friday but she say it's still on process) 

- She told me that my available timeline didn't fit, so I offered her some other alternatives as I'm still on my last semester. Thus she said she will contact me back in few minutes but it actually took her almost a week. ( This time I didn't call back.) 

Please do take this feedback as an issue to improve rather than negative words towards your company.

"At least have your recruiters pretend to care about the people that apply for your company! There is absolutely zero follow up!

Second time I went through the proces, after my second interview I didn't hear back until 1.5 later.

I did enjoy the assessment even though it was difficult and challenging with the different types of assessments involved and time limits included.It shows how important the recruitment process is in selecting the correct candidate. Even though I have had no contact with you since that time, I would still apply and go through the process again.

"I was never contacted one way or another for months. I was highly qualified for the position, yet had no response until months later when I received a simple denial note. I received multiple offers from other employers for similar or positions of greater responsibility. I accepted a position as General Counsel and am quite pleased with the decision.
I think very highly of J & J, yet the on-line recruiting systems leaves a great, great deal to be desired. A simple, personal response was certainly called for, especially for this level of a position."
"I was being interviewed for the position of Clinical Associate in one of the medical devices companies of the J&J family last year. The process took 3.5 months and I made it to the final stage.

Hope such a reputable company is able to keep high standards of treating potential candidates with respect even in an overcrowded job market.

"I had an onsite interview in Jacksonville, after multiple skype interviews.  The hiring mgr committed to make decision within 24-48 hrs after the onsite visit.  He contacted me 2 days later and said that the hiring team needed another week.  I never heard back from him again.  I left him multiple voicemails but he failed to have the common courtesy to return my call to communicate a hiring decision. His name is Jimmy LaBuz.  Given the poor recruiting experience, my consumer spending will be redirected to J&J competition.  My impressions of J&J degraded from strongly positive to strongly negative, not because of the decision itself, but driven by the lack of communication in the hiring process.  To compound the experience, there was some miscommunication between J&J and the rental car company, so I was left to pay the expenses and the admin did not return my calls for expense reimbursement.  I was less than impressed by the experience, specifically Jimmy labuz and the coordinating admin.   I would have expected that they exhibited the same values as espoused by the J&J credo.  It appears that prospective employees who travel across the country in a 24 hr period for an onsite interview are excluded from the credo.  Thank you for the opportunity to share my feedback.  -Rick"
Figure out who you interviewed. FYI. I was never interviewed!
Stop discriminating based on age.
"i did a business review of Johnson & Johnson in graduate school and was really impressed with the corporate culture. I even tried to apply for intern type programs but as an older adult learner could understand not really getting in. Unfortunately, after numerous attempts at trying to get hired I have given up all hope at least for now. I understand all things in timing and maybe some time."

"After 27 years of experience working in the pharmaceutical industry I was subject to a highly deficient interview process. I can describe it as a casual and brief phone contact. I felt it was just an intent to demonstrate compliance with the interview process. Never had so bad experience with an interview. 

I was able to find a new job within a month after leaving my former employer in Sao Paulo, Brazil. I will be brutally honest, I am happy not being considered for the position.

Finally, if you really want to do something, assure the phone screening process is as professional as the face to face interview and make it happens as close as possible to the opening of the vacant. It is not a good idea to make last minute phone calls to close the gaps of such an important process.

For some reason I didn't receive any feedback. I didn't even know that I hadn't been chosen.
your team is working fantastic
I would like to receive an email or phone call to let me know where I stand in the recruitment process.  Am I a candidate?  Do I meet the qualifications?  And so on.  
Contact individuals who apply directly without the use of an automated system such as a computer.
"Clear and timely communication. I understand completely that there are several moving parts during interview process. However, that is precisely the reason why companies have recruiters- in order to coordinate the activity."
Lacking proper communications between company and candidate.
Direct contact to person by phone call
The recruiter was so serious. I did not feel empathy.
"call, pursue, recruit and hire those applicants with solid, consistent, stable years  at one or two companies within the industry, and are clearly wanting to join your team by applying to multiple positions.  These people often have many talents to bring to the organization, as they are the most flexible with change.  "
"I would encourage recruiters to at least respond PERSONALLY to the applicants who apply for advertised positions and then wait forever to hear the result. It is important to acknowledge their efforts, or else the company might lose a valuable candidate for the job. I would also encourage recruiters to explain in few words to candidates on why their application was rejected and what could they do to improve their candidature for future recruitment. This will tremendously benefits J&J's image. "
İşe başvuru tapan aday ile mutlaka iletişime geçmeli. Mail yolu ile değil. Telefon veya yüz yüze iletişim şeklinde olabilir. Bı şekilde başvuru yapan aday kendisini daha iyi ifade eder. Böylelikle şirket de yetenekleri elinden kaçırmaz. 
There are so many internet applicants - I understand how difficult it is to have personal contact. Just let the ATS do what it does.
"The time between my submission and feedback from Johnson & Johnson was less than 24 hours. Nobody from Johnson & Johnson reached out to me and I have no idea why i wasn't the perfect fit for the position.

The only thing I received was a standard message."
We are expecting the proper reason for not taking up the application
"I applied through a recruiter for a position as Sr. Counsel and was told that I had an interview. The recruiter never booked the interview and then after numerous follow ups on my part found out that they decided not to call me in. Some transparency as to the process would be helpful. However, I do appreciate J&J as a company. "
Review the resume correctly.
The process is very slow for jobs that I believe I am a direct fit for. For jobs that I'm not a good fit the response is quick and I appreciate that. Thanks!
"It is very good, didn't find a job yet though"
"Try to watch over the CV, the best recruitment process would provide at least 10 minute of oral meeting, to look the real intentions of the candidate. On the paper you don't know nothing about the real  being of a person."
Well.. have been told to be in a second interview. Email arrived not for anything further up. Interviewer seemed less interest in interviewee. Sorry. Not again for Johnson. 
You can show on scheduled phone interviews. It is very disappointing to be waiting in front of the phone.
"For some positions, an automated email saying that you did not qualify would not be enough for people to improve their skills.
You may need to narrow down your selection criteria in order to reduce number of applications, whenever you want to avoid contacting people to give them feedback."
"Although I received no communication from a recruiter, I did receive an email stating this position was cancelled at the moment.  I believe Johnson & Johnson is a great company and hope to get the opportunity to be a part of Johnson & Johnson community.  I do have extensive compliance audit experience in pharma and device to add.  Only improvement I would like to comment is that communication could be sooner.  "
a more personal approach
The new job website is very hard to navigate. You should be able to put in a company or city within Johnson and Johnson and pull up all the jobs for that field. The old job site was more user friendly.
Contact me. I was never contacted.
"The fact that J&J requested I take this survey when I never heard a single word in response to my original application is indicative of the short-circuited state of the Company's recruitment process.
I never spoke to a human regarding my application. In fact, I would be stunned if human eyes even looked at my resume to determine the fit was not good enough to even justify human contact.
And this is not the first time J&J has reached out to me under the exact same set of circumstances. With these recruiting and HR policies, J&J is ruining its reputation with potential employees, and its larger overall brand as a Company. It's a great shame."
I think you should at least let someone know when they are not being considered for a position.  I am not even sure why I am receiving this survey since all I received from you was and electronic email saying that you got my application.  
Given to us a feedback!
Silence was what I heard after the initial screening interview and the interview with the local MSL.  It was quite unprofessional and I finally received an official not interested email after 6 weeks.  J&J may be a large corporation but your recruitment process leaves a lot to be desired.   I would like my name taken out of your database and would not be interested in working for your organization.  Please do not send me any recruitment information. 
"Dear Sender,

Again l am happy to provide my feedback via this survey for J&J a well esteemed company with global outreach with great reputation. My  deep passion for working with your  great team was further reinforced by the testimonies of some friends l later got to know work with your company. 

I know it is rather extraordinary to inform candidates of specific reasons for not considering them best fit for the applied positions. It may be rewarding for some general remarks /notes for not hiring. A quicker feedback at the hiring team stage may present an improvement opportunity. My phone screening was on a Saturday, by the following Monday l received a feedback from Krista, the recruiter. This is impressive ! 

Thank you 

Sincerely

A couple of years ago, I went through part of a phone interview process that went very positive and was told I would be moved along in the process and was never given any follow up.  If the recruiter says they have no reason not to move someone along.....move them along.

Respond to candidates in a more timely fashion.  It's been months since I applied for this position.
"Currently, most recruiters rely on the ATS to score the candidates. This results in highly experienced and highly qualified candidates never selected for so much as a phone interview. My personal HR procedure is to at least visually skim a person's resume. You may see a progressive history or complementary experience that adds value and makes a brief conversation worthwhile. I have applied for multiple opportunities with J&J, and have never had a personal contact. I believe I am one of those persons who could add value if given the chance. Thank you.

I think calling to confirm receiving the e-mail, as well as asking for a personal interview would be what is expected, but if you are looking for a more creative process, through sending a video; that would entitle more effort on our side.  I think it also depends on what kind of people J&J is looking for, and maybe asking for a plan of something you expect for your recruits to do, should be executed or required of us sent to you on a certain deadline, so you actually already have something that you expect us to have, and we are somehow forced to do prior work before we earn the job.

I question whether or not my resume was even sent to the hiring manager.

"Dear Sir/Madam,

I believe the recruiter should spend at least 2 mins to understand the person caliber and at least speak to the candidate. in my 21 years of working I have recruited over 80 staff and interviewed over 500 candidates, my experience has taught me to look beyond resume to get the right candidate. In fact I got bright talent whose resume was totally misfit for the position he applied for.

"In my case, just send my cv, never passed this step of the process"
"I'm not sure it's just a Johnson & Johnson issue. The resume process as a whole in all industry has many flaws. A piece of paper with some details doesn't really give any prospective company the right information to get the best client. Depending on the job function, the best candidate is someone who probably doesn't write a resume that touts all their credentials. Many times it's the person who is less about themselves but has the mindset to see the holistic picture. In the end you have a prospective candidate that will increase your profits and brand your company.

Having said that, I have found from a job seeker, you are better to have relevant questions for any applicant to answer. Assign a value and based on responses to questions and maybe keywords in a resume to pick a prospective candidate. Keywords are subjective, as I have seen recruiters not rating similar functions into the right groups example business intelligence, market intelligence, data analytics, customer insight, customer relationship management are related and interwoven but some recruiters miss that."

Additional information as to why they reached this decision would be nice to allow me to improve upon the short comings for future opportunities.  This is how people grow within a company."
"Feedback was standard email.  I understand it would be hard to personalize, but reading 'you don't match the criteria' doesn't say anything.
I have great respect for the company and would be very interested in being part of it.  If I don`t know where my skills would fit, I may keep applying for the wrong jobs. And J&J would keep losing the opportunity of acquiring a great talent."

I have been applying to suitable open positions at J&J for over a couple of years. I never get a response. I really want to be part of the J&J family. I believe I have the skills that J&J is looking for. I would like to know what I can do differently to at least get an interview call from J&J.
Be more accesable
Call the candidate who was not selected and leave feedback.
Be more timely in responses.
"I believe that the recruiter can work on a better communication with the applicant. I applied for a function on a sunday evening and I received a message from HR on monday morning that they wil not send my resume to the department in question. I stay convinced that only a member of the Clinical Research department can decide wether or not I am suitable. I fulfilled 85% of the requirements, so I think it's strange that my resume and cover letter was blocked by HR. Maybe the research department would have decided to invite me for an interview, if they had received my application. I also think it is unfortunate that I received the mail for HR from a no-reply email, so I was not able the ask for the motivation behind their decision.

Be more present and contact the candidate.
"I have no recruitment process attended in life. I've  just applied for position and no additional communication, even if I had contacted HR recruitment stuff via Linked in. I think that the stronger communication would be some point that can make your PR and ""trust"" increased. Good luck :) "
"It would be nice to just attach a resume and answer any pertinent questions that are required to be reviewed for screening. The current process of attaching a resume and then regurgitating the information by filling out work, education and skill history is redundant and unnecessary."
"Highlight briefly why a candidate is not qualified, perhaps from a drop-down list of common reasons."
"Engagement and updates from the Talent Acquisition team were handled very well.
I would have liked to have received some feedback as to why I was not considered for interview for the role."

Tony Odell whom I interviewed with was fantastic,  and he seemed like a terrific manager to work for.

Update applicants to advise them of their status
Make an attempt to screen qualified candidates.
Keeping the applicants informed of the status of their application. 
To give feed back on application as unfortunately after my application on your site nobody gave me any notice 
I have not taken part in the recruitment process. I am very eager to join. I hope I have a chance.
"For those employees that have been with J&J for a number of years, in order to develop professionally there has to be some room for growth which currently dosent exist.  How is one to gain experience in an area of interest if they dont get the opportunity.  It seems that having the right skills or the right degrees is not what recruitment are looking for rather experience is what is being looked upon.
 "
Update the process to the candidates.
Johnson & Johnson should contact the individual.
After applying to the Recruitment Process I haven´t heard about my case until now. It will be nice to have notify candidates if they are being counted in the procedure and also being able to see the stages of the process to visualize where you are standing.
"You need to sort out the apparent gap between jobs.jnj.com and jnjc.taleo.net. Why are documents that I upload via jobs.jnj.com not available to the HR representatives in your Janssen department in Schaffhausen, Switzerland?"

"The recruitment process could improve by providing feedback with the applicants about their status of their application. 
Thank You."
To contact me to explain why i didnt get the job
Explain why a candidate wasn't a good fit for the position and ways the candidate could improve to possibly get a future position at the company. 
"In case, I was eliminated in the initial process, I think by the electronic system, so I could not have a conversation with the recruiter. I understand the need for this selection, but I think if I had the opportunity to face a person I would have done very well. But anyway, I'll keep trying."
I applied in your portal but never contact by a recruiter
I applied for the position on-line and no one contacted me regarding this job.
"My experience in the recruitment process for the Healthy Essentials Director position was suboptimal. I was not contacted by the recruiter at all, and received the ""Don't be Discouraged"" email 6 months after I posted for the position. This happened while I'd absorbed the responsibilities of the director in my role as Senior Brand Manager of Healthy Essentials."
Technically simplify the application form.
"Dear Sirs,

In my point of view in the begining, the recruitment process, is excelent, however it could be a lot better If you have a chance in order to express our knowledge personaly, face to face with the recriter.

Sincerelly,

Have a recruiter speak with me. 
"I think the calls are important, even more important that formal e-mails.

"la seule chose c'est au moins donner une réponse ou bien la raison dont je n'ai pas été recrutée.

Maybe do not dismiss candidates that do not have 100% criteria match so readily. There is a lot of talent out in the world and rarely does every external candidate fit 100%
"Since I have not been contacted by Johnson & Johnson for any reason except to fill out this survey, it would be helpful if prospective employees would get at least a courtesy of a feedback after they go through a lengthy application process."
Be more transparent and communicate better
Make it less robotic.
"Explain me the reason why I do not fit the recuitment process.
Tell me how can I improve my capacities and habilities to join your team for the indicated position.

No matters about my privacy; I'm Pablo Herrero Puert, from SPAIN and I hope being helpful for the key facts of the survey.

Call the candidates who ask to answer a survey. Only candidates who have been participated in process can have an opinion about it...
I was never interviewed....not sure why I am receiving this survey
"All de process is done for e-mail and believe that is good, because is faster.
I think should have less answers standard, explaining the reason od not to be recruited, but is requer much time and people to a work without profit."
There are many of us who have the capacity to learn and give our best to fill various vacancies that the company offers. The company should give a chance to these people who just want a chance to show they deserve the job.
"Information. I applied via corporate website. Then more then 4 week of silence. After that I received during one day 3 mails with a kind request to share my feedback about the recruitment process. :-)

I do think that collecting this feedback to improve J&J NPS is a good idea.

"At least, they can provide Feedback about my application.
If my application will not in process by company, I may know that I am not fit. "
Provide feedback regarding the reasons why i have no interview at least to introduce myself and my motivations to join your company with such a profile fitting 100 % your needs.
"Some people are mabybe not just familiar with your process of candidates screening, he failed the process, it does not mean he just can not fit for your company, that being said, it is always better to provide a reason why you reject a person, so that person can not only improve or if he disagrees, there is always a room for feedback.  "
No me contactaron nunca.
"That would be great to get decisions concerning applications a bit faster (for example, I applied for the vacancy 2 month ago and still haven't got any answers)"
I was not and never been contacted by any personal for my candidature. 
-
Sending immediate feedback to applicants
It will be much better to communicate with more detailed feedback not the typical explanation.
Actually contact the people who are bothering to apply to the jobs.  You will never get a score above 0 unless you actually respond - in any way - to an application submission.
Actually contact people to provide them with some feedback and an update
Actually contact people and provide them with feedback and the status of their application - I have had no contact from J&J
Take it more to a personal level.
Given that most things today seem to be electronic it is very hard to understand why the application wasn't suitable and it would be nice to have specific feedback on what was missing from my profile.
Request timely feedback
Have a better process & transparency.
Improve feedback after the first interview
"Provide feedback on the results of the process, even if it is negative."
Better and faster communication to talents. 
Show some courtesy and respect for applicants and communicate why they were not looked at. 
I have a lot of experience yet I feel like I was overlooked.  (probably because I don't know someone in the company.)
Being proactive
"Should inform the candidate about the status of the position for which he/she has been applied for, like other companies."
Easier application process access and a personalized letter or phone call to communicate the company desicion.
Will appreciate a mail communication to notify that candidate is considered or rejected.
"Make a call or an interview, let you a better vission "
Atleast call the candidate and inform him
Try to contact candidates and indicate the reasons why they are not a good fit for the position they applied to... or indicate them at least that the cv was received and revised. thanks
I consider it good
That is transparent.
"Having applied with a past indication of good candidate profile, I am not certain as to why a recruiter does not reply. I have phoned and left a message to indicate my interest. Johnson & Johnson are still a most desirable company and I wish to be able to continue to apply for roles."
"It's difficult for me to respond to this given that my involvement in the recruitment process has been limited.  In terms of the employment application process, I believe that the job postings clearly establish the expectations and standards for the positions I've reviewed, and the online application process is user-friendly.  "
Anything 
get in touch with candidates to provide a progressive feedback
I had a phone interview and the follow up was that the position and hiring process had been canceled. 
Provide travel and overnight accommodations when travel is &gt;200 miles from one's home. Any reasonable company should not expect a candidate to drive 6 hours in the morning before an interview in a snow storm!! 
You should contact candidates before sending this survey. I was never contacted by the recruiter. 
"Have more timely and/or consistent communication.  
With the exception of being asked to take this survey, the communication was poor and inconsistent."
"I appreciate receiving a response and understand it would be quite difficult to individualize responses; however, the response is so generic. I wouldn't know what I would need to do to improve my chances of being employed with J&J. 

Thanks,
Susan Johnson"
It's important to give a feed back about the process.
"Maybe, J&J could be review the response time between each interview according to the recruiting process."
"I would like to know, what additional things can I provide that would prompt a live interview with someone?"
Have an interview with the personal. This is a help to improve the recruiment process for a company.   
"Have a process, speak to the candidates, provide feedback, don't just send a rejection email"
N/A
N/A
More interactive and fast processing. Not just relying on the internet for its initial processes.
"I would recommend not sending a survey if there was no recruiter involved. I am a previous employee of J&J, left on great terms, and was not contacted live by anyone for this particular opportunity (keeping in mind that I was a hiring manager, and can remember the plethora of applications we received). Otherwise, the application process was fine - just no follow-up by a human."
"I would have loved to discuss the position with a recruiter, never received a phone call and feel my background is very relevant"
"I was more than qualified for the position(s) that I have applied for, but have never received any communication from J&J nor the recruiter. I've been turned down for EVERY position that I have applied for in the past 2 years, even though I have over 18 years of experience in regards to the position(s) that I have applied for."
"Have a human contact applicants! We spend a LOT of time filling out applications. Getting an automated, ""you don't fit..."" just isn't OK."
"I applied for the GOLD program 2017. During the recruitment process Manuela Manni, Talent Acquisition Partner in Johnson & Johnson, she notified everything almost immediately. However, I got until the plant manager phase and when I did not pass through the next step I asked for a feedback I did get any. I just recieved an email weeks later in german, dont know why in that language, because we communicate in english, saying they can not give personal feedback.
I know that because the large amount of applicants is difficult to give individual feedbacks. But if i got into the third phase and I am really interested into the graduate program I would like to know what do I have to improve to be proper candidate for the vacancy."
"I am sent jobs all the time via linked in and then when i decide to apply, i never hear anything until i get an email like this.. not the best experience. If I'm not a good fit, why reach out to me?"
"More explanetion for the vacancy no acepted........ what else need it to get into this beatuil company..... 
Thank you....."
"-first of wall, repair Johnson's own site for internal collaborators indications;
-give feedback after 30 or more days after the first interews."
"I really have not been interviewed, I do not understand why they did this survey because they have not called me to talk to anything related to the job.
I really hope you can solve this problem beacause I really would like to be interviewed by your work team."
It would be good to get notification that you were considered and wasn't a good fit.
Tou les personne on le doit à um entretien.
No one reached out to me.  Not sure why I received this survey?
"Give a feedback on why candidate was not selected, so candidate can improve his/her skills."
"I really think that Johnson & Johnson recruitment process is far away better than the others companies, the process take exactly the time which the recruiter informed, for this reason i can not tell you i specific detail which i would change."
"Recruiting manager should be in touch with candidate and conduct the interview
on a timely manner. This would help to increase the productivity of the company, so that both will get benefited."
More communication during the entire process
More detailed feedback. Quicker response between application and closing date.
I guess is more easy to contact people by phone 
"Pick me!
:)"
Provide feedback on why candidate wasn't selected to move forward
contact prospective applicant re status
"Did not hear from anyone.  No contact after sending in resume and cover letter,etc.
"
"Everything..
how is it possible I have received this survey already before someone contacted me that I was not chosen?
Secondly it takes tooooo much time to get some respons from you."
Provide in-person feedback with examples of why I did not receive the position. I received an email advising that Johnson & Johnson was not pursuing my candidacy and I would have greatly appreciated a conversation with the hiring manager. 
"I would have appreciated more specific reasons why my application was not considered. This would have helped me to improve my application file and told me the areas where I can excell more.
I still hold J&J as a highly recommended employer."
"Provide feedback. I was not contacted after submission of my application, until now!"
Would be good for HR to inform applicant of status 2 weeks after application.
I was never contacted by the recruiter. 
"I was impressed with the enrollment process in that the application was comprehensive and easy to move through. I also appreciated that I was notified when I was not selected as this is extremely rare and does allow for closure in the process.  I understand that a phone call or personal email is not practical due to the large volume of applicants that I am sure your receive but would be highly appreciated whenever possible. Thank you for requesting my input.

I didnt apply for this position. 
"The low score on my viewpoint of J&J stems from the fact that i was never contacted for a phone screen or anything similar in the process, which is very frustrating given that my qualifications matched very nicely with the postings requirements.

In my opinion J&J should meet candidates to better evaluate them.
"To know the reason why somebody was not selected for the position.

"The website has cookies to load which are blocked by J&J computers internally through the administrator function.  So, existing J&J employees are unable to successfully access the site and utilize drop downs appropriately. 

I also have applied for roles and can not see them in the My Next Step Section due to the loading of the cookies. 

I made the site email aware of the issue and was contacted intially but without any form of follow up or solution. 

The low favorably is reflective of the website issues and lack of contact by the recruiter. "
I never heard anything from J and J after my sending in my application. Yet I have received at least 3 surveys on how J and J is doing. Your processes need improvement.
"I applied for a position and didn't hear back for 6 months. The email simply indicated thank you for your resume but I wasn't considered given my experience. I responded back asking if there was something missing in my resume . I was simply told I didn't have a degree but everything else on my resume looked great! 
 I was very disappointed in the process.  As a J&J internal candidate , employee for 8 years ,  I feel I should have at least received a phone interview to discuss my qualifications and 25+ years experience. 
To be disqualified because of a degree, is very unfortunate. The message sent to me was I could never advance within J&J as a result despite all my other training and experience. J&J will lose exceptional talent if this is the process. A degree does not guarentee leadership, talent or skill. 
"
If the candidate is not fit the position then maybe just send the automatic mail to tell candidate and leave a contact to let the candidate ask why they are not chosen. This is win-win situation. J&J gets good reputation and the candidate also more clear the policy or the needs of J&J.
"Not sure, however, I understand that recruiters may be overwhelmed by the amount of applications received, daily."
Hire me;)
"Send an e-mail if the candidate for this position has been already decided. Thank you.

"Hello,
I was not contacted by recruiter. So, I think that this survey does not apply to me. However, I would like to take this opportunity to inform that I have tried for a long time to be part of a selection process in Brazil/ São José dos Campos and I was never contacted. I have applied to many positions, however, I have never received the return from Johnson&Johnson. I would appreciate if you can give me some recommendation. I still would like to have a chance to be part of a selection process at J&J in Brazil / São José dos Campos -SP.
Many thanks and kind regards, Daniela Dantas"
"I´d like to suggest some questions regarding the job offer, in way to help candidates to  show their experience and knowledge regarding the function requests."
J&J recruitment could follow up on job status to let the applicant know whether or not they have been selected for the interview process or not.   I never heard back after I applied for 2 positions.
"Make the process less secretive and cold.  State what the process entails, the status and some reasoning, which may be generic, for not pursuing candidates further; i.e., numerous Ivy-League responders with much more relevant experience, hired in-house, spelling errors in your resume, etc."
"By providing feedback on the decision taken, example I applied for a job and qualified for all the requirements needed for that position and never taken under consideration ( Requirements listed on the job description) "
"nothing to say, to me it's a very good company"
"Acutally contacting candidates - especially those that are internal like myself - is a good start.  I learn that I am not being considered for roles from surveys like this more often than not.  Though I have recommended individuals for roles within the company, this process is really making me reconsider whether I should continue to do so."

Phone screening would have been appreciated - my qualifications match up ideally to position requirements so further explanation as to why no phone interview would have been welcomed. Thank you for the chance to provide feedback in this matter. 
"provide feedback, a reason why I'm not a good fit for the position I applied"
Personal Contact...could be a good start.
"Johnson & Johnson companies were high on my target employer list.  If no one contacts the applicant, how can we rate J&J highly as a prospective employer?"
"I never received any contact from any recruiter.
Just one automatic email! "
"Still haven't received my reimbursement check for expenses incurred in the interview process. It's been almost 2 months!
Second, I received a letter stating was not the candidate before I received a phone call from the hiring manager. Pretty poor form!
The hiring manager was a great guy I would work for any day. The interview process sucked!"
Make contact with the candidates and provide feedback.
Faster answers and give a status on the recruitment..
"Johnson didnt even give an answer to my application.

Not a single word which is unfair to the applicant.

A one senctence refusal message would be nice."
"Oh! This is so hard! Let me take a stab at it. With possibly hundreds if not thousands of applicants applying for each open position, it would be counter-productive to have a recruiter contact each one. However, a timely response of under 14 days to receive a notification of ""still under consideration"" or ""your qualifications, while commendable, are not a proper fit for this position - thank you for your interest"" would be an improvement. 
I worked tirelessly and earned high commendations for my years as an office-based/hospital specialty representative with Janssen Pharmaceutica. I applied the skills I gained in sales/communication to my role as a homeschool educator. I had a son with severe asthma who could not benefit from the traditional school system due to repeated hospitalizations at an early age. I was forced to make the choice to stay home with my son to give his lungs proper time to heal. At the time, as a hospital specialty-rep in Seattle, WA, I was on the fast track to securing a position as a sales manager. Choices force change. 
Sixteen years later, I am sending my third child off to college. All three of my children will be enrolled at universities this Fall. All three received academic scholarships. Certainly, my organizational skills and drive for excellence I applied as a specialty representative impacted their successes. Foremost, I believe my unique ability of discernment, analyzing strengths in learning styles, and applying those in all modes of academic discipline played a major role. Ironically, those same skills I have honed while homeschooling would promote a unique advantage as a sales manager.
Many hats have been worn these past 16 years, it's hard to capture on a resume the vast experiences I've gained. Listing speech/debate coach, creating my own website for an English Literature class I've run for the past 8 years (www.wordlyways.com), founding and running a successful scouting troop, co-founding an educational co-operative that has grown from 60 students to over 250 in 2 years focusing on college-prep courses, speaking before the Senate Education Committee in Alabama's state court to promote the Tim Tebow bill, training horses and providing outlets for foster children in need - each of these share a snippet of my qualifications/drive. However, simply putting ""homeschool mom"" on a field does not quantify the roles and responsibilities adequately.
I may be at a disadvantage having left the corporate field 16 years ago, but the courses I have traveled, the leaders I have met and engaged with only spur my desire to share my knowledge and skills with the next generation of sales agents. I have excelled at motivating and encouraging, spurring on my 'charges' to excellence and utilizing every available resource.
I would hope a recruiter might be able to read through the resume, make that phone call to candidates such as myself, and be surprised by the vision and commitment behind the online form. Does that answer the question?"
Candidate should be contacted and should be given proper response in either case of selection or rejection.
"Conduct interviews in a timely manner - I applied to a position about 4+ months before I got an initial HR screening call.  I almost forgot the position I applied to, it was so long between applying and hearing anything.  Also, it would be nice to get a phone call or more detailed email explaining why a person was not considered for the position."
"I am a highly qualified candidate with knowledge of your Total Joint line.
No interest, no call backs, no interviews?
Call me and set an appointment... I will evn consider part time 1099?"
Give some reason why not qualified  for the opportunity
"The way you can improve the recruitment process is making a deep check to the prospective employee skills and giving a clear ""next step"", in that way, the recruiter is not the only person interested. "
"I was able to speak with the hiring manager (VP) in a phone interview.  While I would have appreciated getting to the next level with an in-person interview, I understand my leadership profile wasn't an ideal match for the Sr. Director position.  

Admittedly, I was disappointed not to have had the chance to be part of the in-person interview process.  I am confident my leadership experience and extensive capabilities and expertise in the commercial environment would have been more apparent with added verbal/non-verbal context beyond a phone screen.

I remain highly interested in Johnson & Johnson.  Thank you for your willingness to receive feedback of the recruitment & interview process.  The recruitment team was excellent and a pleasure to work with.

I am highly qualified for this position and was not even contacted regarding my resume. Make contact with qualified candidates.
Notifying candidates whether they have been moved forward.
"
The recruitment process should be clearer.  Furthermore, no job interview should be held unless a position is opened clearly. Candidates should be informed of the net result after the job interview has been held. A return as if the position was closed, does not fit into a company of this size."
Give updates with applications.
"It took a few months before I heard anything from J&J and I could not contact the recruiters in any way. It made me doubt that my application did not reach the right person.
After a few months, I received a standard email that I was not selected. This was a standard email, no indication why I was not selected and no possibility to contact someone to receive more information.  
I am still interested to know why my profile does not meet the expectations to go to a second round, thus I would be very grateful to speak to someone from J&J because I can possibly learn from the feedback I would get. My phone number is +32477398937. 
Looking back to the process so far, I fear that I will not get response to the feedback I am giving, however, I hope that I am wrong this time.

"Need to train the recruiters all the time and provide refresh trainings over and over again.

They are terrible to provide feedback, to reply external messages and to communicate with candidates. Timing and prompt responses are their weeknesses.

In this specific hiring process, recruiter sent me out a message asking to fullfil a form with personal sata. I sent her on the following day and after that she simply disappeared. During 02 or 03 months I've often sent her a message asking for a feedback but she always ignored my messages. I never got any response. The worst process ever which I had with J&J."

In this specific hiring process, recruiter said me they would consider me for the next phase after new years eve. After one month, I sent him an e-mail asking for further information and then on the same day, I received an automatic message thanking me for the participartion. Conclusion: He forgot about providing a feedback for me and only remebered after receiving my follow up e-mail.

"If managing time and juggling the unexpected is part of the recruitment evaluation then the short (1day) notice for interviews makes sense.  

Otherwise, role modeling respectful planning would be more attractive to potential candidates like myself.

Thank-you for the opportunity."
Communication with the applicant is key.
It's important to provide a feedback. I never got one about the process
"I have had phone interviews for maybe 6 to 8 different positions over the past 2-3 years.  I don't recall any instance where someone followed up with me to advise I hadn't moved on.  Each time I followed up with the HR contact to be  advised my candidacy hadn't moved forward.  I wasn't given any feedback regarding my interview or successful candidate so there's no point in advising people to the Talent Community if they aren't given any feedback to make them better candidates. 

I have heard good things about J&J as a company and have no doubt its a good place to work when you're employed there.  For potential candidates like myself, its not the best experience to continously interview there and have to chase people down for updates and feedback which has been my experience.  "
It would be nice to receive some notice that the position was filled. I received no information other than looking on JJEDS and seeing a person with the job description title was now listed under the hiring manager.   Also there was a 2nd position open which I am not sure if I am being considered for or will need to go through the interview process again or if that position was also filled.  Its disappointing being a J&J employee that you aren't even given the courtesy of an email saying the position was filled after completing several interviews. Its known that the process moves slowly but getting no response or update just leaves you wondering if it was filled or are they still interviewing?
Better feedback and unless a personal contact. Nobody contacted me anytime.
No one every personal contacted me. I received an email the position was filled.
" I was told that I would get a phone screen since I was an internal referral. That did not happen.  I did not receive any contact from J&J except when I got not one, but two rejection emails."
I understand the first person in the recruiting process has to filter out candidates. But my experience and capability go far beyond what can be read by a scan of a resume. You missed an opportunity with my candidacy. Whomever you moved forward with may be excellent. But not giving me a 30 minute phone screen was a missed opportunity.
"An e-mail is not contacting someone to tell them they where not a fit.  Spell out why I was not a fit as I could have left something out that might have been a deciding point.   Also look outside the box, maybe no ""specific"" industry experience but allot of channel experience for this role could have been an asset.  "
"Las plataformas de reclutamiento por internet son muy distantes e impersonales, y la evaluacion solo se basa en datos puntuales de la Hoja de vida, cuando el candidato posee mas que experiencia, actitudes y aptitudes para ofrecer a una vacante"
I would like to know the reason why I am not a good fit for the position I've applied for.
It was a very friendly and pleasant Interview - Thank you very much
"It would be useful to have some specific feedback, rather than ""We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Commercial Director - North (1600131748W) at Johnson & Johnson Medical Ltd. - fka -Ethicon Ltd."" Ideally it would be good to speak to someone to understand why my background and experience were not suitable. "
I am a displaced employee with over 21 years of experience.  I explained by situation to the recruiter via e-mail and voice message.  I did not even get a response.  Extremely disappointed in the process and lack of communication by Ray Barber.  
"Bonjour, 

N'ayant pas eu de retour de ma candidature, je ne peux pas répondre à votre questionnaire."
"I am a displaced employee with over 21  years of tenure with J&J.  I sent e=mails and left voice messages for the recruiter and did not even get a phone screen for this position.  Thereafter, I was informed that an ""internal candidate"" had been identified for the position.  No additional feedback has been provided thereafter. Extremely disappointed in the process.  "
"Provide feedback in terms of where the application is in the process
Also provide feedback in the event the candidate was not successful and reasons why?"
Be more detailed about reasons which takes not to choose a candidate
"Talk to the candidates to learn more about their professional qualifications verses scanning resume through a automated system. Remember, people sell to the customers. "
Communicate in some way with the applicants

Good Morning
Attached copy of mail how I support my participation in the selection process in 2016 for the South zone. Passing all the stages of the same and arriving at the final interview in which I called a lot of attention that the interviewers did not have my CV, therefore and given my experience that interview was only PROTOCOL. The person was already selected, I have 8 years of work and I found it unworthy and disrespectful. You went to me to consult and I answered you with the truth. THAT SHOULD NEVER BE LESS THAN A LARGE COMPANY HOW J & J. Until today I think it was this Head of Line.

"
Give the candidate with a good CV at least the opportunity of a phone interview at least!!
"Provide feedback as to why applications were not moved forward.
Allow acceptable time to review application."
When you get zero feedback after taking the time to apply for a position and get the very un-personal thanks but no thanks and that is if you hear at all. The application process seems to screen out candidates without a person ever seeing the candidates qualification through a few computerized question.  
"I was never contacted for an interview.
This survey makes absolutely non sense.
Regards."
"I have not been contacted for the recruitment process. WHY am I receiving survey?

Please review my resume', as I am more than qualified for the Information Technology Leadership Development Program - 2017 (000015W9).

"
"I have received a survey about my application experience three times, but never heard feedback on whether I was in consideration for the positions. Do more follow up on positions and less surveys "
"I would like to work at Johnson & Johnson and maybe Johnson will need to send the e-mail about information- Why I didn't receive to invite me to join.
Thank you!"
"I can't say anything aboout de recruitment process. I didn't get contacted by any recruiter for a interview.
But I have friends that work at JnJ and they say that is a great company to work."
"Although I applied to several positions I have not heard back from any recruiters or have been invited to complete the interview process, therefore I cannot really comment on this survey with honesty. "
I am a current employee and I haven't received feedback from HR yet. 
"I have applied for a few positions to which I believe I was qualified. Based on my resume, I continue to receive job announcements yet have not been able to speak to anyone about my qualifications. I would like to speak with someone from HR or your talent acquisition unit to understand better what I lack in skills.  Thank you."
"I get really disappointed in the recruitment process because the recruitment was for a training and I had all necessary qualifications and skills required, so it was very disappointing to receive an email just saying that Johnson & Johnson choose not to continue with my application with no reason why, and without an interview in person. If I had not the right profile to the training I would understand, but I had all requires skills and qualifications, so I would expect at least some questions about me and an interview in person. I was really excited with this recruitment but it just turned to be disappointing and I'm sad about that, because I had Johnson & Johnson like an excellent pharmaceutical company to work, but after all maybe you didn't pay attention to all candidates. I really hope next time you take some more time to know the people behind the cv's. Thank you"
It would have been nice to receive a more personalised and constructive feedback on the reasons to reject my application. With no feedback there is no room for improvement. 
Improve communication with candidates.  Today does not exist.
"May be more (or better) contact with the candidates, just a littlem more personalizated email or something like that."
I applied for the job a week back and no body contacted me accept i got a survey link.
"N/A
I was only extended a phone screen by the recruiter.  An on site interview was not offered.  However, the recruiter did explain that their were a couple strong internal candidates.  This information was valuable.
thank you."
Any notifications regarding the application process would be great.  i didn't even hear anything about this one at all.
"Penso que a Johnson & Johnson é uma das  melhores empresas para o colaborador atuar.
I think Johnson & Johnson is one of the best companies for the employee to act."
"I wish I can say timely notification but at this point, 'any' notification would be great."
"I only received this email with the survey so I didnt received any information if I will receive the new contact to the company to avanced to the future interview
rgds
I hope the Jhonson&Jhonson contact me because I hope and I want to work there"
"I worked as Quality Inspector at Embraer S.A. for 9 years certifying the correct process of machining, stamping and assembly of sub-assemblies of parts in composite and aluminum as well as certification of dynamic tests and assemblies of avionics systems.
I worked in the Santa Casa de Misericórdia Hospital in São José dos Campos - SP as a maintenance technician where it was necessary to certify the correct functioning of the surgical instruments.
I undertook an engineering internship at the Swissbras injection molding and plastic molding company where I cataloged all the polymers to be placed in the machines and made process control charts for the Quality sector to ensure that the best process guaranteed more quality parts."
I never received a call.  I have a very poor impression of Johnson and Johnson. Not quite sure of the integrity of the company if this is your process.  
Brindarnos mas posibilidades en la entrevista y darnos la oportunidad de hablar directamente con recursos humanos.  
Worse place to apply for jobs. Not sure if there are any recruiters working.  Get response after 6 months. Never came across company that is so slow. Not sure if it's laziness or recruiters don't care. Will lose lot of good people. Need to get rid of workforce management altogether If no one bothers to respond. Never applying again.
"I was a great fit for the position I applied for, certainly worthy of a follow up contact and an initial conversation.  Instead, I never heard from J&J's recruiter after reaching out multiple times, as well as contacting a recruiter with a direct message on LinkedIn.  

A missed opportunity for J&J, for sure. 

Chris Long"
It would be good to receive feedback about the reason(s) why I wasen't selected.
"Work with applicants to understand their value add, be candid about whether they perceive their is a potential fit and anticipated timing.

Thanks for sending survey."
"There should be fair process based on the education & experiences. I have been trying for the last 12 years to join J &J but never got invited even at once to appear for an interview. Look forward and I will keep applying as I have keen interest in joining J &J.

Thanks

"The commmunication about the process is so importan and for that reason maybe you can give the status of that,while the process is open. When I received the call we accordanced an appointment. Due to internet conections the firts interview vía Skype  wasn't posible, then once again the company agent for HR contact me but this time sent me a link for an special platform. I was conected from 10 minutes before, but the person never was connected. Until nowadays never received an status about the process selection."
all candidates should receive feedback as to why they were not selected especially if they go through the interview process.  This will help improve the overall talent within J&J
"I think Johnson & Johnson recruitment process should give more chances for the canditates to show what they really are as employee. Sometimes cv is not enought to show that, so I suggest make more personal interviews.

"I was NEVER contacted by a recruiter for the position I applied for with your company.   This survey is to help your process how?  When the process was not fulfilled.  I was very disappointed with your process and per the requirements I AM qualified so I believe this survey is a waste of your time but I appreciate you allowing me to express my views on your ""process""."
I have not had any correspondence from a recruiter.
Feedback to the candidate on the selection process.
Provide feedback if or notify that the position has closed.
Fornecer mais oportunidades para que o candidato possa efetivamente concorrer a vaga.
"Some level of personal interaction, especially for a senior executive posting, should be de minimus.  The with the slightest review of either my CV or my public profile, it is obvious that I am both a J&J Alumnus and led a preferred consulting partner's (PA Consulting Group) J&J account team.  If you are not going to make that effort on executive level postings, then do not post them in public boards."
"I would appreciate constructive feedback on my application and recommendations on how to become a better candidate in the future for Johnson & Johnson. Also, a reason for being rejected would be wonderful to receive as I should know what to improve. "
Clearly show the requirements for each position and do not add requirements once postulated
"I was sent this survey, but other than my sending my resume in to your team for review I have not received any contact from your team except for this survey.  I would be unfair for me to have an input on this as I did not go through any screening or discussions with your team."
"Actually respond to potential candidates. I did get an electronic acknowledgement that my application had been received, but nothing else.
Is the position still open? Am I still a viable candidate? Should I forget J&J and move on to searching for other opportunities with other companies?"
"How about contacting me about the 2 Synthes job openings here in the area that I am extremely qualified for? That would be a good start. One of the positions has been open since August, I have good relationships with the doctors involved and I know the hiring manager who tells me that his hands are tied until he gets my recommendation from the recruiter."
I don't receive a feedback from the process
"Phone screen all applicants, interview qualified people.
My strong suit is the interview, once interviewed, I'm offered positions, every time, if I feel it is the right fit  for me, ill except."
"To Whom It May Concern (Hopefully the head of recruiting)
You send an email asking for feedback on the interview/recruiting process to a highly qualified prospective candidate whom you never even had a phone interview with? Its apparent your process is disconnected. I wonder how many other highly qualified candidates are being overlooked......"
"Applying for a career opportunity with a Fortune 100 company is extremely important to a qualified candidate. To be kept in the dark about next steps is unacceptable. At least...let the candidate know if the company has an interest. I am well qualified for the position of which I applied and I have gotten no response from J&J; so I STILL don't know if I'm being considered or not. But I can receive  correspondence to ""take a survey."" "
Plus de communication. une meilleure lecture des CV.
"I only received confirmation of the resume submiting , nothing else about the position."
Recruiters should be trained to do their job unbiassed
"If you were more personaly, it would by fine."
Giving me a chance
At least give an interview.
I would recommend to send an email alert when any change happens on your website applications. 
At least candidate should be contacted before being rejected.
"I am not sure why I received this email as I was never contacted by any recruiter for this position.  However, I did apply and received an email stating I was not a good fit.  I do feel that I would be a good fit, though.  I have been with my current company for almost 12 years, which shows my dedication to the role I play.  I am a Senior Accountant who handles all facets of accounting, from journal entries to Financial Statement Analysis.  The only reason I am minimally looking for other opportunities is because there is no further advancement available at my current company.  I am aware that Johnson and Johnson is a top tier company and that is one of the reasons why this position would be a great fit for me.  I am extremely hard working and am in search of a position with a strong company where I can further my career.  I believe that I would be a great asset to the company. If you have any other opportunities available, you can reach out to me at keith.clevens@verizon.net.  You will be happy when you do."
"I think if you could provide feedback information of why are not able or able to vacancy, it would be great."
I was getting emails after I got the rejection letter telling me my resume was under review for the job- it was very confusing.  No feedback was given at all.
"since neither the recruiter or interviewer contacted me, don't you think you should check that fact before you send out your survey?"
"This position was for a single individual, but two people were hired. The second person should have beed required to go back through the hiring process as there was concerns of favoritism. "
Check to see if recruiter actually talked to the person before you send out your survey?
"Provide feedback on the process.
It will be good to know why you were not chosen, so for a next opportunity you know what you need to improve. "
No comment
Provide at least an automated explanation why a qualified person does not recive an interview.
Johnson & Johnson could provide more analytical feedback than the candidate needs to get the job
Give some reason why we were not a good for the position and where we can invest to fit from the opportunity.
"Basically by giving feedback about what happened. I am open to consider potential job opportunities in the future in this great company. 

Thanks!"
"Na verdade a empresa poderia investir mais em recrutamento, aumentando a produção e o quadro de funcionário."
"Before applying for the Role, I compared the Job Requirements against my own Skills and Experience, and came to the conclusion that I was a pretty good match.  Even my physical proximity to the Job Location (Schaffhausen, Switzerland) was favourable.
I was therefore disappointed that Johnson & Johnson / Cilag AG did not provide more detailed feedback (except the automated mail informing me ""that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position"").
This leaves me wondering whether my application was handled personally, or only as part of an automated process.
It also leaves me wondering why I was not suitable for the Role, and/or whether I missed something when looking at the Job Requirements."
"I only received an email stating my application was reviewed and I was not being considered as a candidate but no reason why. 
Please work with the hiring managers to agree on the searchable terms for vetting. 
My rating of the company is a rating on the company not the recruiting process. That rating would be very different."
Feedback about the application should be MUST.
Maybe if you could get back to the candidates within a week that would be good. Waiting 2 weeks is a bit too long.
 Contact people and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to
Very unpersonalised response with no feedback given as to why I was not suitable. Very disappointing
Please let the candidate know about the requirements/ expertise which company is looking for and the criteria for getting called for interview.
Transparency
"Give feedback on why I was not interviwed for the 2 positions I applied for, rather than a standard email"
No need to change.
"1&gt; Provide information on the closing date of advertised jobs. 
2&gt; Provide information concerning the timeline of the recruitment process whereby it can be clearly visible on the bottom of each individual job specification. "
"Reducing the time to confirm if you are being selected or not for the position you had appplied, after doing the interview."
Update the prospective candidates about their status of application and actually consider online applications for the job postings on the website.
"Dear Mr. Gehring, 

this is the second time I fill in the survey. As already written in my first survey I filled in about two weeks ago, I mentioned that I was a bit astonished that I did not received a hint of a reason why my candidature was rejected. In my opinion there Johnson & Johnson could improve. The candidates take some time to apply for a job with Johnson & Johnson. 

N.B. especially when you upload documents it is written up to 3 documents. In fact you only can upload one. Later you can sign in and upload a second document, but not a third. This is confusing.   

I hope my feedback is helpful. 

Best regards

"I contacted the recruiter five times and never heard back how I done, not to even let me know if I was successful or not. After the third email I finally got a reply that I would get a phone call which I never did. I was very disappointed as I would love the opportunity to work for Johnson and Johnson but dishearten about the whole process, so much so that I feel I would have a disadvantage in applying for future positions.

"I had the impression that the questions for the online interview were all very similar. Also the deadline of fulfilling the interview in the next 48 hours can possibly be enlarged, as sometimes you don't have immediately acces to ""quick"" internet for a day or two. Although, most of the time it is probably a good idea to set this deadline.
The e-mail on whether you're invited to the ""in-house day"" came only a couple of days before the day itself and almost more than a month after the online interview.
It would also be nice to provide feedback on online interview."
I did not make any interview with your company. I applied for the vacant positions but nobody get in touch with me
"Just communicate. No response to my application but 3 emails requesting feedback on my application process!!

"You should take into consideration the experience of the candidate in the topic that the job is mainly focused on.

I have the impression that the person who reviewed my CV didn't know much about the main skills required in the job description and didn't understand the relevance of my experience for that job. In other words, a more informed judgement on my experience, would make the case that I should be considered for the job.

"
More detail in the actual job description.
The complete process should become more transparent.
Simple and fast!
The recruitment process takes much to long. The recruiter should have informed me why I am not suited for the applied position 
Contact people !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Give reasons why I am not a good fit.
Process is fairly good.
find me a job in your company and i 'll tell you !!!
"The recruitment team should share correct reason for rejecting candidates.
I would like to quote one example. I was interviewed in December 2014 for the position of Manager in analytical development. My all interview rounds went good (as per my knowledge). I waited for almost 2 months for the response from recruitment team and finally I called one person with whom I was dealing. He told me that ""your candidature doesn't fit with respect to the total experience for the position"".
My questing is that, My CV was already with recruitment team and based on that they called me for face to face interview after two telephonic rounds. At site I was interviewed for three times and finally recruitment team says that ""your experience doesn't suit for the position which we are looking for"" is really not good for any candidate. 

I really would like to thanks for global team to give me a chance to share my incidence with you. I am still looking for great opportunities in Johnson and Johnson as this is my dream organization.

Thanks a lot

"I don't believe your selection process is right or your ad doesn't not match your requirements. 
 I believe I had the right skill set based on the requirements. I am surprised that no one contacted me.  "
"Please give a feedback why the application was not considered by the recruiting teams which shows the J&J esteem for the candidate. As automated the recruiting CRM might be, it is about people and personalities.  "
"- I have hardly recieved any specific feedback or call from HR Zug for all the position I applied. Only feedback was from HR Belgium for a position in Zug in 2016.

In 2012 I had an interview for a position with Mrs. Francoise Ifrah and the Hiring manager"
"1-Giving feedback about reasons for rejection will be a truly respectful way of communications .

2-Showing the ranking of each candidate with your reply can be an illustrative tool that tells the candidates where they should apply at your respectful firm .

2-Offering CV evaluation for the top 5 candidate will be something Unique that reconciles with J&J unique brand name ."
"Provide a reason why I was no good candidate, since the rejections was very fast and it seemed like a bug in the system, since the rejection e-mail was faster than the e-mail confirming my candidacy was received."
"To make sure it is not an administrative process to check the box since it challenges the validity of the process. In my case, I got the back up of 2 VPs to go for slating and to be fair there was a strong fit between the role and my experience. I was never called to interviews and after I wrote to the recruiter I got as feedback that they moved pretty fast in the hiring process and a candidate was selected. It would have been fine to not get the job if after interviews there was proper feedback about my lack of fit or need for improvement in specific areas but what I received was far from that. My conclusion was that the posting was made for administrative reasons and this just undermines the overall recuritment process, unfortunately."
Propose to the candidates to inform them about free job positions of his interests  
"I applyed several times for different job. Always got the answer: Sorry, the job is not longer availlable, because we have changed internal processes.
J&J is´nt a company I try to apply again."
Inform the candidates about the process
"Good Morning,
Personally, I just wish the process was fast, transparent and clear; fast, because a long process is tedious. Transparent, because I would like to know the rules and the process from the very first minute. Of course, understood from effective communication, knowing at any moment if my candidature continues or not.
thank you very much and best regards,"
Yet now no one contacted for the recruitment offer. Try to make sure these activities as soon as possible. 
"This is not the first role I've applied to at J&J; I have some good friends that work there and have sent my via via your recommendation programme in addition to my on-line applications. However even the simple Talent Acquisition activities I have been exposed to do not present an organised or coordinated front, for example:

1. When recommended, the role is then either no longer available or give to an internal candidate immediately after the application end date. No feedback given and only once did I recieve an automated 'you were not sucessfull' email
2. No thanking you for applying and giving some feedback as to why you were not a fit
3. Sending this questionnaire to me 3 times within 20 minutes of the first email link

I have not been asked to give feedback before so thank you for the opportunity to do so. Unfortunately I now have quite a sour taste about your recruitment process."
"Clear feedback to candidates, specially those internal applicants, since this will determine their career path with the organization.
Set right expectations, by starting with well qualified internal candidates and then move to external candidates, choose based on qualifications and historical leadership profile (I had several referrals in the global organization, none of them was consulted)"
Pls offer the feedback to those who applied to the position even though they are not the person you are looking for.
"Keep people better informed. Applying for a job is stressful enough, but when that appplication disappears into the web with no feedback, that is just rude."
"Discussion, Update opportunities, Update Social Media, Advertisements "
Hire me
I'd like to say something after conversation with recruiter
"to provide negative feedback to candidates that are no longer considered for the application process is really uncommon, most companies do not provide such a service, J&J included. I have experienced though situations (but in smaller contexts, small - medium sized companies), in which the candidate had the opportunity to reply to the rejection, and the recruiting team would actually reconsider their first judgment. "
They can be faster at the process
"Hi,
If the candidate has a profile that could potentially be a strong fit with the company, then it would be great to have a personal meeting or call?
Kind regards"
Very slow process.  Took over 6 months to get back to me to inform me that the position was filled.  
No feedback for a post I was very qualified to do. 
"Johnson & Johnson can improve the recruitment process by the experiences of the candidate as they applied in field.
Some times we didn't know new field but apply for."
more clarity in communication of why resource has not been selected
"After my application, I received within 4 hours a reply that my application has been discussed and the view is that it does not fit.

This gave me a clear insight into how the recruitment process is taking place and with standard mails the applicant is not shown the necessary respect. In 4 hours no one has examined an application and are resolved with the department. I will not apply to J & J anymore.

I work myself also in a larger enterprise and this is not a quality I would have expected. As an important Arbitgeber in Solothurn there would have to be more behind. 

Since contact person and telephone number are also missing, one can hardly be informed as applicants and clarify details regarding places.

These are my suggestions for improvement
"
its very best recruitment process for to improve the employ capability and found good knowledge 
It would be good to hear why we are not a good fit for the Job from recruiters to improve ourselves.
"A bit more personal feedback, less automated mailings."
"If the persons background experience is not what is required then that person should not have been called for interview.
The feedback could have been a lot better."
"It is very helpful when you formulate the reason well, why I do not fit for this position. A simple explanation, or wording ,, we have candidates who fit better for the position,, is very trivial and common.
To know the honest reason why I do not fit for the position gives me at least informations, so that one can improve.

Atleast contact once so that person can come to know that what is the status of their application is going on?
"I expect to have at least technical interview before take decision on the recruitment.

Decision has been done, just reviewing profile, doesn't seem to be right.."
i was never contacted - received standard inpersonnal email
I feel that J&J should create more transparency in the recruiting process informing the candidate on where they stand in this process.
"Well I used to consider Johnson & Johnson one of the very best positions in the country, but since they never took the time to acknowledge me or even email or call me about the position I applied for then I have a different view point on the organization as a whole.  Companies and corporations are getting too big and no paying attention to the people who keep them in business nor are they even bothering to reach out to all candidates to see if they are a great fit for a position with their company.  I am very disappointed in the way the recruitment for this position has been handled.  I hope that an executive decides to read this and start a new hiring process.  A process that only involves a couple of people and not an entire staff to make a decision.  It doesn't take 3 or more interviews to find a great fit.  It should consist of 1 to 2 interviews max.  Thank you for your time."
I am still very interested in joining the J&J team to help improve people's lives. And I realize that I can add value to the organization and I hope I be given the chance to showcase what I can bring to the organization.
"face to face
"
I haven't yet experience the recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson but I believe they have a process that is not bias.
"At this moment, I have nothing to add."
"Honestly, 
I am about tasks.
Give me a task and allow me to shine through them, then judge me. 
Having been in business myself, I truly do not know how you can find great staff if you can not see what they are capable of. I am sure allot of good staff are identified and many are pouched from other means.

I'm not talking about self assessments. The ones that establish, what are you good at or bad at. 
C-mon who really sits down and does that?
Throw out a question and or a scenario, allow us the recruits to answer it the best way possible and pick those who meets your:
A) organisations goals  
B) The departments goals
C) Company culture?
D) The departments culture?

Take me for instance, Have been in the corporate world, jumped into another industry totally foreign and was successful for a while. Almost went bankrupt ( on my last $1000.00), hand to sell assets to stay in the game, but didn't give up. Stayed and ran with what I had and remoulded the business to gain enormous benefits for me and my family.
Does this tell you something?
Maybe not?

Anyway, good luck.

I love how your organisation reflects (through these actions/methods).

I have not sold in hospital sales; however, I know I would excel and exceed expectations as I have done in every facet of my professional and personal career.  Feel free to reach out to other J&J employees I've worked closely with: Denise Sena (Former Merck colleague) and Yury Gomez (MBA Classmate). Best wishes, with finding the right candidate. "

Treat people like we mean something.

Improve the communication with candidates. The lack of information is something horrible to people that are applying for a job.

"Was not contacted by a recruiter at any point. I received acknowledgement of my application via an automated email and that was the last I heard until this survey. (one of many surveys that I've received over the past few months for positions where I applied and received no followup or contact)

You could improve the process by correlating the surveys with people who were contacted. Gathering this information from people who were not considered or contacted will almost certainly skew your data. "

I used to work at J&J filling in for a maternity contract.  I applied for two jobs and didn't hear back from one at all.  It would of been nice to be contacted even if I was not successful.
See answers to above questions. The slightest effort to communicate would have been appreciated!?
Kindly provide a process by which applicants would get an honest feedback specifically on the status of their applications. Thank you!
Please keep the candidate up to date on the progress.
"Recruitment process seems quite appropriate. However, zero contact in my case got me with questions to improve in my job search.
Perhaps volume of applications makes impossible to reach all applicants, but that affects your ability to give/receive feedback.
Johnson & Johnson´s very good image for outsiders does not match with the poor applicants´experience.
Perhaps process improvement trough technology can help you manage volume and response."
Faster response
No one contacted me and I haven't hear anything from J&J
"I believe my experience in pharmaceutical sales was over looked, and not even receiving a phone call for an interview was extremely discouraging."
Maybe give a reason why I am not a good fit for a job position.
"There was no contact regarding interview process, or feedback as a result of my employment application, it appears I was not successful in proceeding to interview, however some feedback relating to my application would have been professional on the part of J&J.

The only communication I have received is the request to complete this survey, a very disappointing outcome."
I have applied for several positions with JnJ in Singapore and other countries for the supply chain / logistics / projects related positions. However I am repeatedly getting automated messages stating that my application is not successful each time! Why cant the hiring team call the candidates with right profile and experience for an interview and find out what they can deliver or find out directly on their capabilities? I am a qualified supply chain / SAP / logistics professional with 16+ years of experience and holds an MBA & Engineering degrees.I am still waiting for an interview with the direct hiring line manager after sending more than 30 applications to JnJ for the last 1 year. It looks like the direct applicants via JnJ career website is not getting interview calls when compared with candidates applying thru the career agents!
"Treat the candidates with respect.  Don't forget that you're not the only one conducting interviews. The candidates are interviewing you and your company as well.  In my case, Johnson & Johnson failed miserably.   I was 100% qualified for the few positions I applied for and yet I was never given a reason why I was not picked.  For the only interview that I was given, I sat inside a small room next to the front door.  You didn't even have enough respect to bring me inside and conduct the interview in a conference room.  And when I was rejected, I wasn't even notified that I wasn't picked.  I had to contact the hiring manager to get an update.  For a company as large as J&J, you have a lot to learn to be professionally in the same level as the other fortune 500 companies."
"J&J can improve the recruitment process if:
* someone will monitor the system who are the possible candidates, then right there and then they can get an update whether if they have schedule for interview or none.
* J&J can also send sms update to all candidates the moment they are successfully apply in any position posted at the website."
"It would be nice to have a more personalized interaction, as I am still very interested in joining this team for its commitment to innovation, quality and excellence."
I would appreciate to have initial discussion with me to understand about me before making any decision. I will provide better perspective about me.
Send a feedback when candidate doesn't meet the position requirements.
Provide feedback with regards to not being selected for next steps.
I understand every applicat for a position cannot be contacted but I strongly feel current JNJ employees should be contacted regardless of whether they are moved forward in the process.. 
Stop sending this emails! 
I am extremely concerned that my candidacy was not seriously considered because of my age. If I am correct that is an unfortunate commentary on the Human Resources component of one of the finest corporations in the country. While my credentials at very least justified affording me an opportunity to be heard by way of an interview I was summarily rejected. I do not believe that process represents an enlightened approach. 
Let the candidates know how the recruitment process is going. And communicate either if the candidate continues to the next phase of recruitment or if they are excluded.
Surprised I did not hear anything from the recruiter. I do have years of experience
The recruitment process is great. Hopefully there is a job for me as a Registered Nurse. Thank You.

"Having applied (not yet successfully) to a number of J&J positions, I'd say that J&J is better than most at notifying applicants of status and position closure. Per my personal records (and allowing that I may have missed updating something) I have at least heard from J&J on 8 of the 12 applications I've submitted across several businesses (i.e. Janssen, CP, Ethicon, etc). I did not record that I was notified on this particular position (6327160602, applied Sept. 12, '16), but as I said I might have missed that notification. "

"Be more selective of the recruitment companies you choose to represent you in the future- G2 Healthcare- very poor candidate experience - consistently had to badger to get any follow up, this experience was typical for another post they sent me for with J & J 6-7 years ago- they sent me then at the wrong time. Your telephone interview worked well & your lady was very charming. However it then took weeks to organise an interview, which was cancelled then rescheduled. The interviewers were very pleasant but somewhat robotic in their questions & approach - as I was the last interview of the day- they had probably given up the will to live at this point! It would have been good to get some feedback , I pursued this through G2 - but never got a response. Perhaps your department should take more ownership of relaying this information back in a more timely manner. Overall - J & J are an attractive company to work for but do appear to take a long time to react- I don't feel this fits your core credo value of treating potential employees with respect & value- I had rushed a long way from an appointment & researched the position well- I walked away still not feeling as though I had any idea of what the job entailed. At times I felt uncomfortable during the interview with the intimacy between manager & co-worker- it's good to show mutual respect for each other however I felt the manager was a little to overboard which came across as a bit insincere."
Interview candidates before you blanketly decided the candidate was suitable or not. In my experience I have years of experience on payroll - got a new job after a week not even called for an interview

"I know that most of the recruitment is filtered via software that utilizes key word searches....I think that it may be useful in some instances, however you do miss out on highly skilled sales representatives. A career path of a salesperson can take you down avenues that you would never have fathomed at times. I began in the copy machine industry like many reps, then technology selling computer service, then a brief hire with US Surgical (which I leave off the resume....I passed their grueling 6 weeks training program that only 20% pass in CT, but had to quit when there was a death in the family). After this, I ended up at Allied Waste (quite a change in careers....yet very lucrative). My point is,....you would never guess that someone who's past 10 years of sales is comprised of Waste Sales, then Fuel sales and now selling Semi Trucks to fleets would be someone highly qualified and very well suited for a career at J&J (who was US Surgical's largest competitor in laparoscopic surgical instrumentation). I would re-evaluate your  screening process due to the fact that every time I've applied I get an automatically generated form letter telling me I'm not what you're looking for. I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that I exactly the type of rep you would dream of having.....confident, honest, accurate, diligent and driven. I have been top in the top 5% in sales in a $7 Billion dollar/year industry, Top sales in a regional fuel sales company for overall profit and profit margin.....yet I'm most likely viewed blindly as someone who is suited for blue collar sales (which is far from what I am limited to). Those are my thought, experience and advice for you moving forward. The old adage ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" holds very true in this instance. 
Best of luck with recruiting....you have a great company....hope to see you improve.

ok
please let the candidate know why he/she is not fir for the job

Make efficient test for the candidates to find the right employee to the right position
Contact interviewees as soon as reasonably possible.  My application was submitted over 12 months ago.  There was no communication with me until the position was cancelled.   
Give chance to people without experience to get their first job
It can be improved by making it less automatic. I understand that the company finds easily a pool of talents given the strong brand and good reputation but it will be nice to be contacted sometimes by the recruiter to know the why and maybe helped to know what can match better.
"Talking to applicants will get you amazing results. More often than not, the CV will not paint the correct picture and talking to the candidate explaining what you are expecting, to see what the candidate can bring to the table, how big is the gap and if there are opportunities to bridge it will make all the difference.

Agreed, you will be receiving a ton of resumes and its not possible to talk to each of them. At least at senior levels, this may be a good practice to start. 
Also, you should be able to sniff genuine candidates to talk to, from the CV itself. "

"As no one will contact the applicant, concerning the status of her/his application, the process of recruitment or hiring is taking much time. I do know due to high volume of applicants for one particular vacant position, it might take time for the hiring manager to short-list the best candidates among the applicants, but I felt clueless as i really do not know what's going on, and what's is the real reason behind my rejection; to whom I can follow-up or chase to get the reason of the rejection; as SCM-SME, supply chain processes will be the same, even though the product I will handle will be different from one industries to another, either it is consumer items, diagnostic equipment or spares or the likes.

take recruitment serious. I feel extremely poorly treated and will certainly NOT reco J&J at anybody - not as a staff nor as a supplier.
To have more communication with the person of what the person need to obtain the position want it
I worked with Janssen on contract for approximately two and a half years. During that time I achieved significant success in growing the business - 43% growth with Caelyx and strong growth with Xeplion. I had the support and recommendations from my line managers to pursue a full time roles within the Johnson and Johnson organisation. I find it very strange that having achieved my successes to date by adhering to the Janssen Credo. I have not even been called to interview. My experience of the recruitment process has therefore been very disappointIng.

I have no record of receiving an response on this particular position (that it had been filled). Having said that,  I have received responses of this nature on other positions.  It may be an error on my end.   A response is always appreciated - even a negative one - and it has not impacted my view of J&J.  "
"Bonjour
Se qu il peuve faire de rencontrer les personnes et non de juger sur le CV sans les voirs et de communiqué l' un et l'autre de leur poing de vue .
Cordialement."
Nothing
"To contact the applicant, give a chance to present him/her self. Inform the applicant about the process and timeline. Communicate information whatever the status is."
"Thank you for the automated emails telling me that I was under review, then it was chosen to not pursue my candidacy.  I really think that there have been improvements made in the process by allowing candidates to track the progress; however, I think that even an email letting the candidate know why they were not selected - specifics for what would be needed to achieve a successful candidacy including interview and feedback for internal applicants would allow the candidates know what extra skills or experiences would allow them to succeed in future endeavors for the positions applied for which would inspire people like me to work on building those skills for the next time an opportunity such as this would be beneficial.  
Also, the new My Next Step should allow internal employees to search by location in order to find jobs in their area without having to search through hundreds of positions, similar to the search functions found in the old ""my career opportunity"" sections.  
Again, I strongly encourage J&J to focus on educating and promoting associates already in the company as they have knowledge that takes outside hires longer to make strong decisions (even up to a year before they are knowledgeable enough on the internal processes and operating systems required to make sound decisions which address the issues that arise in the most beneficial way to the company as a whole.)  I read recently that J&J promotes approximately 30% of internal applicants.  I agree that companies need a diverse work force and new employees bring new ideas and observe opportunities for improvement often missed by internal associates that can overlook items as they grow accustomed to them.  I also believe that hiring management level employees from outside is not always the best for the company because they don't have the internal knowledge needed to provide leadership depending on the role.  I suggest hiring outside employees at a lower level and having them learn and advance with time, and educating the most knowledgeable and committed internal employees in order to place them in upper positions as they are familiar enough with our past, present, and often have great solutions which make sense and add value.
I am sincerely trying to better myself and find a way to progress to the next level but the interviews I have had internally have provided feedback that I am overqualified, yet I make less money than the employees selected and have not had an opportunity to advance with the knowledge I have worked hard to learn in order to be a well informed candidate for many positions.  
Finally, it seems that internally as positions are posted, often the employee has already been chosen to fill the new role.  It seems interviews are mere formalities.  I actually received feedback that the recruiter felt I was the best fit with the best qualifications for a job for which I had applied, yet my feedback stated that they did not see what the recruiter saw in me and while my interview was good, I did not adhere as strictly to the STAR format as they felt was necessary when answering questions.  I feel stuck in my role and even demoted and I have no way to address this despite 5 years of complete immersion and learning skills I felt would benefit the company including complete dedication and commitment to my job role.

"Dear J&J team, 

Recruitment process involve applicants who are human, that is why a telephone conversation would be better than an automated email especially with senior position, i.e. I received the automated email which confirms the receipt of my CV on 12 March and I received the email which informs me that another candidate was selected on 13th March. For an HR professional honestly does not make scene! This gives the impression that a candidate was selected long time back and the advertisement for the post was just part of the process to satisfy.
Moreover, the CV gives only 20% information about the candidate, the phone and the face to face interviews give more in depth information about the candidate.
This should be done in a more human (phone or face to face) and professional way as sometimes technology does not help in giving the full picture.
Thank you., 
Dheya Alshakar"
Don't ask by phone which salary you want. This is a personal question to ask at the live interview.
I did not receive an invite for an interview.
I did not get some responce at all! I do not even know if the position is occupade or not. I have only got an not to replayable confirmation email.
The recruiting process could focus more on meeting potential candidates and viewing unique qualifications rather than focusing in a computer based selection process

"The time limit given between the online application form and the video interview is insufficient.

For example, my resume for is not perfect or I have to work my communication skills. My opinion is education and experience are one thing, everything can be learned.  All my working place I have to face one issue what is the working behavior, significant portion of the employee does not care about the roll.

"You apply for a job & Boom. It is done, no update after the application, except for the survey asking for the feedback. Going through all the emails, leave alone recruiter sending out an email, not a single email was received for rejection even from the automated system. "

"I applied Three times for suitable posts and I was contacted by a recruiter in two cases. Had a quick chat over the phone and I was not so much impressed by the recruirer skills. Furthermore She used tipical J&J internal jargon that of course I could not know. 
It was Clear She was not so much interested as She looked for someone from pharma industry Even if it's not extremely important for an IT management Role. 
My opinionion is that the selection process was only formal (typical in Italy) as the   candidate to be hired was decided already
This was not a surprise for me as I know how the Best US policies bacame completely useless in Italy"
at least they contact candidate for interview . 
There has  been absolutely no one who has taken initiatives from JOhnson & Johnson's end to get in touch with me.The entire point of applying is obsolete. Highly dissapointed.

The hiring manager for the position was also very professional (Preeti Kanoji, Field Director MSL Solild Tumor for Janssen Oncology). I would also like to go on record and praise the professionalism and integrity of Jannell DePalantino and Amy Jurek, both are Field Directors for MSL Hematology Team for Janssen Oncology. J&J should recognize each of these individuals for representing J&J. Even though I was not the right fit for the specific position, they represented the company in the highest standard.

No personal contact at all. 
Personal contact would be nice......
"Please provide exact reason for not selecting , based on that we can improve further interviews"
"I submitted my resume/application for this role, but was not personally contacted by a recruiter for further screening.  Therefore, my responses will skew results.  Hope this is helpful.

Thank you,

Get back to the job applicants even if they are not shortlisted.
"I submit my application on line and 6 months later I received a generic rejection email. I guess this is due to high volumes of applications but it detears applicants from viewing other positions, as we are aware there will be a better candidate for available positions"
Give a better email response
Faire un retour des interviews et informer du choix final !!
Provide feedback on why I was not a good fit for the position.
"As I normally believe, high quality products and Companies, improve their quality continuously. I'm sure J&J recruitment process will do it.
My only concern, considering the job I applyed, I could have been hired in Brazil and transfered to the US. Unfortunately, I was born in Brazil. I hold all licences and requirements for that position.

"1) Direct communication with job applied person.

2) categorise by skill , education, experience need for required post (by communication)

3) fast interview shedule by analysing above details."
"Your recruiter should respond to calls or emails.  The first phone screen was completed with a recruiter who was so disinterested, it was a terrible representation of your company.  The second interview told me I would hear back within a week and it has been over six months.  I have accepted another offer as VP of Customer Service Operations."
They never contacted me

"I applied for the position in October 2016 and, other than confirmation of receipt of my application immediately after it was submitted, I did not receive any other communication until February 2017.  Quite honestly, I was surprised to hear from you and thought my application had been decided months ago.
"
Do a better job of communicating.
"Every time I apply for a position at J&J I never hear from a recruiter but get a survey when you close out my application.  From a candidates view it is extremely distasteful to be asked my experience but only having the experience of sending in an application, not hearing anything for months and then getting a survey on ""how the process went.""
I realize there are many good candidates for a job, and I may not always be the best applicant for every position. However as a board certified , fellowship trained physician with almost 15 years experience in pharma, it seems highly unusual that J&J never even gets as far as a phone screen for my applications.  As such I'm sure you would understand why I don't find your talent acquisition process extremely favorable or actually effective at screening qualified talent.

I hope this helps you improve your process....if indeed that is what you are hoping to do for the future.  I have always respected the J&J family of companies but the recruitment process has taken me by surprise.

Respectfully,
Linda Scheer, MD





"
Provide a positive/negative feedback to the participants of the recruitment process.
I'd suggest J&J recruiter could be more transparent and frank explainning the reasons the candidate complies (or not) the role requirements.
"I had a recruiter email and call me to have me apply to the position. I called and emailed him to confirm that I had applied, but I received no other communication regarding my application or why I was declined. I have had directly applicable experience and I should have at least been phone screened/interviewed for the position."
Give a short explanation why the candidate is not suitable for the position in order to allow the candidate to evolve. This would be profitable both for the candidate that could work on his/her flaws and for the company that wouldn't be accused of not caring with peoples expectations/feelings.
"I found another position.  The comment is ""move as quickly as possible to find, interview, and make the decision to hire great talent""."
This position has been taken down twice with no feed back as to why. 
Any applicant should reply must the company according to his qualification with experience.
"1) give FEEDBACK towards the people that are applying regarding the reasons for not going forward with them in the processen (especially when digital interviews were performed!!)

2) PLEASE have the DECENCY to inform people on a timely manner when you provide dates for the ""potential"" next steps in the process and decide not to go forward with them. In my particular case, 3 dates were given to me for the ""potential"" next steps. Since I already work, I had to take 3 days of leave (since I was very serious about applying at J&J). I had to sent mails myself to the recruitment team to find out more than a week later (when already 2 of the 3 dates passed) I was not selected. Which I fully respect but FYI, I also have only 20 annual holidays of which I wasted 3 to the incompetence of the recruitment team to take 2 minutes to sent me a mail. 

I have never had such a disappointing experience with any company... "
Include an HR representative in the interviewing process to insure all departments are selecting qualified candidate for the available position. This will prevent and put a stop to the buddy buddy system that is obviously being used.    
"I think Johnson & Johnson is doing the right in the recruiment process, I appreciate a lot this opportunity to complete this survey, thank you for your response to my recent request,  I hope my profile could be useful for you in the future.

Best regards,

"Enhance the contact with the applicants, making phone calls to inform the status of the application process or vacancy. That will give you a 10/10 score!"
It is good
keep candidates updated
At least to call
"From the date of application to the response, it was very slow.  I was informed that I did not get the job in a generic email.

I would not have applied to the position if I did not think I was qualified for the position.  I understand that J&J probably had a lot of applicants but I felt that the email was very generic and insensitive.

"
"I have received this invitation to take the survey for the third time for three different job posting openings I applied for, no one contact me for my applications every time I apply although the criteria mentioned in the posting with highly matched with my qualification!
I changed my mind to apply in any future openings in J&J because I believe that all of this openings are not treated fairly or professionally.
last but not least, I cant add what you can do to improve the recruitment process because I didn't get involved in any."
No suggestions at this time.
"Please conduct an interview to fully understand the resume given to the company. At least, it could give other perspectives about the candidate. Besides, the company should conduct phone interviews to evaluate the candidates in term of their personal character, language spoken and others. It could really help the candidates to gain more knowledge and experience in job interview."
"Provide candidates with the reason why they are not a good fit, even if chosen out of a predetermined list."
"One of the idea to improve is to create a careers blog for your company . Kick your job content up a notch by having a regular blog devoted to all things related to careers at your company. Invite your recruiters and hiring managers to periodically contribute content that would be helpful for your applicants, and encourage job seekers to subscribe to your blog's RSS feed so they get the latest updates."
I received ejecting notification only if my deselection 9 months after the process.
Quicker response to applicants.
Contact with the candidates by phone.
"After working for J&J as a Kelly temp for over 14 years I never received a phone call in regard to any of the admin positions I applied for. I felt I was more than qualified with my 25 years plus is being an admin up to and including working for the CEOs and board of directors. Unfortunately I finally gave up and started looking elsewhere for a position. After looking I finally found a job working as a subcontractor for Bristol-Myers Squibb through Jones Lang LaSalle. That being said I am no longer interested in employment at J&J. It might be beneficial for some one, a person to take a closer look at these resumes. Because I really don't think your recruiting staff is doing such a great job."
"I didn't hear back for over a month. The next communication I received stated that the position had been eliminated. 

Still looking for an opportunity to work with Johnson and Johnson! I'll keep checking and applying for opportunities.

"Even if i applied for the position of ""Assistant Brand Manager"", I have not received a proper reply if my CV is evaluated or fit for this position from the recruiter. So i am asking you why do you send me an evaluation survey? "
I'd love to have feedback on why I was not considered to be a good fit for the position.
"explain to the candidat why he hasn't been choosed for the position, or to proceed the recruiting process."
Contact the potential candidates and inform them that they won't be contacted for an interview or let them know they weren't selected.
N/A
I never had an interview phone or otherwise.  No one ever contacted me.  I applied for this position months ago.  My surprise is that I received this survey??????
"It's difficult for me to comment on this because I never actually interacted with J&J's TA team. I applied for a position (Regional HR Compliance EMEA Manager - 1600133667W), for which I believed I was highly qualified, but received only a rejection email. 

I was a Global HR Policy Manager for 4 years and am now employed by one of your competitors in a similar position in Prague. So, I was quite surprised that my application did not result in - at least - a phone call. 

So, the only feedback I could provide is, perhaps, a review of the systems for reviewing talent.    "
"First: Again, I was not called for any interview. In the last process I have applied the young lady in charge of interviewing me was eating snacks while I was talking. That is not really a professional way to do it. Second i was informed about a label I got from her which I disagree totally. J&J shall take this process more seriously."
reasons on not selection.
Maybe is better to have chance more people to be part of J&J recruitment process because it is better to see experience and challenges of people
Inform the candidate about reason why the individual was not considered
I never received any feedback as to why I was not chosen for a role that I had previously done successfully on a maternity leave.
"Improve the feedback and the support to the candidates.
Sending email after two months without any previous contact, it is really disappointing."
"The interview was very qucick, via Skype and the interviewer show no interested in making the interview, jut to get rid of the process with me.

I know I´m a good fit to the position but she didn´t let me express it and after that i didn´t recived any feedback from her.

Way too bad experience as a process i was very enthusiastic about."
Provide timely feedback after the last interview as well as clearly explain the reasons why the candidate is not a good fit. 
I have applied to several positions with Johnson&Johnson.  Primarily because I know that it is an excellent company to work for and has outstanding products.  However I have never received a response via email letter regarding the status of my applications or the position.  
apart from this type of survey you people just go through the resumes and if any profile suits to your requirement you call them no need of this type of surveys.
Advise on rationale for decline and improve overall personal contact
Please notify the applicant if she or he is selected for next hiring process.
More interviews to tackle the competencies
I think recruiters should meet candidates face to face to appreciate how much they are motivated to get the position.
Nothing
"I don't necessarily feel that my background (outside J&J's industry group) was given a fair assessment.  My experience as a project manager is easy transferable, and J&J would have been a great employer for me.  To not hear back is disappointing, at best."
"Recruitment process is pathetic. They don;t even bother to call even and know if I am fit or not.

Looks like all set inside this just to show they have followed the process."
mmmmmm
Contact people who apply instead of send like 10 survey emails and not one updating me on my application status.
Unfortunate to state that no one from J&J has written or spoken ....
"Maybe providing a feedback why application was rejected:
1. It would provide respect for the jobseeker for time spent processing the application and can be an indicator of how a corporation would treat its potential and future employees and assets.
2. Give an indicator of gaps to cover for candidate really interested in joining j&j"
I would like to talk with a recuiter to present my experiences.
I never interviewed.  I applied and an invite to take this survey was all that happened for me
"Given I am the Immediate Past President of a non-for-profit organization (NSN Atlanta), J&J has sponsored for over a decade, I find it surprising I was not given a courtesy recruiting call. I have over 10 years experience in the biotech/pharma space and trained an immunology product for several years. 

I believe there should be a streamline recruiting process for individuals who are a part of organizations J&J sponsors on a consistent basis. "
"I am a Physician Assistant and practiced medicine for a number of years prior to getting into medical sales.  I have had a successful career working for such companies as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Forest Pharmaceuticals, and Baxter Healthcare.  I have even been ranked number one on numerous occasions.  I am certainly more than qualified for the position that I applied for.  With all of that, I was not even contacted by J&J by phone.  There is certainly something wrong with a system where someone with my qualifications is not even given a personal interview. "
"I have great interest to work for J&J, especially in Florida.  Have a recruiter contact an applicant who continues to apply to help them understand why they are not being considered for positions at J&J."

#NAME?
"Having real awareness of the feedback they give to people who do not hire, is a machine! People are not machines and my feeling is that they do not give themselves the real time to know me as a professional"
Transparency and prompt response.
You are one of the very few companies that send the auto reply thank you for applying but we selected another candidate.  Looking for employment process is already overwhelming and time consuming letting candidates know you filled the position helps them move on and be informed during the process. 
J&J is a world wide best class reputation corporation; I guess we all in the industry will love an opportunity at J&J.
Please contact the candidate may he explain briefly 
"I just have received negative / not follow on my application for J&J position. I didn t go to any process of recruitment , in this case I cannot give feedback.
I have only received e mail from J&J saying that my application will not be considered. I will be good to get more insights on the why, but I assume that due to the high quantity of applications, this step is not possible.
Best regards,
Rebecca LECHE"
You could improve your recruitment process by not automatically ruling out candidates based on having too much experience in the field. Please look at the breadth of industry experience as being an asset to your sales team and not an automatic trigger to rule someone out for consideration.  
At least contact applicant .
Never received an email or heard from anyone!!!
provide timely feedback
Improvement in the response time is possible
Improve updates and feedback in the process stage
Respond to applicants. I have never heard anything until this email after I have made the application in August last year.

"I did not receive any notification or update of the position until this survey. Communication is lacking, usually I will receive a form letter letting me know that ""we have decided to choose another candidate"" without giving a reason. This makes me believe that someone has already been chosen for the position and I am just a filler. This time I did not receive even that communion."
"I do not know, i ve never been at johnson&johnson "
"Your survey stinks I was never contacted by a recruiter at all.  You really should design your survey better and maybe you'd get some information out of it that would actually help.  

Since Johnson & Johnson didn't take my candidacy seriously I don't appreciate you wasting my time with your survey.  "
When screening CVs for short listing for interviews it would be best to review without the bias of location. Or if there are people with more senior profile then a chance should be given to explain to the individual for the interest in a different geography or into a junior position. This would help in probably meeting the best fit / candidate for the role.

"How about not asking me to fill out six different surveys for starters.  

I applied to J & J for a career, not to be hounded by your survey requests multiple times.  Your desire to obtain this information, that doesn't seem to make a difference one way or another to a candidate you didn't deem acceptable to your organization, is annoying. 

So far I've had more contact with J & J regarding surveys than about the actual job.  For shame."
I did not receive any communication from the recruiter after the first phone interview. I feel with my experience and being on the community speakers bureau I would have had a second phone interview. 
Everything is ok.

Timely feedback of result of each phase of the recruitment.
I never heard back from j&j
"received an email indicating position was on hold, so these questions are not worded to match this scenario"
Would have liked to known the reason for not being selected. That would have helped me to improve myself 
"Your process is non-personal and slow. This survey is proof of that. I didnt use a recruiter, I found the position on Linkedin and applied via the company website. This survey doesn't even explore how I applied. I never had an interview. I applied for 3 jobs, which I know I'm qualified for and each time I got a computer generated email after about 6 weeks saying no thanks. Then you have the nerve to ask for my feedback on your recruitment process, twice. Your process is flawed and outdated. Try moving into this century and at least have a phone screen, then make a determination. If you can tell via a resume that the person isn't qualified or a good fit, then have the courtesy to send an email from a real HR person in a timely fashion."
"Provide more accurate and timely feedback to the aplicant.
To this time I still believe I meet requirements for the position I applied for and to this day I do not know why I was not interviewed ;also I 'd be nice to asses if the applicant skills meet other openings requirements "
 Revert  the candidate within time frame after we applied for some particular positions.
"It can improve the interviewing and selection process, giving professionals the opportunity to defend their knowledge and improve the feedback process with candidates"

It would be nice if you had the courtesy to at least let people know they are out of the running instead of a total lack of communication."
"No communication. Nothing human about the process, we are treated like data and people interested in becoming part of your company."
Maybe just provide some more insight on what candidates can do to help improve their chance of getting into your amazing company. I know there all lots of factors that play into the hiring process and sometimes its just about timing. Im determined to get an interview so will keep trying.

"I would like to suggest that you communicate the status of the candidate.  I was never given any feedback, positive or negative during the process."
"Need to update candidates in a more timely manner. Even if a decision hadn't been made yet, update the candidate to let them know.

The process was very impersonal. You feel like a number. It would be more professional if you received an email with a reason why you did not receive an offer. Mine was simply that you were moving forward with other candidates. I don't remember if I was invited to join J&J's talent community but I don't think so."

"I was qualified as an applicant (4 years as a clinical specialist) and didn't even receive a phone call or email.  My last two positions were short stints in very small startups and irrelevant to the job description.

I'm currently seeking a quality company where I can be exposed to a career opportunity and do great work and build on my skill sets."

I hope that pharna companys like J&J would give all applicant a chance most especially with extensive experience in pharmaceutical and medical device sales a chance to be hearf through an actual in person interview and not be judged solely on the resume. I am backed up with 20 years experience in sales working for global companies but have not been given a chance to be interviewed. 
I think by contacting the job applicant by mail / telephone.
In my humble opinion recruiting the best candidate is always a way to improve the process.
Should mention clearly duties and liabilities.  And should consider the people who has vast experience no matter...in the same product because he or she has the experience in the field!
"On a positive note, there Wada response advising that the individual is not a suitable candidate.  This is extremely helpful as most organizations does not take the time to respond at all.

Feed back on why a candidate is not a suitable match would be even more beneficial.

Do not ask to complete surveys if you have not provided an actual response on the selection process result.
"I understand that it is difficult to speak to people individually when looking to fill a position.

I think i am fit for this position so i one face to face interview should be done with me and with every person who is applying for this post because without taking interview of first phase it would be too much difficult to say that candidate is not fit.

I then did not  hear anything from J&J until 8th of March by email rejection - with a note in the rejection email: 'Please do not reply to this message. Replies are undeliverable and will not reach the Human Resources Department.' THAT IS REALLY REALLY BAD PRACTICE!!
I had a face to face interview, and you do not have the decency to be willing to explain why my application was rejected. DREADFUL. Absolutely outrageous.

"Before applying to your company I was persuaded you had an excellent HR talent acquisition team. 

I have been interviewed by a kind well mannered recruiter for a junior position within your company. According to her I had all necessary skills for the position and much of motivation to become a member of your company. I was told I was going to be interviewed by the higher manager the following week so I waited for 2 weeks without any contact from your part. I even sent an email to the recruiter asking her for updates in my candidacy. She never responded.

I'm a qualified MSc business psychologist speaking 3 languages and with this huge motivation to enter into a structured working environment without even minding to start from the lowest position and advance later into the company.  

I think that giving false information and not responding to your candidates isn't appropriate for a company such as yours.

Both recruiters I talked with were very kind. I'm wondering however are you honestly searching to recruit new people ? I will try to talk about this via your social networks with Mr. Sjoerd Gehring.

Thank you again for your time and consideration."

"Your e-recruitment is a very good tool, however, i think that if the applicant was rejected for whatever reason to continue in a hiring process, it doesnt mean that he or she is not interested in joining on another recruitment process. It would be attractive to receive constantly the offers directly to the mail entered by the applicant in the database of the company, which is requested by you from the beggining as requirement inscription to access to your database and thus, avoiding the consult of the same offer through external websites of the company. Thanks. "
You will contact the candidates to report the result of the interview
You sucks!
"You should try to give more importance to the candidates. We all have things to do, and it is not fair that the recruiters tell you to write them or call them for feedback and when the time comes they are not even able to answer back a short e-mail or at the phone, for a big company like yours who have important values, these should also be part of them."
"You should personally contact candidates (by phone call) to inform they have not been selected. 
I invested too much time in your talent page and gave you a lot of personal information in order to apply to one position, so at least I would like to know my application was considered."
"You should keep informed the status of the recruitment, I thought it was stopped, until I'd received a negative response, many months after I'd signed for the place."
You should indicate why I am not a candidate for the position
"You should improve the clarity of the process, I was asked to send my CV twice and then I had no news of the process"
"You should have a quicker process. People should know that they would not continue with the process one week after they send the aplication form, so they are not waiting to get an answer for a long period. 

When you get an applicant who most likely match with the possition but you catch a weakness you should give this information to the applicant. In that way they will have the opportunity to improve their skills and could be the next member of Johnson & Johnson's Family."
You should give some feedback about the process. We spent a lot of time for calls and interviews and then nobody gives you an explanation about what went wrong.
You should follow the equal opportunity employeemnet policy and stop hiring only recomended canidates. There are good candiates out there waiting for an opportunity to be interviewed.
You should contact candidates before sending this survey. I was never contacted by the recruiter. 
You should contact and provide reason of the not good for the position
"You should consider the follwoing:

Stablish a training program with High School / College Students, you might offer them an interim opportunity and give them a chance to know more about your products and company job activities.

Settle University Teams and conduct at specific Universities a permanent hiring program.

"Yes, a lot! I was very disappointed of your recruitment process. I highly esteem J&J and all of its high quality products, use them every day of my life. Got the opportunity to attend a Career event for IRDP at IE Business School and was extremely excited of the possibility of being selected. However, I applied back in October, heard back soon and had a one brief phone competency based interview (my interviewer called late and was running short of time for the call). She mentioned I would hear back from them soon and also mentioned the process had to be finalized between december and january.

I thought that went well and heard back at the end of december, when I was asked to perform the Hogan Assessment online. Then I never heard back again, until April 22nd, when I received a standard e-mail saying I hadn't been selected.

I was super disappointed of never hearing back from a human, of the very long time waits and of never actually having a real interview!!! I believe I am a great fit, it is my dream to work for J&J, I have an amazing backlog of projects in mind but J&J hasn't given me the opportunity to discuss them.

Extremely disappointed of this very disorganized process :("

Why posting a position to candidates outside the company if there was already an employee that was chosen... just to complete the process and say you give equal rights??? Frustrating...

Examples - 'For this position which you've applied, Relocation is not available, we can not proceed farther'.

- 'Your local language skill is too poor to consider, for security reason we can not offer you this role in this country.'

"Well, I've never get a feedback from Johnson & Johnson, probably I won't receive any feedback about this e-mail. Some positions I tried, but I was uncertain about my experience and the position, but others like this position I consider my experience should be heard.
GE has a system where I can see the positions that I applied and the status of them, even I don't receive any information from GE, but it is possible to know the status, I am not aware something like this at J&J.
And also I would like to know the reason for J&J never called me to heard my experience, I read a lot of documents to improve my resume, I paid a professional to evaluate my resume before to send to J&J and I think that I am not a bad professional for J&J.

O peor aun, dan el puesto a personas que son amigos, familiares o conocidos de los gerentes que toman decisiones para contratar; aunque estas personas no tengan experiencia en el puesto.  Por este motivo ni siquiera somos considerados para entrar a otras empresas; simplemente por el hecho de ser éticos, honestos y profesionales.

En mi caso ni siquiera fui contactado por nadie de la compañía para entrevistarme, siendo que por mi experiencia fácilmente era candidato a cubrir el puesto al cual me postule.

estimados, la idea de aplicar a sus postulaciones, apesar de no conar con todos los requisitos, es por el amor que le tengo a J&J, yo labore de 1997 al 2000 y por falta de oportunidad de crecer dentro de la empresa, tuve que migrar, lamentablemente no termine mi carrera universitaria, pero se que puedo aprender y desarrollar mi talento y gusto por las ventas y negociaciones y mas si es de J & J.

Aun tengo en mente los Sku de J&J en  HEB.

Las lineas que ya no se manejena en Mexico, Shower To Shower, Carefree, Reach, Serenity, co Tylenol, Tylenol Synus, ROC, gran parte de Neutrogena, etc, 

Gracias por la atencion y ojala y un dia pueda regresar a J&J y aportar mi experiencia y ganas de apender.

Saludos cordiales

The idea of applying to your applications, despite not meeting all the requirements, is because of the love I have for J & J, I worked from 1997 to 2000 and due to lack of opportunity to grow within the company, I had to migrate , Unfortunately I did not finish my university career, but I know I can learn and develop my talent and taste for sales and negotiations and more if it is J & J.

I still have J & J Sku in mind at HEB.

The lines that are no longer handled in Mexico, Shower To Shower, Carefree, Reach, Serenity, Tylenol co, Tylenol Synus, ROC, much of Neutrogena, etc.,

Thank you for the attention and hopefully one day I can return to J & J and bring my experience and desire to learn.

"To tell you guys the truth, I didn't even know I was not selected for this position as well as what was the reason why I was not a good fit for the position I've applied to, I've been applying for IT Division since September 2016 and I can tell you guys I always got really useful feedback from all recruiters telling me why I was not a good fit for their positions. It helps me put that feedback into action to become a better candidate.

My interview with HR team member was about 5 minutes by phone, nobody from IT Division even talked to me, in my opinion, not only is it unjust and undignified, but it causes problems to get a new opportunity in the future.

My colleague Clovis Inacio Pereira - GTSBR (cperei50@ITS.JNJ.com) knows all my work experience in technology very well that's the reason he has referred me on 2 different occasions at J&J, he shares the same thoughts about all this situation.

Finally, if I applied to your position, which I did, but you did not contact me at all, I'm pretty sure that shouldn't be considered as taking part of your process.

There is a lot of recruitment process fake in JnJ. 
"There is a great disconnect between human resource personnel and the individual requesting the vacant position. HR representatives rarely provide updates, and never provide feedback when candidates are not selected for position.

I believe talented individuals are being overlooked by the strict and disengaged recruitment process. I feel the recruitment process negatively reflects on such a great company as J&J."
There are many of us who have the capacity to learn and give our best to fill various vacancies that the company offers. The company should give a chance to these people who just want a chance to show they deserve the job.
"There are a lot of problems on J&J recruitment process. I'm speaking based on my experience with J&J for Brazil and LATAM hiring processes:

- I was contacted in 2015 by phone for an interview. The recruiter was polite but didn't tell me which position he was working on and didn't give me any feedback why or why not I would be considered for that position. I just gave up waiting for a response.

- I've applied for more than 20 different positions at J&J's website for the past two years. Very rarely I receive any answer or feedback for why or why not I was considered. Not that I would demand a detailed answer, but at least I'd like to have a negative answer for not being chosen. I can tell you that this might have happened in 5% or less of the applications. You open positions and never properly close them.

- There are positions that seems that are not meant for people outside J&J. That's precisely the case of the Sundown Senior Brand Manager position. The opportunity opened in January 2017 and in less than a week was closed. Most probably, someone wanted to promote or put a person already in mind for the position (which is fair enough), but perhaps was forced to open the position in J&J's career site. This is frustrating and disrespectful for someone who is looking for a job. Never do that! You're creating false hope and when you think you're competing for the new job and happy for applying, you just realise one week later that it was a ""fake"" position, that never was truly open in the first place.

- I was again contacted by J&J in December 2016 for the position I applied for Marketing Manager for Vision Care. The HR person phoned me saying they needed me to do an interview at the same day since it was urgent, and they wanted to close the position until the end of the year. Thus, I managed to find time and I did the interview late at that day. The chat was polite and respectful. However, after that, I sent a couple of emails for the recruiter to question about the process and never had an answer back. Not even saying if the position was filled, postponed or anything. Even now, I don't know if I'm still being considered or not. Since it was some time ago, in my opinion 'receiving no answer' can be considered as an answer. But, again, it was frustrating and I'm surprised that a lovely and wonderful company as J&J does that sort of thing. It should never happen!

You have the right to not want someone for a position or to consider someone else, to freeze hiring, to downsize, to prefer internal promotions or anything. The problem is how you're dealing with applicants, by not giving answers, not giving feedback, not properly posting true positions (not to be merely placed on career site and be taken out shortly after) and not being respectful to job seekers.

I'm saying all this since I'm a big fan of J&J and I hope that from my feedback you can improve the hiring process and put yourselves in the candidate's shoes. Perhaps you might be losing good talent and you'll never know why they never joined J&J, even when they really tried hard to.

If you need any other candid feedback, feel free to reach me.

Yours sincerely,

"The true is that I only had an interview by teleconference however The recruiter did know exactly the position they were interviewing me and did not had any information about it.  they told me that would be calling me again, that never happened.

So I did not had feedback any Other call and any kind Of formal interview that I could present myself and the recruiter knows about muy experience because I am pretty sure that I could feet in the position.

Tks for your attention "
The treatment could be more personalized through a telephone contact. 
The timeframe between interviews is too long 
The time between interviews is too large.. In my opinion J&J should reduce the time because it can cause to lose of good candidates that are participating in more than one selection process.
The third interviewer was rude and the interview became odd due to strange questions that I have never being asked before. What it needs to improve is the manner of speaking of some of the interviewers that affects Johnson and Johnson reputation. Johnson is a great company with great employees but this interviewer did a very disappointed interview.    
The talent community could be a better asset
The survey should be forwarded to candidates that have been contacted by JJ
The site is very well explained and easily accessible
The site is a little complicated for registration.
The response to the applicant should be more complete and friendly
"The recuitment was little bit strange, because the recuitment team call me explain that will be contact me, but this never happened. I've called to the phone number which given to me, but anybody answered. Totally disappointed."
"The recuiter never contact me.
"
"The recruter cancell our first meeting from last momento.  After I had a second meeting with her and it was fine.  The process was very long and in the second interview I had a different person appeared, not the BUD I was supposed to meet but  the Sales Manager.  He told me that the BUD had sent him due to the fact that she had other meeting scheduled, and that eventhough, he was not the one who had to take the decision, she would ask his feedback and reschedule.

I though this was not professional, I would had prefered to cancel and had the chance to meet the right person.  After one month later I just got a mail saying that they had decided to promote an internal candidate (that I assume should have been evaluated before).

Hopefully this information helps you to improve internal communication and processes. 

Best regards."
The Recruitment team difunto even contacted me. What si the purpose of having candidates fill out forms if the recruitment team does not contact the candidates. It seems pointless filling out forms. Looks like all processes are filled with people that the recruitment team already know rather than really review every form. 
the recruitment should send a mensage for us explain why the opportuny isnt good for us.
"The recruitment process, in my opinion, was too impersonal. I understand that automation is here for making things easier and more productive, however, I really believe that a space where the candidate could be directly in touch with the recruiter, even if this mean an additional space for a introductory letter."
"The recruitment process was straight forward. Although I was not selected for the interviews phase, I appreciated the feedback, which currently is not provided by most of the companies in Brazil. 
Thank you.
Kind regards,
Sergio Lima."
The recruitment process was really excellent!
"The recruitment process was clear and the interviewer demonstrated to be aware of the abilities that the candidate should have for this position.
Unfortunatelly the position was freezing."
"The recruitment process took longer than expected, and then the available position got cancelled. HR wasn't proactive towards the candidacy."
the recruitment process should be processed before sent an email about a survey 
"The recruitment process needs to improve about willing of the candidate to be relocated, double check the experience and skills required, disclosing information about salary offer and expectation of the candidates, try to keep a closer relationship with candidates outside the country where the position is available.
I am really disappointed about the recruitment process even worse because for many years working in Colombia I had a close relationship with Johnson&Johnson Medical (Bogota) such as: Eng. Mauricio Plazas and Adriana Tangarife and honestly this is my first time applying for a job with you.
I need to be honest with Johnson&Johnson Medical.
Thank you"
The recruitment process it's good. In my point of view they are very kind. 
"The recruitment process is very inefficient. I work daily with J & J staff and the process is very poor for the company that it is.

It is basic for any selection process to contact the applicant.
"
The recruitment process is ok for me.
The recruitment process is now a days very impersonal; voice to voice contact my ease the process for both parties.
"The recruitment process is indeed mechanical and impersonal .. I believe that at the beginning it is correctly because of the number of inscribed..
Sometimes the CV does not evaluate the professional, often the CV is good but the professional is not.
I think an interview via Skype might be interesting."
The recruitment process is fine the way it is now.
The recruitment process is a bit impersonal. 
"The recruitment process does not provide any feedback.
Comparing to the information in the job description posted at the site, my experiences and background, my formation, my skills, everything meet them. I should have some hiden desired issue that aren't mentioned, for any not clear reason, and that automathically exclude me from the processes.... I would like to know which is/are that/those issue(s).
I would be very glad if someone of the recruit team could have a short open conversation with me.

"The recruitment process could be easier. The page of J&J isn't friendly for me, but the atention of RRHH is great."
"The recruitment process conducted by J&J is excelent .
"
the recruitment process can improve giving a feedback when the candidate was not selected for the position.
The recruitment process answered above for me is in agreement with the company.
"The recruitment process advances according to the time established by the company, but the process would be more dynamic if the communication with the candidate was shorter. "
"The recruitment must have feedback and deadline. There wasn't even an e-mail with a negative answer and, because of that and in my point of view, the process was unprofessional."
The recruitment form is good and fast.
The recruiting team should call the candidate to conduct an interview to see the potentiality of the candidate.
"The recruiters could be more open minded and actually understand industries other than pharma to be able to evaluate potential similarities that would make experienced candidates with a different background a good investment for pharma companies. I come from the aeronautical industry, one of the most regulated industries, and work for a truly global company, but It seemed to me J&J is very traditional when it comes to HR in a way that only interview and hire people with pharma experience, not interest in a different and maybe innovative approach."
The Recruiter will contact the Applicant to inform the progress process
The recruiter should give a feedback about the interview. 
The recruiter should contact the cancdate to provide a reason why people are not a good fit for the position we applied to.
"the recruiter should contact me and provide a reason why I am not a good fit for the position applied. Understand the structure of the demanding Department for candidates, clarify it for candidates. Explain if there is something to hold the candidate to move to next steps. I think an adequate recruiter feedback helps to build company's reputation. "
"The recruiter should contact all by email, for example, to inform the position status."
"The recruiter sent me an email but never communicated with me in order to interview...

 I was filled out a format with personal information.

The recruiter doesn`t contact me and provide a reason why I was not a good fit for the position 
The recruiter didn't give me a clear vision of the job description and J&J needs.

"The recruiter did contact me, but it did not provide a reason, he just said I wasn't selected. I understand that sometimes for legal reasons it's not always a possibility to say why, that's why it's not a problem. I want to grow more intellectually and professionally, hopefully to some day join the J&J family. Have a good day to you. Juan"
The recruiter could make known the reasons why the position is not met

The recruiter could be more specific as to what I lacked (in terms of skills) in order not be selected for the next phase
"The recruiter contact didn't told me about the next step of the process , so it's confusing how I'm going to count this email as part of recruitment of Johnson & Johnson. "

The recluiters should provide feedback to the best candidates that didn't get the job.
"The progress information of the process and an explanation of why it is not possible to continue in the process is fundamental in a company with the quality of Johnson & Johnson, there are many ways to be able to deliver that information to the candidates"

"The process was long, i took about a month to give a  answer of the final decision. Otherwise, the process was easy and  well conducted. Thanks for the opportunity. "
The process was good.

Thank you very much."

The process that's ok! 
The process should consider all Employee life history before to take action against her / him. 
"The process it's clear!
I receved a feed back and I think is't so important.

The process is verry efficient.
The process is suitable
"The process is somewhat cumbersome, I still do not receive a phone call or confirm my application as well as To discard it, however if I have received the present Questionnaire, it would be more warm a phone call and feel so important and personal that means my participation, I firmly believe J & J is a family business Which values ​​the time and opportunities of those who make up or could be part of it."

"The process can be much better if the recruiter explains the reasons why the company did not choose you, or in other way, provide feedback in order to improve professionally for future interviews."
"The opportunities remain few days available for application and after 2 or 3 days  the website informs that the job is no longer available.
This situation discourages new applications because there seems to have some kind of internal selection."
The only time I received any email from J&J after I applied was this email to take the survey. Your recruiter -for lack of a better word- is a jackass.
"The only point I would like to suggest is to get clear the position, responsibilities and clarify the actual area structure."
"The only communication is thru the web site, could be by phone or face to face. It is not enough to know people by the web"
"The most important thing about the recruitment process is to maintain an equal job opportunity for the people who have applied in the Panama Local Market.

The long process response time. Please check the date I completed the registration with the date of this survey.
"The Johnson & Johnson recruitment process is a serious process that respects each candidate equally, I received e-mail in all my applications and in a kind and respectful way, this is very important and it increases my dream to be part of this team, this Family ... But I think there is possibility of understanding in an application even if your qualifications are not 100% the same as described in the vacancy, sometimes a candidate has knowledge in the area, but did not have the opportunity for growth either in the company where Works or the company that worked but is important and what can be considered is the willpower, determination and willingness to learn and grow professionally and contribute to the company.
"
The Johnson & Johnson recruiter must contact the prospective employer in order to provide him the reasons why wasn't apply for the position. 
The Johnson & Johnson could to send e-mail more personal. But is one process good. Thank you. 
"the J & J Brazil recruiters should be less arrogant, overbearing, and have a little more humility in the process with professionals."
"The interviwer did not even read my cv, made unsophisticated, even silly, questions. I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the interview and interviewer."
"The interviews and questionnaires should be more personalized in my case postulates for a position in the marketing area that did not get all the required feedback, even if it was a negative response from the recruiter, I only got this survey."
"The interview was very qucick, via Skype and the interviewer show no interested in making the interview, jut to get rid of the process with me.

I know I´m a good fit to the position but she didn´t let me express it and after that i didn´t recived any feedback from her.

Way too bad experience as a process i was very enthusiastic about."
The interview was  by conference. I think that with an interview in person you can have a better understanding and connection with the candidate
"The improvement in the recruitment process could have a good start by providing a reason why candidate is not a good fit for the position he applied to because we may be very close to go further in the process but we do not know what is still missing to succeed.
Just send automatic replies or questions do not reflect transparency, independent process or a good job being done to get the best candidate.
Additionally, J&J should inform when starts and finishes the process.
On the other hand, the first filter has to be made by the one (senior) who is responsible for and is demanding the required professional because he will be able to fully understand the skills presented in the resumé to correctly fulfill the position, then go to the others to share point of views and to step ahead!

Thank you for the opportunity!

the I-Mails and computer as a recruitment process dont replace a job interview
The human resources sector could return to the candidate the real reasons why he was not approved for the vacancy
"The HR recruitment of Latin America was terrible, had no idea of the position she was interviewing me and I had the feeling I was being interviewed by a robot on the phone. 
Did not expect this from J&J...very dissapointing that I never heard back from the call we had. "
The first thing the recruiter should do is contact the candidate.
"The first thing that a postulant seeks is information about the selection process, so a written communication via mail is highly desired to know if you really can have an opportunity to advance in that process. Another thing that is always asked is if a postulant is in progress in other selection processes, so the answer will almost always be, yes. And this is precisely because they wait for a long time for a result that never comes. It is my sincere recommendation. Greetings."
"The first stage of the recruitment process was an english test, which I 'm sure I was very good rated.
For an unknown reason, I was not invited for an interview, and the vacancy was closed without any feedback from the recruiter."
"the feedback to the candidate.
thank you"
The feedback process could be better but I understand that maybe the number of applicants is huge to respond.
The feedback about the process was provided after I requested. It would be better if the recruiter call you or write you before you request.
"The experience I had in recruiting for a position was not very aggravating. I understand that technology is here to help, but conducting a telephone interview leaves a lot to be desired.
I believe that in an interview in person, the recruiter can better abstain the candidate.
I wish I could have talked to the recruiter better in person."
"The entire recruitment process was very clear, and followed all the scheduled dates, fulfilling all the schedules also without any relevant delay. However, during my interview with the managers, they left the room at all times, causing my interview to be broken, this attitude did not favor my communication, and it was visible the managers' willingness to accelerate the interview in order to finish as soon as possible. Senior management should reserve at least that hour listening to the candidate."
The entire process
"The e-mail's answers must be more specific, include more details that explain the cause for the reject "
The current recruitment process is perfect
The correct feedback for each application process.
"The contact we had was very limited, by email only, and with large periods of time in between the answers.
"
"The contact that the company has is good, what I can consider for better and serious recruitment process in a more personal way."
The contact by phone could be faster. 
The company should send feedback after completion  of process. Especially after the candidate reaches the final stage of process.
"The company should inform the applicant of the status of the process, since not receiving any information shows disinterested candidates, requires a time to register on the page and when you are in the job search the minimum that is expected is some answer"
The company should give a feed back on the process and what was not attended by the candidate
The company may ansewer the candidat.
"the company Johnson & Johnson the recruitment process, could offer the information or the causes of  because not selected was the candidate. 
"
"The company did not return informing if the person went through the selection process.
The company should evaluate better because often the person does not have the job function but knows how to develop the tarfe.
My dream as a teenager has always been to work in the company but so far I have not been able to"
"The company can make the list of vacancies, I got to the emails of people registered in its database, regardless of whether they are still part of the company, in addition to making the mechanisms more efficient and accessible through the Which can be applied to the vacancies, because sometimes they are confusing or present technical problems that are not solved in time and prevent applying to an employment opportunity within the established period

Thank you"
"The commmunication about the process is so importan and for that reason maybe you can give the status of that,while the process is open. When I received the call we accordanced an appointment. Due to internet conections the firts interview vía Skype  wasn't posible, then once again the company agent for HR contact me but this time sent me a link for an special platform. I was conected from 10 minutes before, but the person never was connected. Until nowadays never received an status about the process selection."
The candidates feedback could be improved and more detailed. 
"The analysts responded to all my questions and were so kind. So I had an excellent experiencie and nothing negative to say about the recruitment process. Continue in this way. 
Kind regards.

Florencia Delfino"
the above
The  candidate should receive at least one e-mail response about the recruitment process.
That's OK.
That's OK.
That's OK.
that's ok
That's OK
That the response times on the recruitment and selection process be short and inform the participant if he or she is fit for the position.
That the response is faster if it is acceptable or not
That the recruitment process is personal and direct.
That the recruiter have the contact. 
That the process is closer
"That put a page in Spanish and that we live in border it is discriminated against me that in the menu only you can change to French, Canadian, less in Spanish when its maquiladoras are in city juarez where there are many Mexicans"
"That it really exists, They never called or wrote or made me a feedback."
That is transparent.
That communicate directly with the applicant
that at least you respond to one if you were not selected
"Thanks to request my feedback. I believe that the resume should be have more analisys or to have an a first contact by phone to know more about the candidates for the position.
I use my self to example. I am a current employee for a big company and one of my objective is to have an evolution of my carrer in a company like JNJ (really shine my eyes), and most of the position is according my profile, but for the last months, I receive only one call to know more about me.
It is my consideration to improve your selective process"
thanks in advanced
Thanks for the notification. After reviewing the multiple opportunities open to Colombia I consider this one was not related to my experience and profile. I only related to the new Shared Service Center.
"Thanks a lot for give this oportunity to give a feedback. I was trying a recruitment in Brasil and just because my english is advance, not fluent, I was rejected. As you can see, my english isn't fluent but I'm sure that you understand all my mensage.
If you realy want to improve the recruitment process, the first step is to use the local language in the site.

Best regards

Murilo"
"Thank you for addressing me such survey.
I was actually surprised that J&J sent me a survey mail, after a 4-5 weeks reply (Automatic or Standard I might say) thanking me for taking part in the recruitment process. 
Well, you did not give me any chance to exchange ideas or at least speak with someone from J&J Human Resources. Even for an experience check. I feel like I was just cut from a CV superficial check, even being in the 3PL Logistics market for at least 16 years managing project development and sales structures and a deep knowledge of 3PL and logistics operations costs and prices. Really don't know what standards is J&J looking for. Certainly not the ones I have built during my career. 
But.. Thanks for the survey anyways.

Talk a little be more with the candidate. No only digital form. I believe with the personal contact can be better to the process.

Suggest improvement points for candidates meet the expectations.
Stop sending this emails! 
Stop sending me these survey emails!!!
"Stop including people in panels where they have not agreed to be a part of. Stop sending CONSTANT emails about surveys, especially to people who never spoke to a recruiter and were not offered an interview because you are likely to skew the data towards a negative slant and have more outliers than you originally planned for."
"Start with ""insiste people"" process, as a first process....and only in case that no one fit , open The Second process as external.
Thanks for the attention"
"Speed the answer and be more personal not only a general email, this can give us the opportunity to improve our profile to continue looking for a new opportunities in this great company."
Specialist recruiters waste valuable human resources. What is happening with corporations ? Why are you recruiting newbies and avoiding experienced people? 
Soy admiradora de esta empresa pero creo que deberían informar cuando no fuiste seleccionado en la búsqueda.
Sou PND gostaria de um feedback de não participar de uma entrevista pessoalmente? Não fui selecionado só porque moro em outra cidade? Lembrando que tenho disponibilidade de mudança de cidade.
Sometimes the answer is slow and makes you forget the inscription for the position. I believe that if the position is filled the candidate should receive a notification stating this.
"Sometimes part of the job description and osme questions are in another language (say, portuguese), but other parts of the application website are in english. Thus it is not clear whether we should answer the questions and upload documents in English or the other language."
Sometimes I feel that the resumes get lost in the online bank . I worked as an intern at JNJ  Medical and I felt that only indications worked well to get a job position. I had to leave JnJ for an international exchange program. I want to come back and take part in JnJ family  . 
"Something that you already know, if a person that also can be your client, make an application and you are not interested, send an e-mail informing, it doesn't has to take months to inform. I received the letter 3 months later. "
"Some times the feed back about process selection is to long, and I think company has not interested in my CV"
Some recomendations about other positiom that might be abble for me
Some questions about salary were not clear enough: what currency is been used.
Some level of feedback on improvement opportunities
"Sobre o processo para analista da qualidade prazo determinado 12 meses, ainda não obtive nenhuma resposta, mas por receber este questionário acho não fui selecionada."
"Sobre a vaga analista de assuntos regulatórios prazo determinado 9 meses, não obtive nenhuma resposta, mas por receber este email, acho não fui selecionada.
Para melhorar, que tal um email rápido, logo após o processo de candidatura se encerrar? "
"So, I have doubts about my process. Maybe, a call on my Phone would be perfect. "
"so far, i ve just applied to job post and this is the first contact from j&j"
So far I have not been contacted to continue with the selection process so I have no arguments to answer the question objectively
Skype interviews might be a good improoving process
"sking for surveys but i never got in contact neither have neither clls from any recruiters, but receive surveys of the process...
Please there are no coordinations...

"
"Sirs,

I would like to ask you to inform if I am in job selection that I was applied in J&J or not.


Thanks in advnce

"
Since the salary is confidential I have no good reasons to think is a good proposal for a professional. Knowing this previously would be a good way to improve the recruitment process
"Since I was never invited to a recruitment process, I wouldn't know.
"
Since I haven't recieved any feedback about not being fit for the position I am not sure how accurate I can answer this survey.
"Simply should try to closed the recruitment process, and Thank You very Much to invite to this survey . It means that J&J use the tools for improvement in this area. - Best Regards."
"Simplified processes, because it is in everyday life that we show our competencies and abilities that generate results."
Simplesmente não obtive nenhuma informação sobre o processo.
"simplemente manteniendo infomada a la gente  de, que, como, y cuando fue ocupada la vacante ya que solo nos tiene en la espera. 
Para esta posicion Engineering Technician Ii (1 De 3) (0000186W). ni siquiera pase a una entevista solo se anuncio y aplique y de ahi en mas no sabemos si ya fue o cupada o que pasaria."
"Siempre he querido vincularme laboralmente en esta empresa desde colombia, en donde me forme profesionalmente en economia y nunca he sido contactada ni en colombia ni aca. Asi que me llegan aplicaciones y postulo pero en realidad no he sido tenida en cuenta ni para una primera entrevista.ni en colombia ni aca en chile donde vivo actualmente."

Show some respect to the candidato and give some feedback 
Show a time line/status process
"Should provide feedback to the candidate, whether or not the candidate continues with the recruitment process."
Should give the opportunity to people who have the experience and have already worked the company
Should give the opportunity for candidates to submit their profile.
"Should be placed in the shoes of aspirants and consider responding eduadamente to professionals of the industry, in my particular case I have 13 years of experience in the pharmaceutical and biochemical industry, J & J considered a more serious company. I have noticed that in Argentina unlike the rest of LATAM the processes are particularly slow.."
Should be more agile when contacting the candidate.
Shortlisting of CVs should be after keenly examining each CV and should not be on the basis of keywords. This would help organization not miss out potential candidates and attract more genuine talent in the organization
"shorten of lapses of evaluation, report evaluation to applicant, provide reason of not fit to the position-"
"Share my professional values ​​and human qualities.
Adapt to the needs of the Company in order to achieve a great success."
"Set up a date to have the selection process concluded and put the following message in the candidature confirmation e-mail: If you don´t receive any information until the date, please consider that you were not selected to the next step."
Set proper expectations to the applicants at all times 
seria realmente bueno si pudieran comunicarse con los candidatos y decirle si quedo seleccionado y si no tambien.
"Seria interessante receber um retorno com os motivos pelo qual não fomos selecionados para participar de outras etapas, visto que o curriculo possuia as caracteristicas solicitadas no anuncio da vaga."
Sería interesante que se comuniquen con el postulante y le den las razones por las cuales no consideran que no es el perfil indicado para la posición abierta.Y ayudarlo a que pueda desarrollar y mejorar todas aquellas oportunidades que consideraron clave para no elegirlo en esta oportunidad y así la próxima esté mejor preparado para una nueva postulación.
"Seria ideal recibir alguna retroalimentacion del proceso de seleccion.
He postulado a varias posiciones en J&J y nunca he sido contactada.

Diante desta explicaçao, não tenho dicas a fornecer como melhorar o processo de recrutamento..."
"Prezados, boa tarde

Para a vaga em questão eu não recebi nenhum feedback, fiz a inscrição pelo site a Johnson & Johnson e fiquei aguardando a resposta positiva ou negativa para vaga em questão, somente agora recebo uma solicitação para participar das pesquisa de satisfação...
Quero deixar claro que em nada diminui o meu pensamento extremamente positivo em relação a compania e agradeço por mais essa oportunidade."

Preguntar a cada aspirante con que experiencia cuenta que máquina maneja si tiene buen trato con el personal a cargo que es muy importante ser un buen jefe porque siendo un buen jefe los colaboradores hacen el trabajo en tiempo y forma

"Praticar o que diz o Nosso Credo, ou seja, não fazer discriminação alguma entre as pessoas, dar oportunidade de, pelo menos as pessoas mostrar seu talento no processo seletivo e, não apenas os indicados pela chefia."
"Practice what you preach, that is, value the professional and not discriminate against people for any reason. I have already applied for several vacancies where my profile was exactly the request for the vacancy and I was not even called to participate in the selection process. It was not a case of non-adherence to the vacancy, but discrimination."
"Potencial prioritariamente el reclutamiento y selección en base del talento de acuerdo a competencias de los postulantes, de forma mas pragmatica, pues, en general, las habilidades blandas y competencias, son mas sencillas de demostrar pragmaticamente que en un documento como el curriculum vitae.
De esa forma, se podria optimizar la experiencia de los candidatos respecto a su representada y la organización podria obtener de primera mano la información necesaria para cubrir la vacante con el mejor talento en competencia."
Possible improvement is a recruitment experience relate to the news or some contact with the prospect. 
Positive and negative Feedback and status during the process steps!

"Poderiam dizer qm qual etapa o processo está, e se á não estamos mais participando, pois tem vagas que me inscrevo e não tenho resposta."
Poderiam dar mais oportunidades para gente que estão cursando técnico e não conseguem um emprego na area. 
Poderia ser exigido apenas o que foi estipulado para o perfil da vaga.Percebo que nos processos seletivos concorrem candidadatos que estão muito mais preparados para um perfil maior que a vaga exige e isso acaba com as chances de quem esta tentando  iniciar sua carreira .
"Poderia informar ao candidato a razão pela qual o seu currículo não foi selecionado para a vaga pretendida.
O candidato sendo informado, ajudaria o mesmo se aperfeiçoando para possíveis vagas futuras."
"Pode melhorando o processo de triagem, devido os filtros cortarem candidatos que tem as características desejadas para a vaga de forma equivocada. Oferecendo oportunidade de feedback para que o candidato saiba o real motivo de não ter sido selecionado."

"Please let the engineers know better about the job and how the process will be lead. I think in Brazil there are many problems in recruiting employees since some people get advanced of knowing people and the process. I have studied in Germany and in Europe the recruitment is clear as well as the open position.
I would like to have an opportunity one day to be part of Johnson & Johnson."
"Please give some real answer/feedback to candidates.
Many companies have the automatic response mail but I would rather receive a mail that inform me if I was ir not considered as well as a person to refer to for follow up."
Please give one chance to prove my skills I want to be a part of Johnson and Johnson I have been applying to Johnson and Johnson for a long period of time but no response coming out...... I am living in UAE but originally I am from Pakistan. Here I have noticed too much politics in the recruitment process.( especially in GCC if you know Arabic then an individual is more likely to get a job in multinational pharma Companies).
"Please give me feedback, Don't know if I missing something"
"Please contact the candidate, either is it for bad or good news."
"Please contact the applicant to inform the status of the position. If there are many applicants, plese fully review each one. It is frustrant not to know if we can be part of the process or not. In my experience, I went to the interview but nothing else happened. I didn´t knew what was the stage or next steps, or if I was not suitable enough... anything!."
"Please be more clear about the reason why I was not selected 

I never recieved an e-mail for interviews, the mail was automatic answer"
Please advise what is the exactly reason for we don't get the job.
"Pleae make it more ""personal""!!. I applied by the recruiting system and after some weeks I only received a letter stating ""after a careful consideration, we regret to inform you  that you have not been selected for this position"".
I was not selected, but I was never contacted by any talent attraction staff member to have a prescreening interview, not even by phone.

Thanks a lot the the interest to improve your recruiting process."
"Pienso que es bueno aparte de hacer sólo pruebas, conocer el candidato y saber que puede aportar aparte de conocer que tiene la aptitud y la actitud para el puesto solicitado. Que es bueno dar oportunidad para adquirir experiencia y poder crecer dentro de la compañía y como persona."

Personally interview
"Personally I would like to provide feedback on the reasons why one does not meet the profile you want. Fortunately another pharmacist gave me the opportunity to collaborate as MSL, however I am intrigued because with you I did not even get a call, while for the other pharmacist I turned out to be the ideal MSL."
Personally i think the process works very good. 
Personalizar el proceso .
Personal interwiew
"Personal interviews are a must

Personal contact. Not just a standard mail sent to the candidate

Personal contact would improve the process.
Personal contact would be fine.
Personal Contact
"Perhaps, some information was lost in the way, but, I´d much appreciate if a feedback was given.
I sent a couple of emails to the recruiter and never heard back.
Before this position, I did a process with J&J - unfortunately wasn´t picked-  but the recruiter and J&J updated me on the process.
Thanks for listening and I hope J&J continues to improve.
Kind regards"
Perhaps to be faster in application answering (negative or positive).
Perhaps recommend a position compatible with the curriculum.
Perhaps J&J must be more friendly to answer what's the problem . The normal answer not correspondence whith the process. There isn't an interview to cualified . 
People should attend an interview. I did not receive any job information.
"Penso que a Johnson & Johnson é uma das  melhores empresas para o colaborador atuar.
I think Johnson & Johnson is one of the best companies for the employee to act."
Passar um feed back melhor ao candidato.
"Passar o currículo enviado diretamente para o gestor responsável pela área demandante, de forma que não fique restrito a análise de um profissional de RH que seja limitado a ver as habilidades e experiências do profissional, principalmente se o mesmo for sênior!"
"Passar ao candidato o principal ponto onde o mesmo precisa melhorar, para que este possa melhorar para eventuais processos seletivos."
Pass on the feedback the reason for not choosing the candidate for the position.
"Para que ocorra o melhor processo de recrutamento seletivo o profissional do RH/Seleção, deveria se atentar as experiencias profissionais do candidato junto à vaga proposta.
O que é notório é que muitas das vezes o recrutador se prende as palavras ""chaves do descritivo"" e não têm conhecimento do real mecanismo da vaga a ser preenchida, não dando a devida oportunidade de entender o que realmente o candidato que esta á sua frente conhece e agregará em sua contratação. Perde assim, um ótimo por que não dizer, um excelente candidato (a).  "
"Para a melhoria do processo seria interessante a J&J citar também em que assunto o candidato será avaliado. A avaliação pela qual passei incluiu disciplinas variadas que, a meu ver, poderiam ser citadas antes da avaliação para auxiliar o candidato no preparo para ser avaliado."
Overall the process is good. 
"oui...vous recommandiez famille
thanks...

Os extremely import the recruiter inform why the candidate is not good enough to the job 
Optimizar tiempo de respuesta

"Open positions for elderly, experienced people."
Only with a call or email with final response. 
"Only experienced professionals are recruited. While I do not have APM experience, I have worked as a commerical and I am an APM graduate, but I have never agreed to an interview. Undoubtedly, they will only recruit people from other laboratories, with vices and bad habits."
One should not tell the candidate that he will be called to participate in the next selection stage and then he will receive an email thanking the attendee and selecting the candidate without having a chance to show his potential.
"One person keep in Touch with me

"One of my big dreams is to belong to the Johnson & Johnson family, I have tried to participate in several processes, however, I have never been selected despite the fact that I comply with the required profiles lately, I distrust the process since only four times I received an email commenting that I have not been selected but I have never received feedback from any recruiter."
"Once the candidate perfectly fits the job description and requisites, the candidate should be at least called for an interview."
"On my third interview, the interviewer was surprised to see that I had no experience in the industry. So, I was wondering... did someone at any point took the time to read my resumé?"
On line tests could open more opportunities for a wide range of professionals with a multidisciplinary backgound.

As provas teóricas de acordo com a vaga e há também a questão de quando não for selecionado a equipe lhe envia um email agradecendo a sua participação e pedindo para que não desista das próximas vagas, isto é um exemplo de equipe de recrutadores ....Para a minha pessoa não tem que melhorar apenas manter este carisma e responsabilidade com os candidatos..

Gostaria de ter recebido uma outra chance para fazer o teste e participar do processo, infelizmente não foi possível."
O never received a feedback regarding my processo so far ...
"O feedback no meu processo seletivo foi dado de forma reativa, apenas após um contato por e-mail, mas na minha opinião para candidatos que foram convidados para entrevista o feedback deveria ser ativo."

In this specific hiring process, recruiter said me they would consider me for the next phase after new years eve. After one month, I sent him an e-mail asking for further information and then on the same day, I received an automatic message thanking me for the participartion. Conclusion: He forgot about providing a feedback for me and only remebered after receiving my follow up e-mail. But also, he didn't invest 2 minutes to write down an e-mail, he simply shooted an automatic message."

Obrigado. "

Gostaria muito de participar em alguma vaga na região de São José dos ampos.
Agradeço a oportunidade.

"Não cheguei a ser convidado para um processo seletivo, então não sei como opinar."
"Não cheguei a fazer um processo na Johnson e Johnson ainda, então não saberia o que melhorar."
nada. impecable todo. muchas gracias.
nada a declarar
"Na verdade fiquei em dúvida com relação ao recrutamento enviei um email e até o momento não obtive resposta. Fui pré selecionada para a vaga e não consegui acessar o site para terminar de responder o que era solicitado para etapa seguinte de seleção, pois não veio uma senha no meu email (estava em branco no password) e quando tentava entrar com a minha senha do sistema, dava acesso negado."
"Na verdade a empresa poderia investir mais em recrutamento, aumentando a produção e o quadro de funcionário."
"Na minha opinião, o processo seletivo,deveria ser mais especifico,uso como exemplo a vaga para técnico de enfermagem do trabalho.
Nós temos conhecimentos assistenciais e ocupacionais,alguns se destacam mais na área assistencial, porém existem aqueles candidatos que dominam a parte ocupacional,gostaria de sugerir que o lado ocupacional fosse mais explorado.
Agradeço de coração a oportunidade.
Não vou desistir da vaga, quem sabe num futuro bem próximo eu seria a candidata com perfil selecionado para vaga.Devemos acreditar nos nossos sonhos.Abraços a equipe."

"n general, today we are experiencing a period of recession in all companies.
I think, Jonhson should be a bit less demanding about the requirements to apply for a position.
I have 30 years of experience in laboratory production, research, development, team management, consulting and even then, I have never been qualified for any of the dozens of vacancies I applied for.
Excuse me, but are there so many hires for Human Resources, who do not even know what to do?
And the production?
And the billing?
What about employee performance?

This is my opinion."
N A
My suggestion is to provide at least one automatic email to the candidates who were not selected to the next phases
"My resume was screened upon application and did not have a chance to interact with a recruiter. Despite this, I am grateful that I was provided feedback, even if only an automated message.  "
"My opinion it's good
Because there are many companies that do not even send email thank you for registering."
My only concern is about the time for send some answers for the candidate and specially for send a negative return and not just the positive return. It's is important for the candidate understand why we were not in a good fit for the position.
"My inglish is poor su please forgive my mistakes.
The recruiter never got in touch with me and this isn't the first time I apply to a job post. I have job alets for Johnson & Johnson/Janssen and in Mexico it seems that there not aware of the web site.
Thanks for taking my comment."
"My dream is to work at Johnson & Johnson, learn and grow with this company and add value with my work. I worked at Pfizer, Astrazeneca and Abbott.
I once received a call from J & J Human Resources, but I was never invited to a job interview.
"
"My CV had ALL alignment to the position with all requirements and background expertise, however I did not get even a simple phone call to explain why I was not a fit, and that is not the first time Recruitment Team at J&J act like that, for other positions I have also applied the same behavior happened, so I am literally given-up on J&J as this is not the company (as an HR professional) I want to be part of."
muy bueno.
muy buena.
Must to talk with the candidates.
Must to talk with the candidate.
"Muchas gracias por tenerme encuenta,
En todo caso sigo trabajando con mucho agrado dentro de J&J Colombia."

"Meu nome é Adrian Siqueira, sou a quinta geração de Joseense, meu bisavô foi um dos fundadores da unidade daqui de São José dos Campos, meus tios, primos, amigos, muitos conhecidos trabalham nesta empresa no qual sonhei toda minha vida em trabalhar mas nunca tive oportunidade. Meu avô Braz Alves de Siqueira Filho dedicou sua vida inteira nesta empresa, e alguns meses antes do José Cividanes se aposentar, implorou para que me desse um voto de confiança para que eu pudesse mostrar meus conhecimentos adquiridos tomando sempre como horizonte a Johnson's.
Sou formado em Comércio Exterior com MBA em Gestão de Empresas pela FGV, cursei Ingles durante 11 anos no Yázigi, procurando sempre evoluir para que um dia eu pudesse contribuir para a empresa. Aos 16 anos participei de um processo para estágio na empresa, porem na terceira etapa acabei não sendo selecionado, gostaria de voltar no tempo para que eu pudesse fazer tudo de outra forma para agarrar com todas as forças essa vaga. Depois disso sempre me cadastrei em diversas vagas, me pego sempre na esperança um e-mail dizendo que eu fui selecionado para a próxima etapa mas infelizmente só recebo respostas negativas, hoje estou com 24 anos é me imagino como seria minha vida se dentro deste tempo eu trabalhasse na Johnson e Johnson ouvindo as histórias de meu avô de como a empresa foi uma mãe para toda minha família."

It seems to me that they have very cold processes.
The searches look like an attempt to promote the company.
When they require staff, I believe they do it through HR consulting services.

Me parece que sería importante tener la posibilidad de ser entrevistado cara a cara sería muy importante

"Maybe, J&J could be review the response time between each interview according to the recruiting process."
"Maybe tell ""us"" What you are looking for , sometimes We can't explain in a peace  of papper (curriculum) our experience and qualities, "
maybe some previous interaction with the participant before to decided that it is not fit

"Maybe saying specifically what is the reason for not accepting the candidate profile, and not only simply saying you are no fit the caracteristics of the position, in other words, ""Your knowledge in laws is not so strong, you have no the desirable experience in compliance, whatever, being more specific"", once the major feedbacks bring us an idea of ""you are not fit the carasteristics of the position"", with almost the same common description of other companies.

Jonhson & Jonhson is a strong brand, needing be different, it´s my opinion."
"maybe personal communication related to strenghts and weakness of my profile

Maybe optimize the process so results can be shown and communicated faster. Since my application I have not had any communication regarding the process. (MSL)
"Maybe only send information about the recruitement process. 

Recruiters need to understand that for those who are unemployed, even a negative response makes a lot of difference. This shows the level of respect the company gives its employees.

Maybe more contact with the applicants for a job.
Maybe JYJ could have a closer approach with the postulant. For example: by telephone.
Maybe just and email confirming that you are not anymore into selection process
Maybe Johnson & Johnson could avoid sending this kind of survey to candidates that haven't even been noticed that their application was no longer under consideration.
Maybe is necessary more human contact. 
"Maybe have something for Veterans who are trying to get a job with your company. I applied for Supply Chain Manager and I understand that for this job, the company would rather hire someone who has civilian experience than 20 years of military service (8 in Supply-Logistics)"
Maybe give an enterview in order to know the candidate.
Maybe do phone call
"Maybe by making phone calls to the candidates to talk and make some questions, telling that it is only a research, with not ensuring the job vacancy, so that the recruiter can feel the interest of the candidate also his situation, intention and plans."
"Maybe be clear since the very beginning, due to I felt like I was a candidate only to comply with a policy of searching for ""an external"" alternative, but the job was already reserved for someone from inside the organization."
Maybe an automated response to the people involved notifying the results.
Maybe a feedback you consider or inputs on why a person can not match with job opportunity posted. Cheers; CS.
May be to have some comunication by phone.
"May be to have a better communication with candidates that want to collaborate and add value to J&J. In my case, I am an experienced professional that already worked for J&J 20 years ago and expected a different treatment. I am sure that this bad communication was part of a misunderstanding and I am still very enthusiastic in having the chance to work again for J&J in the near future. All the best."

"Maintain communication with prospects, and if they meet the desired profile, channel them in other areas or departments"
Maintain as much as possible Job/Submission status updated at jnjc.taleo.net.
"Maintain a clear communication on the process status, at least for internal applicants, I believe this is a form to respect internal applicants and show that the process is fair and communicated accordingly"
"Looking for a job is not a easy task.  Not only you are professionally exposed to show your best, but also you get a lot of expectations wondering what it would be to work on a new team in a big company, specially if you are and enthusiastic daydreamer.  Getting rejected is to face disappointment and it hits you, both on a professional and personal way.  We have all been on that position.  With a strong heart you shake sadness and continue looking, but sometimes it hits you a little harder.

Applying to a job, sometimes is like sending a message in a bottle into the ocean, and if you are unemployed, that can turn into a lot of bottles.  But hardly anyone answers, at least to acknowledge you have been read.  

I really expect some feedback on what went missing from my profile to fit the role, specially from the professionals of a big company such as J&J.  I know it is not your responsibility, but maybe, just maybe it would be a part of your social commitment and that will help building a better career for the ones that would love to work with you to get somehow more competitive on the difficult job market."
Look more into their prospective employees. I lived in the United States for 20 years my level of English is higher then most people you will find here yet wasn't selected for the process. I have 5+ years of customer service expirence.

Living in a competitive world as we do now it is enough to say that Johnson & Johnson is the better place to work at any time. I think myself Johnson & Johnson does the way.
"Little more detail on feedback. I know you probably receive a huge number of CV's and its almost impossible to answer all of them, but its always nice to receive feedback. 
Majority of companies don't even send email informing that you are not suitable for the position. I think that J&J is already at a higher level due to this."
Listen to the candidates in person

Let us know if we are still in the process. I have not heard back from HR but after getting this survey I don't know if I am still being considered or not.

Let people know why they were chosen or not for such position.
Let people know why is not a professional  profile suitable for a job vacant. 
Let me know what happened.
Let candidates know if they have been selected or not
Less questions and more personal contact with the people
"Less favoritism and more talent, would be the best thing for your company!"
"Less automatic process to rule out candidates early in the process without considering at least a phone interview, particular for senior positions."
"Leave the candidate aware of the stages of recruitment because after the candidate signs up, he will have a feddback when the process is over if he has not been selected."
"Las plataformas de reclutamiento por internet son muy distantes e impersonales, y la evaluacion solo se basa en datos puntuales de la Hoja de vida, cuando el candidato posee mas que experiencia, actitudes y aptitudes para ofrecer a una vacante"
"Lamentablemente no tengo buenas experiencias en mis postulaciones, tengo 11 años de compañía y me siento destartalado por el sector de reclutamiento, hasta me invitaron a que no me postules más, el feedback nunca existe, no me parece sería la gente que maneja él área, en esta última búsqueda recibí una respuesta VÍA email y la verdad que la agradecí ya que me sorprendió la respuesta, me considero capacitado y apto para desempeñar mi rol en otras franquicias de la compañía, por eso pido la chance de poder participar activamente de las búsquedas, sino no tiene sentido que pidan experiencia en hematologia y las búsquedas las reciben gente de consumer que es obvio que no tendrán los skills necesarios para la posición. o enterarte que piden experiencia en quirófano y después tomaron una persona de finanzas cuando pedían experiencia de mínimo 3 años en ventas, me parece poco serio, y por lo menos se debería unificar criterios y que sea parejo para todo el mundo."
"Lamentablemente no he tenido la oportunidad de ser entrevistado personalmente, por lo que me da la sensación de no creer en estos procesos en linea, ya que siempre he sido rechazado, me gustaría poder tener una entrevista personal y así me conocieran de mejor manera."
Lack of feedback
"lack of communication, I never received any feedback"
l think I could take in to account the attitudes of each postulator and that these can only be seen beyond the direct interview. 
"Knowledge of the skills of their candidates, giving them opportunities and not just interviewing via computer."

JOHNSON JOHNSON NEEDS to GIVE MORE & OPPORTUNITY for who EVER WORKED THERE
"Johnson is a great company to work, maybe the recruitment should be more attention with candidate, and call to another position that they have in 3 companies ( medical, services, consumer). There is a opportunity in wharehouse located in Guarulhos, Itapevi , but unfortunately I have no success with them.
"
"Johnson can facilitate your recruitment process by giving us the opportunity to deliver our direct curriculum vitae to the company itself, as well as facilitating the hiring of newly trained people to train trainees for the job market.
And johnson can have a great concept of partnering with foreign language schools, in order to garrison their employees in a slightly higher degree of learning."
"Johnson and Johnson need to verify the recruitment process, now in juarez they only hires friends or familiars, and don't give a chance to highly skilled people to be hired "
Johnson and Johnson is doing great in terms of interview for the new candidates for the position. 
"Johnson &Johnson could give feed back to candidates, even it´s only not approved."
"Johnson & Johnson should not change anything, maybe a few small details, such as giving the post or possibly if there are certain possibilities of taking this or that post."
Johnson & Johnson should contact all occupants on the process before sending the message about the feedback.
"Johnson & Johnson should communicate with the candidate, It is Important know the reason why you weren't good fit, because these comments can strengthen skills candidate"
"Johnson & Johnson should be more personally involved on your part, but it is a mailing for failure and thank you. I believe that there are people at a certain level of the Company, who should appear, of course at the crucial moment of hiring, and give guidelines about what is missing or what is your deficit for the role but that is how to take it. To this they do not have to take it to lower the possible salary that they are going to pay by the deficiency of some or that part of the CV, but to incentivize the possible future employees."

"Johnson & Johnson recruitment process was very disappointing. Since I started my MBA I talked with many people that JnJ was one of my top companies and my friends in the MBA were unanimous: JnJ is great place to work but their recruiting process is awful. I gave the company the benefit of doubt, because it is such a great company, but now that I'm getting to the end of my MBA and can confirm: recruiting process at JnJ is terrible. I have, at least, 8-9 people in my MBA program that would say the same.
This year, for the IRDP program, the company sent periodically an automatic message saying that they were reviewing my application, which I initially thought that was a good thing, because last year, for the internship, nor even this message we got. But as time went by I saw that the company doesn't care about candidates at all, because I just received and answer that I would not be considered for the position anymore when I sent an email for 4 recruiter in Brazil. If the company already had that answer why don't keep candidates posted. For positions in US I always received answers, for the IRDP program. Neither I or any of my friends were happy with the process. That's so sad. I company like JnJ should improve this. "
"Johnson & Johnson need improve its communication process with candidates. Rather than only send a sorry email. It is necessary tell them why they were refused, and what they need to do for be considered another time."
Johnson & Johnson might contact the recruiter to explain why is not the persona that they are looking for.
Johnson & johnson make prospective employer as highly influenced.
"Johnson & Johnson is not giving me the opportunity to personally introduce you to my professional experience. The company could give more dynamics in  group so that it can know the candidate better.

I would like to have this opportunity.

Best regards.

Johnson & Johnson is a great company. The fact that the recruiting process was not a good experience hasn't changed my mind about the company.
Johnson & Johnson have a good recruitment process.
"Johnson & Johnson for me was always a company that I am looking to be part of it, and i I could receive not an automated answer, but a more personal answer explaining why I don't fit for the company, could be better. I have a very strong experience in Healthcare, and sometimes is difficult to understand why I don't match..."
"Johnson & Johnson did not provided feedback about recruitment process after an online interview with Sonia Azuma, to the position of EHS Engineer. After a few weeks, I asked by e-mail to the recruiter Camila Casaccia if the proccess has had been terminated. She answered that I would be informed about the next steps, what never happened. Two months after the interview I received an automatic e-mail saying that hiring team has chosen not to pursue my candidacy for the positionThis experience shows me that J&J don't respect candidates to their jobs opportunities.

J & J should be transparent regarding the timeline and not give vague answers when asked about the progress of hiring.

Johnson & Johnson could tell why the candidate didn't get the job
"Johnson & Johnson could receive an e-mail resume from recruitment and selection staff.
It should give more opportunities for personal interviews, because through these electronic media it seems that we are in relationship with robots.

The true professional potential of a person has to be evaluated face to face."
Johnson & Johnson could provide more analytical feedback than the candidate needs to get the job
"Johnson & Johnson could provide a feedback to appliers that did not approved after interview. Now, J&J send an automatic messenger to communicate a negative answer. But, I believe it would be intersting if J&J show to appliers how to improving technical and personal skills."
"Johnson & Johnson could first interview the candidates to identify the candidate's profile and withdraw the best that the candidate can offer to the company.
I have very interested in joining this wonderful company. My greatest goal to be part of this team and contribute to the growth of this company.

Thanks.

Best Regards.

"Johnson & johnson could contact the candidate, giving feedback on the selection process, because I did not receive any information and I was not called to interview."
Johnson & Johnson can to provide to the candidate a reason why doesn't a good fit for the position applied.

Johnson & Johnson can push the recruiter to respond for yes and for no to every applicant. So you can relax and know why you did not fit in with the position.

There are many techies on the market that would like to have more opportunities to join a great company like Johnson & Johnson."
"Johnson & Johnson at least took the time to let me know I was not selected for the position I was applying to.  Many other organizations do not take that into consideration for their recruitment process.

"Johnson & Johnson  should gives feedback to candidate, , about the reason why he was not accepted "
Johnson & Johnsn could offer  more personal interviews at the aspirants.
Job interviews
JNJ should improve the way that the the feedback services are given. It could be great to have more information about why the profile of the candidate it hasen´t been successful.
"JnJ should give more consideration to the online job applicants based on their merits and experience rather than inviting candidates who are applied or referred by internal recommendation. The response time from JnJ is extremly long and most of the time receiving only a rejection of the job application by email, I really wonder the decision is taken by the respective hiring line manager or by the HR representative!..I like to request JnJ to make more consideration and review the candidate resume for their educational qualification, experience, other credentials, etc. and then invite them for an interview rather than rejecting the job application at the first instance...hope to get more positive response from JnJ and looking forward to attend an interview in the near future for some of the roles that I have applied to show my mettle to the hiring team, as JnJ is one of my choice employer. Thank you"
"Jamas dan una respuesta, ni favorable ni no favorable."
"Já participei de alguns processos da Cia, alguns em que cheguei até a final inclusive, porém não recebi nenhum feedback em relação ao meu desempenho, e o motivo pelo qual optaram por outro candidato. Recebi somente o e-mail automatico.

Na maior parte dos casos eu fui atrás do feedback (visto que entendo a importancia do mesmo para o meu desempenho e para manter minha motivação) , mas acho que seria muito bacana e importante para a imagem da Cia , que o RH já pudesse retornar pro candidato com as informações.

 Não só no meu ponto de vista, mas também no de varias pessoas com que conversei (que ja participaram de algum processo na Cia) o e-maisl automatico é muito impessoal.

J&J should monitoring the discrimination against senior professionals.
J&J should let the candidate know the steps (w/ the planned schedule) of the recruitment process
"J&J should improve the recruitment process. I am one of the thousands of people who do not get any answers.
The number of rejections are very high. In my opinion, it does not add any value for anyone to apply on line as we do not get any chances at all.

This is actually pretty sad. I am completely discouraged with the online job search. Not only that, but I am really embarrassed to recommend people because they have got very discouraged at all. And for the ones who are called, the recruiters do not even have telephone numbers in Bogota- Colombia and when they interview people, they only say, they wanted to get to know them to put the CV on the database. That is really a waste of time for everyone involved in the process."
"J&J Recruitment Team should to contact via email or phone to all people involved in the process; in my personal experience, this is the first email that I received from you when you says thanks you for apply and please help us with this survey, so .....

I personally always felt admiration for J&J and desire to work inside of the Biggest Company, but sincerely I think that you need to improve the recruitment process in order to avoid possible feeling conflict like my case.

Thanks,

Ingrid Plummer "
"J&J recruitment process is quite organize and straight forward.
As an aspirants like me looking for opportunity in your company, your notification is a good way to show transparency."
"J&J recruiters should give feedback, not only send an automatic email message."
J&J process is very well dine
J&J needs to improve their communication with candidates.
J&J might to give more opportunity to people outside the company.
"J&J is strongly known worldwide as a great company, especially by the high quality of its products, but regarding its recruitment process I've got too disapointed, since I received a phone call from an intern about my application and no more information or contact, just an e-mail after sometime saying the company wouldn't pursue my candidacy. See that I'm not disapointed not to be chosen for the job vacancy, but with the way recruitment process was conduct.
So, basically the process was not followed."
"J&J is a great company, however in the opportunities that I applied I did not receive any feedback or even any contact from a Recruiter. I really don´t know exactly the reason why, but I would like to have some feedback about the processes, negative or positive are consequences of my profile and the job opportunity, but to listen it from an internal Recruiter can help to improve the professionals profiles and, of course, the recruitment process.    "
"J&J could improve the evaluation and the feedback, so the applicants to the job could know wich points need improvement, where they failed and liked the company."
J&J could give me an opportunity to participate in an job processe that my career fits in.
J&J could give me an opportunity to participate in an job processe that my career fits in.
J&J could give me an opportunity to participate in an job processe that my career fits in.
J&J could give me an opportunity to participate in an job process that my career fits in.
J&J could give feed back to candidates.
"J&J could explaing the reasons that a Candidate were not a a good fit for the company. Ex.: others candidates hás knowledge of germany language, that was a diferencial the job."
"J&J could call to explain what happened. I have the profile correct, so I would like understand why I didn't receive a call."
J&J can to do more friendly if communicate the reason which 
"J&J can improve: more accurate deadlines and feedback for candidates who were interviewed

It's important to note that the recruiter who conducted my phone interview was very kind and I believe he received an overwhelming amount of resumes. Therefore, giving feedback for every interview can be very hard. "
J&J can give for candidates a feedback about process.
J&J can contact in order to give atatus on the selecting process.
J &J can to approach a little bit with the candidates. Besides they can let us know every step of the process 
"J & J should call or at least send an email informing you that the postulant has not been selected because it is not the profile you are looking for.

Other things would be that the recruiter can give a hope and mention in which areas best fits his profile. In this way, the applicant will feel important because at least they have read your CV."
"J & J never called me to an interview, I have good experience and requirement to position, I always get this message ""your resume has not been selected"". I believe that the recruitment from Brazil is not selecting according to the experiences and qualifications of the candidates, they prefer to hire with indications from officials, friends or relatives. This hampers the discovery of new talent as well as being detrimental to the candidates who can add to the company. "
"J & J has not contacted me , not even to say I'm not qualified for the position. 
The company must tell the applicants if they are or not fit for the positions. So we won't be expectant."
I´ve never seen a such good recruitment process as JnJ process. However I think that in this particular case the process was not the expected one. I didn´t receive any contact.
I´ve never been contacted
Í´ve been trying for years and in my humbold opnion people with such a persistent position should be reconsidered for a vacancy..
I´m still waiting for the R P
"I´d like to suggest some questions regarding the job offer, in way to help candidates to  show their experience and knowledge regarding the function requests."
"I`m Luciana Miarelli I would like to stay at Johnson, because I belive that the company is the best local to work in São Jose dos Campos, Brazil. "
Its ok!
Its my first selective process. But I consider respectful all feedbacks ! Positive or negative. I hope work in Johnson soon !! 
"It's too difficult to get a job in this company. I'll love to work in johnson, but, maybe I need to still waiting."
it's okay
It's ok as is.
"It's nice to fill this surveys, but also response for the applications are needed.

Also a feedback (face to face is possible) on why someone wasn't elected and areas for improvement would be very helpful and at least, in my opinion, valuable for future applications."
"It's necessary to provide a reason why we were not a good fit for the position we applied to.
"
It's necessary to give one feedback.
It's is difficult to do a survey when you haven't experience any interaction.
It's important to provide feedback
It's important to provide a feedback. I never got one about the process
It's important to give a feed back about the process.
"It's important give feedback to candidates, inclusive from the beginning when candidate submits the application and if,  CV does not fit with the profile, please revert with info. Besides, I think J & J is a recognized company around the world and it would be great receive some insights about our profile. "
It's great
It's Good 
"It's a pity that J&J only accepts Biingual Executive Assistants with University Degree than because of  their experience and skills.   I consider that J&J is a company which is not inclusive because it also matters the age.  In my case, I have all the requirements and experience since I was the assistant to the Vice President Sanofi Pasteur Latm for many years and wasn't consider for the position.  J&J only sends a non-reply message, thanking for the interest in the company and that another profile was choosen."
"It's a little frustrating cannot talk to real people, I only received automated emails and at the end it's my career what we're talking about. So I still thinking  Johnson & Johnson it's a  really great company with a huge brands, should be more one on one at the recruitment procees. 

Kind Regards!"
It's a bit impersonal. But I understand the filter big companies have to implement in order to initially sort candidates. 
It'd be great if J&J could give a properly feedback to the candidate regarding the reason ehy he isn't in a good fit
It would give a feedback to those that apply for an opportunity to collaborate with its professional team by explaining the reason why the applying process did not proceed instead of saying only that the position was already fulfilled.
"It would de Nice to hace dime feedback, ir even just been said it is no longer available."
It would be very nice to understand why you where not chosen and help by pointing out any opportunity areas to improve.
It would be very good to improve the response times for us applicants to job offers
It would be really nice if they could be a little more specific about what the candidate was not a good fit for the job. But I was very pleased to know that I was actually evaluated.
It would be really interesting and appretiate a feedback for the position I applied to.
It would be nice to understand why you where not chosen at this moment.
"It would be nice to understand the reason I was not a fit to the open position I have applied. thanks, "
It would be nice to recieve a call or any kind of interest from the recruiter.
"It would be nice to receive an email informing why the candidate is not selected or at least if the process is closed or not.  Many thanks for considering me for this survey.
Regards,"
It would be nice to know why the candidate did not get the job.
It would be nice to hear back from the recruiter either for a negative or a positive answer. I never recived either of them.
"It would be nice to have a feedback on why there was not a fit to the position. Regards, Manuela"
It would be nice to give some job-application feedback. 
"It would be much appreciated that the recruiter, contact the person who is applying for the job why they didn't get it."
"It would be kind of you to either Contact candidates or close your requisition. 

But don't leave people stranded  without information. 

 Of course we all know that if you are not called, chances are you didn't get the job or will not get it. But by sending the computer - generated humane message, at least you are not left to wonder. 

My children have used Johnson and Johnson products and so have I. Your brand is highly respected. I would have loved to work for you.

"
It would be interesting if Johnson & Johnson actually contacted the unsuccessful candidates for the vacancy in which you applied to inform us why we were not selected. I would like to be informed so that I can better my abilities or better suit the company's profile.

"It would be interesting if J&J demonstrates attention to the candidates, e.g. talking to them at least by phone to explain, in just a few words, the reason why the candidate cannot continue in the recruitment process and if the position was fulfilled with internal or external candidate."
It would be great if you can provide a quick email with the status
It would be great if johnson & johnson could give a properly feedback to the candidate regarding the reason why he isn't a good fit
It would be great if candidates would receive feedback.
It would be Goodyear to have more feedback about the recruitment process. 
"It would be good to receive the status of the process and the pros and cons to fit the position. This will serve to improve, not only the recruiter process but the applicant aproach. Regards."
It would be fine to receive an email to know you are not considered to continue in the process.
"It would be better to interview first the applicant rather than not interview initially at all. There are applicants that are more likely to have something better than what the company is looking for. Personally, I have not received even a phone call interview for the position I applied before. An applicant may not have the same position as the job requirement but for sure, the person has the idea."
"It would be better if you reply by an email or another way that you were not selected, in that way at least you know they got your CV..."
It would be better a short recruitment process and more feedback to all candidates during and after the process
It would be a good idea that the recruiter would have contact me and provide a reason why I were not a good fit for the position I applied to
It will be good to know what are the final results after all the process. It has been almost 2 months since I got any news from the recruitment team.
"It was very impersonal.
"
It was really good to receive an email about the process status.
"It was greath 

No aditional comments by my self

Regards"
It was a very nice first interview but then the contact was only by email. 
"It was a very long time before receiving any feedback, it makes you think it is not an option anymore and take some other opportunity.

The whole process feels very unpersonal. It would be best to have at least one personal email in response.

Thank you"
"It was a good company to do an a interview, because the HR call to me and spent some time to hear about my experiencie,
We know that in Brazil, it´s not so common now a days. 
Thanks the oppportunity, and I hope one day I will work in this big company. 
Bianca "
"It took so long for J&J to come back that I even forgot about this application. It was literally months to get an answer for what seems to be an old position and the answer was just ""thank you but no thank you"". 
However is the  3rd email I receive to do a survey for a process that didn't happen!
I am glad you are trying to fix your process, just focus on execute it and be fast on the candidates. I have a job, I don't apply to positions very often, somehow your add pick my eye. If i were unemployed and were a good candidate, time would have kill the opportunity.
In these days, speed is critical and while I understand Internet is a great tool, always a conversation is better, either video call or just audio.
On the other side, if the positions are open so long, maybe you don't need them in the first place. 
Problem with slow Talent Acquisition in the first approach makes the process slow and impossible to keep up. The first interview didn't even happened! I speculate when a candidate is a fit, it takes months and several interviews before completing. With the market changing so drastically and talent moving fast I imagine is hard to keep up.
The last comment is about the image of J&J, if this process is like this, I don't want to think how other process are in J&J, most likely slow and bureaucratic.  
Look into your internally people and the lower levels...
Hope this helps and I stop receiving e-mail reminders ;-)"
It took a long time between the application and the RH's response (longer than 2 months as i recall). This time could be shorter.
It takes very long until you hear from them.
it should give a feed back about resume submitted.
It seens relationship is the most important skill to progress at j&j
"It seems you provide automatic answer to any application that does not fit exactly the job description published, making almost impossible from people with experience in other industries to advance in the selection process inside J&J. Even that is not an obligation, I sincerely think you are avoiding to gain experience from other businesses that could enhance the company performance. "
"It seems that in spite of you have an internal recommendation from mkt and other areas, the HR is not interviewing people above 35-40 years old. I had heard that they think that an old guy can not respond for a young director. it is a pit."
It seems impersonal
"It seams that there is a digital filter to choose candidates . Even if you were asked for an interview, the negative  response is automatic and without any consideration for the candidate. It does not correspond to the J&J brand. There is a incompatibility between the way the company is seen in publicity and the HR recruitment process . It is disconnected. Sorry to say that, hope you improve the entire process. "
It may be good idea to contact people also in case they are not good fit. At least to avoid false expectations. 
It is very important for the candidate that the recruiter explain a reason and where were the gaps between the position and the candidate's profile. 
"It is very frustrating to get an standard email saying you haven´t been selected after all the effort that takes to look for a job, specially in ones that you have the necessary experience for. No explanation, no reason why is stated. It would be great to get feedback"
It is too impersonal for a company that says it is the opposite 
"It is the second or third time I apply for a HR position at JJ. After some time I only receive an e-mail telling me that I am not eligible for the position. I have two Bachelor's degrees, one MBA degree and I'm taking an International Specialization. I have 20 years of experience in HR management. I was responsible for implementing and conducting all the HR policies and process in my career. I have experience in strategic HR management which means I'm able to perform as a manager connected to JJ ideology. How can they presume I'm not eligible for the position if nobody even talked to me? I know there are dozens of good applicants all around the country. But I have the experience of a senior with the liveliness of a young. Thanks."
It is not clear standards used to approve or not.
It is not clear standards used to approve or not.
It is not clear I am not able to be part of recruitment process.
It is necessary that the company of the return on the selection process for the candidate
"It is important to give what is lack about the profile. I just received the email below without a reason:

We have received your application for the position of GERENTE FINANCEIRO - MAKE-8456161012. After careful consideration, we regret to inform you that you have not been selected for this position.

We will retain your candidate file in our database and may inform you of job openings that match your profile if you selected this option. We also invite you to visit the Career Section on our Web site regularly.
"
It is important to be transparent and give the candidate perspective of the recruitment process. It's only fair. 
"It is difficult to have an opinion since I do not have any experience in the recruitment process at the moment because in the postulations I send I do not have any contact with you, but if you do this type of surveys, I imagine it's a great company that cares By its staff

Mauricio Chanona"
"It is difficult to answer this survey because I have never received a feedback.
I inscribed myself for two different positions and, few days later, I received an e-mail which said that my profile was not good for the opportunities.
I would like to know what exactly in my resume did not match with job description. Thanks."
It is correct the process.
It is always better to hear from the recruiters to get feedback for upcoming interviews.
"It is a very good company, what I would recommend in the selection process is to inform the candidate of how the process is going"
It is a great company and it takes care of informing applicants that they have not been selected to continue in the process. I think the company conducts the process in a professional way. 
"it is a good process , I don´t change nothing. thank you."
It has improved already.
"It has been shown that experience is worth more than a title (s) and therefore the candidate's age is not debatable.

Se ha demostrado que la experiencia vale mas que un título(s) y por consiguiente la edad del candidato no es discutible. "
"It has been a pleasure to apply for a job in JnJ. Howerver, I have not received any feedback from recruitments, even when it is to inform a negative answer. Said that, a follow up of the process would be a great opportunity for improviment. Thanks for the interest in my oppinion and I wish to be part of JnJ team soon."
It could take into account for the positions those candidates who don´t live in the same city where the positions are required but are available to relocate. And also it could give a feedback explaining briefly why the candidate is not considered suitable for the position.
It could reduce the bureaucracy to fill the register for job openings.
"It could make it less complex by eliminating these searches and actually giving a return to the candidate.
"
"It could give to the potential candidate, a comprehensive explanation why the candidate did not fit the positioning offered. By doing this, it may help the professionals, in many cases, on how to better present themselves to J&J, sometimes it is just a problem on how to prepare a good résumè and not because the candidate did not fit the profile required.Another situation, is the ""age problem"". Companies used to say that they do not discriminate candidates age, is it true? I say that because I have a good résumè and have worked many years for an big and important american company, and it seems for me, that sometimes my qualifications and skills are not even read, just because I am in my sixties."
It could give opportunities to people who came from academia
"It could give more chances to people who have not yet had the opportunity to work in the area they studied, I even made several selections and so far I have not had a chance."
It could be valuable to receive a feedback from J&J 
It could be great if the recruitment team take time for make more personal interviews
It could be good to include feedback
It could be a better experience if the recruiter had share information or feedback about the process.
it can provide a more detailed explanation why the candidate was not a good fit for the job he is applying to.
It can make skype interviews... i think
"It can improve the interviewing and selection process, giving professionals the opportunity to defend their knowledge and improve the feedback process with candidates"
"Is very nice that you let know to the candidate when process is closed, it would be great to know why he ir she was not selected."
Is very important that the Recruiter contact people who is applying for a job and provide a reazon why we are not a good fit for the position.
"is very important doing direct communication with the candidate, not only cross information in virtual platform "
"Is the process closed?
This is the 4th email that I receive asking me for a feedback from different positions that I applied to.
I´m assumim the process is closed, due to the first question.
"
"Is important that The Company have a great communication with the candidate, to he feel that he is participative a process of selection

"Is better if you have the oportunutty to know the proccess result with a more human proccess

If you know te Company ( I am ex employee) , based in the credo values, you know that the people is a priority in J&J

Best Regards"
"is actually pretty nice, so i wont change anything 

thanks "
"Is a process that I believe personally, the company has to solve if it wants to  efficiently the recruitment process, in a personal contribution the first step in a recruitment is not having any kind of prejudices to aspire to have a good and stable human capital"

Venho buscando uma oportunidade de trabalho na J&J, mas me sinto excluído, apesar de ter um currículo muito bom, que eu sei que é, mas por preconceito, discriminação, exclusão, eu não tenho uma única oportunidade de sequer participar dos processos. Não adianta nem indicação de colaboradores, que mesmo assim não sou chamado.

Sinto uma tristeza profunda, pois a J&J é a empresa dos meus sonhos, a empresa que sempre esteve na minha vida, mas por causa de pessoas que já estão dentro, meu sonho virou um enorme pesadelo, que dói muito, muito...

"In my opinion if the recruiter could give me an answer about the recruitment process, it would be better."
"In my case, just send my cv, never passed this step of the process"
"In my case no feedback was given on why I was not selected. I only received the automatic e-mail indicating I was not selected, but no feedback on why. As a candidate I think it can be convenient to know the gaps that need to be filled in order to self-improve to best apply for future opportunities.

In my case it is very difficult to see employment opportunities in Ecuador so I want to apply outside of Ecuador. Johnson seems to me an integral company where one can develop professionally
"In my case I would like to speak with someone at Johnson & Johnson in order to know what happened in my process. Please give to me the chance to do it.

"In my case I don't know why I'm not candidate for this position, I would like so much have the opportunity at least of have a interview.
I'm sure of my skills and I think that maybe with the interview, could change the selection."
"In JZ we know Johnson & Johnson and we know how big and talent is this company. Every engineer that I know and staff managers dream to work in your company. I received an email explain me why I was not selected and this is what I expect for your company, profesional but at the same time worry to not impact as a human our feelings.

  Please continue in this way.

  Best regards. Jose."
"In first instance Maybe call by phone the applicant.

"In fact, I have the impression that positions are posted only by formalities, where internal candidates are already chosen. I have 17 years of experience in Supply and Logistics, I have always worked in large companies like Pfizer and Astrazeneca and until now I have never been contacted for any position that I have applied for, strange."
"In fact, I had the opportunity to be contacted twice by the recruiters of the company and in both cases explained how the selection process would be. Unfortunately in one of the opportunities the professional called me but could not talk to me and because of this simple fact I was no longer able to participate in the interview, I believe that a greater importance given to health professionals would be interesting because we are not an object.I believe very much in the potential of the professionals of the Health and medical devices because they are very delicate products and of high added scientific value. In addition, the company is excellent and maybe one day it will be part of the staff, leveraging the sales of JeJ, spreading commitment and quality throughout the country.

In fact I found the process for recruitment professional and influencing enough especially comparing to other similar career websites. Paying attention to newly graduates and asking for their opinions are always good first impressions for everyone. 
"In Chile, they don't provide any feedback. I did a case study/interview for another position and I never even got a ""thank you but no thank you."" It's very prevalent in Chilean culture but as an American company, with all due respect, I expected more decency from the HR department."
"In case, I was eliminated in the initial process, I think by the electronic system, so I could not have a conversation with the recruiter. I understand the need for this selection, but I think if I had the opportunity to face a person I would have done very well. But anyway, I'll keep trying."
"In case that the candidate wouldn't be the chosen one, at least send an e-Mail explaining the reasons for not"
"in case of not being in the requested vacancy, give us feedback enque are failing.
also the because we don't pass the RH filter, there are colleagues who apply and not talk to them.

Thank you very much to be on the lookout for human talent."
"In all moment Johnson & Johnson to improve reasons or points in each step of the interview, but in the final decision Johnson & Johnson send to me a email but the reasons wasn´t clear, I feel desmotivation for the little explication and I thought that Johnson & Jonson call me, final process wans´t clear and explained  "
"In addition to claify the position profile, please consider that it is important to let us know to which pay grade may we apply, since, according to the recruiter not all the positions are available to all employees, that is, there are positions where the pay grades are an important filter to continue within the process. 
An example of this would be ""THIS POSITION IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES within a pay grade 24""      "

"If you require feedback you should provide feedback, I just received an email saying that J&J no longer will continue with my application, no feedback at all, I understand that you may have too much rejected applicants; however you are also planning time to review surveys from rejected applicants.

In other words it is clear for me that yo are only interested in your process.

Hope this helps."
"If you could send an email with the reasson why you are not the ideal candidate, it would be a good feedback for us."
"If they are bringing down the application, applicant should know the reason and the improvements and skills the candidate is still required for the job should be given properly."

"I've got experience working as IT auditor, IT infrastructure analyst and IT support analyst, I applied for 2 positions and the recruiter did not contact me to provide a reason why I was not a good fit for these 2 positions , even an email has been sent to me. 
During the interview with recruitment team, seemed to me you guys did not accept 2 applications for different positions even both are under technology division, it would be good to inform candidates the limit of applications that applicants  could apply at the same time.
Anyway, Brazil's jobless rate hits nearly 13 million unemployed, I think it is kind impossible to reach all applicants with different feedbacks, probably you guys will have to hire a guy just to do that, could be me? :-)"

I've been trying for years to move forward in every process and many times the job requirements and my profile seems to have a match. I think the company should be more open to explain better the requirements so I wouldn't be applying so often with high expectation.
"I'm very said about the process that I tried participated... I fulfilled my experience at the form, I known that I haved the experience asked and in after some hours I receive a mail with the information that I'm not selected...
I'm really fell that a computer analysis some information and send the email... "
"I'm really disappointed, because I've never received a feedback on this process. I tried to reach the recruiter several times, but she never answered me. I really recommend you to contact a candidate if you can give a feedback on the process. "
I'm quite sure that your hiring team can badly read a CV.
"I'm ok with the e-mail I've received telling me that I was not selected for the position. It's good to hear back, not only positive answers. Thank you!"
I'm ok with it the way it is
I'm not sure if sending this survey to people that has not been contacted for a personal interview is a good idea 
"I'm interested in being part of J&J's family that's why I decided to apply for an open position however I was not contacted/called by a recruiter, I just received and email where I was informed the position was covered."
"I'm confused about this survey, I was not called or interviewed"
"I'd like to thank the email and the chance to participate on the survey, but I this is the first time I hear from JJ after I applied for the position.
So, I'm learning that I was not considered just now.
I'd like to reinforce that my experience and skill sets can greatly benefit JJ. Looking forward to upcoming job opportunities.

"I'd like to know why my experience was not suitable for the position I applied for. If so, if I am over or under qualified for the job. Or even if my salary expectations were also an obstacle regarding the arranging of a job interview in order to deepen my job history."
"I' m an ex employee from Janssen Cilag Brazil , and since I left the factory I disired to return to Jonhnson & Jonhson. I had particular resons to left, and I planned to retun when possible. For a Year I send my inscription for many positions that I fill the profile. I verify that always asked in the form  if I´m an ex employee from Johnson & Johnson. Althoug I have a good professional experience, I was never selected for an interview.  To be an ex employee is something that prevents me from being selected? Shoul I continue apply for future positions?

"I would´ve liked to have a coherent answer from the recruiter, no just a forward email  explaining why I´m not a good fit for the job applied."
"I wouldn´t able to follow the recruitment process, my password was always invalid.
"
I would suggest to explain better to the candidater why he/she are not going to continue to be part of the hiring process.
I would recommend to implement a minimum the 1st question of this survey. FUP will be great.
I would recommend to have a better feedback when we apply to a job position
"I would recommend that the process should be taken more seriously by the people who handle it. 

I received a contact via e-mail from Nicolas Hiroyuki Shinmaru that he would contact me for the position but after i replied his message with the confirmation i would like to participate in the process, no one else replied me. I tried to contact him 3 times (2 telephone calls and 1 via email) but could not have a response back. I was really surprised by the silence and did not understand what happened in background. I just wanted to hear back if i was in the process or not - simple like that. 

Then i received an email message fro the system informing that i was not selected to be part of that recruiting process for this role. I can at least say that the system part of the process is working. 

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain what happened and i hope you can fix that for the next candidates for future job opportunities. 

Regards, 

Lilia Moreira"
I would really like to hear from the recruiter more often. I had to call her to ask for a second interview and I also had to call her to understand how was the process going and I also had to ask for a formal feedback.
I would like you to interview staff one by one for the vacancy. And electronically tell us why and if we were not selected. thank you.

I would like the answer to be more complete. Let the recruiter explain the reason person was not approved according to their qualifications.
I would like that recruitment process call to candidate  to give personally the explanation about some positions......
i would like that JJ can do a call up me 
I would like more if the process would have been more personal
I would like Feedback 
"I would have loved to be interviewed personally by a J&J professional. As senior recruiter I have interviewed hundreds of people of different profiles and seniority and I like to make them feel important to me and to the company, they appreciate it and even my turn down calls are welcome. I pity I had no chance to talk to anyone about my experience and to find a fit with the role. Thank you for the survey."

"I would have liked to get a more personalized e-mail, preferably from the last person that interviewed me. "
I would had been good to be contacted by a recruiter and not just being rejected by email.
I would feel more comfortable if the recruiter could contact me by phone and explained. 
"I would be very nice to receive guidance understanding why I was not considered, it may give me the opportunity to work on developing what ever area I may be lacking. Thanks."
I would be good if the recruiter send a message of feedback about why the prostec was not elegible for the position. I mean if the people has or have the opportunity to be part of the Johnson and Johnson in the future or not.
I would appreciate that someone got in touch with me.

"i wish i could be part of your Johnson & Johnson family, i think is a great place to work because take care of your workers even the people who  wants to be part of your company, i like your recruitment process"
I will like to say that I was interview ando hire on april 2016 to cover a temporal position. Everything went good a that same time another person was hired form a similar position but it turn out that this other person was her best friend and even that this girl didn't had any exprerience and did not speak english our manager decide to keep her. One month later I received antes email with another open position I send my resume hoping to be at  least interview and of course thinking that I can be hired considering that I had experience forma more than 10 years in other companies ando also at J&J. But unfortunatly no one call. I'm still waiting for another opportunitie.
"I welcome the automatic replies to give me a status of the process. But I find it  awkward not to be invited to a second stage beyond the cv submission, ever. I have applied many times over the years. I am sure such a huge company certainly would have a position where I would fit in well, given my background, experience and references. So, it leads me to believe that either the company always looks for the same profile of people, does not bet on different backgrounds, or applicants need to be known by a J&J employee in order to have a chance of an interview at least.  "
"I wasn't interviewed for anyone so in this case I can't give the right score about the process. I strongly would like to have at leat one interview to the recruiter have a chance to know my knowlegde and behaviours, but I understand the process. Hope one day have this change at all. Thanks.  "
"I wasn't informed that I was not good for the position, I discovered it with this survey.

I recommend informing the candidates directly instead of letting them know with e-mails like this."
I wasn't contacted at all... so I can't give an opinion of what I don't know.
I wasn't called to interview process.
"I was so excited to participate in this processes, but unfurtanalley i never got a call to an interview or knowing at what part of the process i was. Until today i dont know ir you have closed the post or if i continue as a candidate.

Surely i will participate in furder posts because i think Johnson & Johnson its a great company to work for.

"I was invited to participate in a face-to-face interview at J&J São Paulo, which never happened. After arriving at the agreed time and date at the company one Monday afternoon, still waiting at reception, I received a call from the recruiter saying that she had forgotten the appointment and that she could not interview me because she was not in the building at that moment. 
She rescheduled the F2F interview to the next Wednesday morning and said that before that, she would call me just to confirm the hour. 
At 11am on Wednesday I received her call saying she would interview me over the phone and started questioning me about a Logistics position. Theoretically, I should be participating to the HR Manager process. When she realized the second mistake, she said she would schedule an interview directly with her boss and let me know the date as soon as possible. I've never been contacted again. 
To improve the recruitment process I strongly recommend structured internal processes, but mainly, well-selected and very well prepared HR professionals. They will help the company to develop the staff and build the future teams that will guarantee excellency.
Despite the facts, I admire the company J & J, its segment and values.
I will be available to help with internal processes, either directly in HR or as Business Partners. 
Thank you for this opportunity to express myself.

"I was interviewed for Supply Chain Manager on Friday, advised a young lady name Edith was going to call me and then set up an appointment with hiring manager the following week. None of this happened. There was a lot I could do to offer Johnson and Johnson. Disappointing

Improve and if told a part of the process was going to happen, please follow through with the process, as we all would expect when hired."
"I was initially selected for the interviews, received some ""on hold"" status by e-mail, but was never contacted for the interviews. "
"I was informed that I was being considered to the position. 
With this survey I am in doubt. 
So I suggest that if the candidate doesn't fit to the position, firstly the recruiter should contact explaining the reason and then sent the survey. "
"I was informed about the opportunity by an employee but the company did not even bother to contact me. As a candidate, I believe that the minimum would be to contact me and check if I have the skills to perform the job. It seems that the recruitment area is solely based on Resumés to decide if candidates are fit or not for the job, which is a huge mistake. As the name says, a Resumé is a small abstract of the candidate's work history and it surely does not include all his knowledge and experience. I feel that J&J is missing on good professionals due to that mistake. Surely enough, I will not apply to any other position in J&J and possibly I will stop buying its products."
"I was indicated in 3 vacancies in johnson and could not fulfill the requirements for the link that I receive from the indication, because the site is always in error, which is a point to be improved and another point would be us candidates to follow the process, or how many Steps are of the selection process, as they pass as steps know whether we were approved or not, have some feedback.


For example now, I only knew that I did't pass for vacancy Planning & Operations Coordinator  because I received this research."
"I was amazed to see that you people do you even read the application! I must be one of the best applicant with academic record and necessary job experience, but never really got a chance to actually talk to any hiring manager. I am sure I will not likely apply again to any job at JnJ."
"I want to say you
Thanks for your attention
I get job already."
"I want some feedback on the process, because the need to know my strengths and my weaknesses in the process to improve my profile for future selection processes"
I want a real feedback of why I wasn't selected
"I waited for more than 2 months just to receive a feedback from the interview with the manager.

I received the feedback in an email with a very vague reason why I was not selected. 

And I just got the answer because I complain about it with a JnJ employee that I know.

For me it was a total lack of respect and I lost all my interest to work for JnJ.

"I understand the demand outweigh the offer and you have thousand of applicant for any opening. But at the same time I´m surprised you didn´t give me a second look.   I am somebody that can really make the difference, I own a house in the vicinity of São Jose dos Campos, Brazil and my resume shows my experience and my strong points. I have a great concept of J&J and I work to work there for several professional and personal reasons. I hope one day I get the chance to talk to somebody,."
"I understand that they should notify the candidate if it is taken into account to continue the process or not, and it would be ideal if not to be taken into account add a brief description of the reasons.
In my case, I did not have any contact despite fulfilling all the requirements expressed in the search."
"I understand that ther is a huge number of candidates, but I think an EMail is the minimum to answer an application"
I understand that the process is the optimum
"I understand that on the site - careers - should have option to input the name or register number from employee when ask ""How did you know about de vacancy?"""
"I understand that J&J is always looking for the best candidates and that, above all, you try to promote internally your associates to fulfill different positions. If I could make a suggestion it would be to consider those of us who are outsiders, but can bring talent, passion and experience. I myself am a business development expert, capable of leading teams to achieve goals. Although I don't come from a medical sales background, I have sold some of the most sophisticated materials and components out there. I believe the recruiter focused too much on my relevant experience and not the potential growth I could bring to the table. 
Thank you for giving me a chance to share these thoughts with you.

"I think, return with yes or no about the recruitment process.
It is good to be remembered."
"I think, as we always hear from the leardership and HR workshops that all the employees has the opportunity to participate of the open positions (even for the positions with Lead candidate), I think I should receive any feeback from the process. In my case, anybody contact me to talk about the position and/or enterview me. It seems that I never apply for it."
"I think your team is great but have a big opportunity to find many talent acquisition if could incorporate a Skype interview and take more time to research people as me who has good experience, good knowledge and with all disposition to make big contribution to Johnson&Johnson.
Thank you so much."
I think you should contact the process participants at the end of the evaluation.
"I think you should contact people - Not just email via- who apply to the job offers, to at least know something about them, and if you continue interested on the candidate, invite them to an interview or any process. "
"I think you should always be preoccupied to give feedbacks even negatives, because the most frustrating part is to be out of the process without knowing why. You should be more flexible to acept candidates without all the experience needed, in my case i know that i can work in a imunology team even without the experience in this kind of market, i just need a chance to be called for a intervew (in all the aplications that i did i was out without doing a intervew) and show how i want to develope myself an learn."
I think you have a good recruitment process
"I think you can:

- make them more personal again (I truely believe many companies are loosing this point as an advantage)
- by posting only jobs that are already needed, portfolio candidates as postes in my opinion doesn't add value un both ways
Thanks"
I think you can create programs to professionals that don't  have the experiency required.
I think you can be more specific with the reasons that you give people who are participating in the selection process
"I think you (JnJ) have great system.
I wish work with you soon.
"
"I think would be important to share the periods the process will take, to know when a call or email will be expected.
"
I think what is missing is some comment about why I were not a good fit for the position I applied to so I can improve.
I think to give more informations on the application because the person create expectations about that and after waiting for a long time have no idea what's happened.
"I think this survey not apply to me because I don´t receive any call for interview, this must to be apply after any interview"
"I think this can be more efficient with first contact via email or phone, personal interview and level tests.

I would like to working with Johnson & Johnson.

I think they should give a real feedback about the recruitment process. They should explain a little more why the participant did not fit for the position. 
I think there should be less email and more personal/telephone contact if the profile was really of interest to the company. The process it is well worked but somehow cold and automated.
"I think The RP is a real chance to join The Company. If is possible, give Feedback to candidate."
"I think the recruitment should be good, although I have not done any recruiting yet, I would like to have an opportunity, because this company is one of the most reputed companies I know, and I can not speak very well."
"I think the recruitment professionals I had contact with were not professional enough. I never received any feedback from the process and when I sent an email asking about the status I received an automated message saying I was no longer in the process. I believe this is not the way a recruiter should behave and I was expecting a more personalised approach and at least some feedback, especially because Johnson & Jonhson declares to be a company where people are the most important. I don't see the point of a recruiter saying you can contact them if you have any questions or concerns and then you never get a reply."
I think the recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson is very good. 
I think the recruitment process is well structured
I think the recruitment process is well structured
I think the recriutment process is very good!
"I think the process of recruiting Johnson & Johnson is fantastic, I received a return even though I was negative of all the vacancies that I applied and this shows me the respect that the company has with people, it makes me more motivated to be part of the team Johnson & Johnson I dream so much, my only recommendation is to give me a job opportunity."
"I think the process it's good and so easy.
Minimal actions needed."
I think the process is good enough.
I think the process is good 
"I think the opportunities are great, but they should give more chances to people who are starting now, because they demand a lot for positions, but it's life and let's try again.

thanks"
"I think the feedback should be improved, because I have been trying some positions and I don't know how I'm not choose even for the interview."
"I think the feedback in the recruitment process could be better. I only recieved a feedback after a long time and after that I sent my resumé in the second time. No contact and feedback for weeks.I decided to answer this survey only because I really like this company. In my opinion J&J is a very reputable company in the market, well-known by the quality of their products. I find it very interesting mission of the company aim to be part of human life at least 1 time per day from birth to maturity. And also the concern that the company demonstrates to the environment, through the project Healthy Planet 2010 (reduction of environmental impacts) and Gl Global Health 2012 project targets to improve the health of employees. I have some friends working in the company commenting that like a lot of work in the company.Since I was younger I always wanted to work in this company. Best regards. Luciene"
I think the company should will improve the contact with the applicant's. I didn't receive any contact.
"I think the company have very talented people, so it was a nice expierence."
"I think the calls are important, even more important that formal e-mails.

Regards!!"
i think that you need to speak with the candidate
I think that you could give opportunity for people who don't have experiencia yet.
"I think that you can know first the candidate before send a mail to inform that you're not choice for position.

That's my opinion.

Cheers,

Iván Castillo"
"I think that they should not only selecting people by their quality at dynamic group, because sometimes it does not qualify the professional. I was eliminate from the trainee selection because I didn't have a good performance in the dynamic group, however it was not totally my fault, once that my group dind't listen my opnions, then my group presented a really bad project. I think that would be a good idea, they only eliminate a candidate, only after after interviews.
Thanks for the opportunity, I would be really happy to have another opportunity to try join Johnson & Johnson Team."
"I think that the recruitment process by the Johnson web page is not working, I never receive feed back of my aplication, I' have over 18 years of experiance in supply chain (6 in the medical device industry) and never receive a chance for an interview.

I know that you are very good company, hopefully you can inprove this process."
"I think that the recruitment process at JNJ is clear enough. I am, constantly, viewing the opportunities, once I am sure that in the future I will be contributing with my work at JNJ. 
There are many opportunities and I am sure that the ""right moment"" will be soon.

 "
"I think that the process should be faster and if anyone is discart, the recruiter should have a communication with the candidate. Also the recruiter should give a feedback."
I think that the process must have more transparency. As candidate I cannot see or understand the evolution of the process. There is no information available and the recruiter has never contacted me.
I think that the interviews would be best
"I think that the company has to be more carefull in the way the treat the candidates. I did not receive any comment or feedback. 
"
I think that the candidate needeneeded more information about the process and some rest or contact about the steps.
i think that the answer could be by phone with the feedback to candidate
"I think that should be open to give opportunities to participate in the process to  experienced people, especially former J&J employees with high levels of growth within the company and proved skills and success. "
"I think that meet ""face to face"" could be awesome! So i will say ""please to meet you"" sincerelly. :) I wish to meet the J&J family work and make me a part of your staff. Thank you very much! "
"I think that Johnson could gave chances for ""justa gratuated"" that don't have professional experience yet, but a willingness to learn and enter in to the market."
I think that johnson and johnson company should give more soport and tracing for each apply from each candidate.
I think that Johnson & Johnson should be contact by any means to know why the profile does not meet expectation
"I think that J & J Recruitment Team could make a call by telephone just to have a better oportunity to know a little more about the candidate. The online contact is not so human and it is very cold, not reflecting the real values of this company."
I think that it would be good to receive detailed feedback related to the process.
I think that it would be good to receive detailed feedback related to the process.
I think that is important to give more information. 
I think that is a lack of respect not to inform the reasons why you were not chosen for the position. This kind of feedback helps the candidate to improve its job search process.
"I think that first of all not posting opportunities that will be filled with internal candidates. Finally an email with at least a ""thank you for applying, but we selected another candidate"", because a lot of times we're still trying to reach the recruiter to follow up with the process, and we don't receive neither a response nor a firm answer. 

Thank you for your time. "
"I think that after make a previous analysis of a candidate profile for any opportunity, Johnson could match the person's profile with other future and open opportunities, even if that person have not applied to these other opportunities."
I think that a multinational company should have an standardized process that involved a feedback communication to all the person who apply for a job position just to let them know that company consider their time as important as the time of the people who already worked in Johnson & Johnson
"I think someone from RH would contact the candidate in order to give feedback.

I know some people from JJ and I realy enjpy the company. "
"I think recruiter should follow up more closely the process because I had to wait many days to hear something about the position again, also she was confused about my CV at the first contact call. She only sent me an e-mail weeks after the last conversation about Jhonson´s decision but no call. "
I think my profile was very compatible with the position I had applied for but I didn't have the oppurtunity because I wasn't contacted at all not even by phone. And I didn't have an interview and as I said before my profile was very appropiate for the position.
"I think just taking the time for letting to someone to know the reason behind for not been considered to a specific position . I as a candidate , when I submit the info to any open position , I do it judging with my background and the profile required for the position , if would not consider myself a good fit for the position , I would not apply at all &gt; definitely J&J are the kind of company I would to join and long term win to win relation business ..

THanks"
I think Johnson & Johnson should interview face to face.
I think Johnson & Johnson should interview face to face.
"I think Johnson & Johnson is a very good option to have a work, about recruitment process I think is very ""clean"" and qualified."
"I think J&J has a good recruitment process. Complete information, easy access, and this feedback request show consideration to the candidate."
I think its necessary to provide a kind of feedback in relation to the process.
I think its everything ok
I think it's good the process of recruitment 
"I think it would improve a lot, if the feed back were more objective and faster."
"I think it would be useful for the candidate to know the reason why is not the perfect match for the position. I think the company is a good reference to learn, to improve and to make my own contribution."
I think it would be nice to know why we were not chosen for a profile. This helps us to prepare ourselves day by day.
"I think it would be interesting to seal candidates without experience in the area, because they have to contribute, since it comes without labels from other competitors."
"I think it would be interesting in the first phase of the selection process, participants will be eliminated by a minimum value note.
It is also interesting to share everyone's note.

Thank you."
"I think it would be good give to the people the reason why can't continuous in the process, not just a general information by email without reasons. It can be good for people to improve in the next time or in a future their skills or be better in a interview or in the selection of the staff. RH is an important part of the company and can demostrate how important are the employers to them even if you don't get the position. Not just reply with the same message for everybody we are not  the same people we are people than we want to make a diference."
I think it would be better to have a databse with all professionals interested in your enterprise and apply one or more.time because they are brand lovers and that is the.most important thing in empmoyees
I think it would be better to communicate at what stage of the process the candidate is
I think it would be better if an email could be sent with updated info if the reccruitment process
I think it will be more fast or more clear about key points for every position avaiable. 
I Think it should contact the person by phone or e-mail to say that he is not fit to the job. I applied over 40 positions during this year and only recieved one e-mail. 
I think it is important to give feedback to the candidates. We were left with high expectations and waiting for a response.
"I think it is important for the candidate to have a feedback during the  recruitment process. I've just got a feedback 01 month later.
thanks"
"I think is very important to contact the candidate and provide him a reason why he was not a good fit for the position.

It would be very usefull for the candidate and also for J&J"
I think is really important as Worldwide company to give the feedback about the results of the interview and what was reason of why I didn't select.  
"I think is necessary give some feedback to candidate, if her/him not pass in the recruitment process. "
"I think is important to understand the process and also to provide a good insight for external candidates to be taken into account. It is not easy to take part on pharma-vacancies. 
The reasons we apply is because we would like to belong to a strong and solid company like Johnson & Johnson"
I think is better to feedback the talent in orden to get the best people for the company 
I think is better to do a feedback evaluación to improve the candidate profile
"I think if you could provide feedback information of why are not able or able to vacancy, it would be great."
"I think I should be more specific about why a candidate is rejected, to improve as a candidate"
I think i does enough
"I think I did not meet the requirements for my age and experience.
I wish they would have given me the opportunity since I am an experienced and very profitable person. Maybe specify the age parameter and experience."
I think he's doing well today.
"I think feedback is very important. Another factor is to better advertise through emails, when the person is registered in the database j & j this would help a lot for the candidates."
"i think about it and the process is good, maybe in the next time i have more chances."
"I suggested to feedback each candidate, not considering a standard email, but considering personal communication, here in Brazil the economic scene is not favorable and a cold email as feedback does help a person who is seeking an opportunity to reach a new job. "
I suggest giving feedback on the progress and end of the process.
"I suggest giving a return to all who have applied, as I see as a lack of consideration the non-return, given the demonstration of interest of the candidate to be part of this reputable company!
"
I sugest a Feedback to the candidate. 
"I submitted my application to a role that I was highly qualified for and I would invite anyone to view my resume to check it for him/herself.
In two days I received an email saying that I was not fit for the role without any explanation for that.
I found the process extremely disappointing and I even began to doubt the transparency of the process or whether there is any bias in the recruiter's decision based on cold facts such as gender or age. "
"I still believe J&J is a great company, and I hope my feedback can be helpful to some extent. 

First: After I was invited for the interview, I tried to come back and read the job description for that position, but the page was not found anymore. I understand that the company did not want to receive applications anymore for that respective position. However, if I had a chance to look at the job description before the interview once again, I would focus my conversation more in what was at stake, and share the experiences that I have that were related to the position, instead of just walking through my resume (which contains only a glimpse of my general skills and achievements).

So my suggestion is to leave the job description page open until the hiring process is finished. And at some point disable the submit application / apply button (and put some kind of message: ""This position is no longer accepting applications"") But keep the job description accessible until the hiring process is finished. Or a second option would be to put the job description together with the ""Thanks for applying"" email. Then the candidate at least would have a record to remember what exactly he or she applied for.

At that given moment I was applying for many different places. After I apply for a job, I will only come back to read the job description once I'm invited for the next stage, otherwise I consider it a waste of time. I believe that other candidates may face a similar situation of multiple simultaneous applications.

Second: The recruiter did not contact me to say they chose another candidate. 4 business days later I sent an email to the recruiter asking for an update, and I received no answer. Thankfully, one week after my second interview, my first interviewer sent me an email saying they moved on with another candidate, and he did encouraged me to apply for other positions."
I signed up for varios opportunities but i was never called or receive any feddback.
I signed up for the job offer but I have never been in your recruitment process.
I should receive feedback
"I sent my data to be considered in another position, I know that this vacancy is for a doctor.

Thank You

Johanna González"
"I see that the initial screening process is very far, of course many candidates, but who comes from another industry can have much to add and ends up having no opportunity to show. For example: sales are sales in any industry, perhaps those who come from another have a better macro view, or can bring insights that can collaborate qualitatively, otherwise the leaders of big companies would not navigate different industries, I believe that in this way we do not create robots, Not always doing the same thing. With different people we have oppununities to add value to the brand."
I see that some times is dificult to explain the reason why we were not a good fit for the position applied but advice some points to develop could be a good feedback to get prepared to new opportunities. 
I see no need for  improvements in the recruitment process 
"I regret that you have declined my application because I know I have the experience and the necessary adherence, but I respect your method. I suggest that even candidates with an adherent profile be made personal contacts."
"I regret that you have declined my application because I know I have the experience and the necessary adherence, but I respect your method. I suggest that even candidates with an adherent profile be made personal contacts."
"I regret that you have declined my application because I know I have the experience and the necessary adherence, but I respect your method. I suggest that even candidates with an adherent profile be made personal contacts."
"I registered on the site.

I did'nt receive contact from the recruitment session"
I recommend that Johnson & Johnson give feedback to the candidates which They have been participated in selection processes. 
"I recently applied for the Commercial Excellence Director - Janssen (301116JANSSEN) position. The only reference to my application was an email to conduct a survey. I did not receive any further information about my application. There was no information weather my qualifications, experience, age or any other reason was a factor. At this time I don't even know if I was disqualified or I am still in the process. 

I wanted to do the survey in order to be able to help Johnson & Johnson improve its communication with the candidates. This does not influence my view about the company. "
I received this survey before knowing whether I go or not to the next step of the recruitment process. 
I received the answer email some months ago.
I received one email asking to input further information in a spreadsheet format after the application process and then an automated email saying I was unsuccessful without any further information. The process should be more personal. 
I received many same surveys.
I received an email to comment about the hiring process. I DID NOT RECEIVE any message related to the process - if my profile fit to requirement or not. I think this is one important thing to improve.
"I received an email telling that this job position was temporarily closed. So, I don't know why I received this survey. 
"
"I received a call with a lot of questions.  Something that got my attention, I consider the recruiter did not fully understood the requirements.  She was looking for someone with Green belt (6 Sigma) certification and I told her I was master black belt and it seems she understood I was underscored when actually it was the opposite.  She asked me about experience of working with community projects, I told her I was coach of community projects, acitve member of community committee at Cummins for several years (over tan 10 years), founder and leader for Women Affinity Group at Cummins too but she told me the company needed to know only if I had experience on community focused activities??  Honestly, maybe the recruiters are not well explained about what to look for and I still waiting to herar about feedback of my results, but I have given up due it has not occurred during several weeks.

Thanks in advance for your attention,
Dora De La Rosa"
"I received 3 to 4 calls to schedule the enterviews. After that, just received an automatic email. I guess the the final decision should be by phone."
"I receive this survey but I have an interview scheduled for tomorrow (February 7th 2017) at 3 PM.
I shouldn't receive this survey if an interview is scheduled or I should be notified that I am not participating anymore. "
"I receive an email informing that I was not choosen for the position, but unfortunatly it is not clear for me the reason why. Since I tried some positions I have some hints but I am not considering apply any more because I am considering I don't have the experience and qualifications to work for J&J"
I really would like the opportunity of having an interview. Besides my resume has a academic part and professional background not industrial. I believe the motivation turns inexperience into learning and there is not what we can not learn. Thanks
"I really think that Johnson & Johnson recruitment process is far away better than the others companies, the process take exactly the time which the recruiter informed, for this reason i can not tell you i specific detail which i would change."
"I really have not been interviewed, I do not understand why they did this survey because they have not called me to talk to anything related to the job.
I really hope you can solve this problem beacause I really would like to be interviewed by your work team."
"I really didn't understand the process because I believe my resume is full of interesting facts, and I was never called not even for an Interview. I know there might me so many interesting candidates but I am not sure about how fair is this process. "
"I possess wide experience and knowledge in administration, accounting and law; therefore, I consider that, Johnson & Johnson could give me at least, the opportunity for an interview."
"I pass all The recuitment process however i didnt take The job because i has another job proposition. 
I considered that i had an opportunity to learn more info The other company.
I consider that all young people are looking for that opportunity si try to explain better The activities The position demands. 
"
"I only sent my resumé and then any other communication, you might send some other information on the status of the application and at what moment you are out of it"
"I only received this email with the survey so I didnt received any information if I will receive the new contact to the company to avanced to the future interview
rgds
I hope the Jhonson&Jhonson contact me because I hope and I want to work there"
"I only received an e-mail informing that I don't fulfill with the position skills requirement. But any feedback about what were my weakness or where should I improve.
I think that it might be good for the candidates that are not selected a feedback on what was the main lack of skills or experience to not get the position.

thanks"
"I note that Johnson & Johnson can do a better recruitment process by giving more opportunities to the administrative service providers (ADM, FISCAL, CONTÁBIL) who already work within the company.
Currently working as outsourced service provider in the Tax department, responding as GFS by the company Manpower Staffing Ltda. This is inside the Johnson & Johnson of Sao Jose dos Campos.
I have a university degree and all the necessary qualifications to become a direct official, being engaged in daily routines, with SAP system and everything that relates to the Creed and security procedures. I believe this is the most important point that Johnson and Johnson's recruiting and talent selection team should look into.
Internal opportunities for outsourced ADM service providers who have the same routines as direct employees, the same qualifications but we do not have the same benefits.

Thank you very much
Leandro Souza.

Never explain me addition from the posted requirements what other responsibilities needs.... "
I never received any contact.
"I never received any contact from any recruiter.
Just one automatic email! "
"I never received a Recruiter's feed back, just a mail sent to me explaining that I hadn't been choosed to the recruitment process."
I never receive return about my canditature. I reckon this is very important for candidate.
I never receive a call or an email to said the process or why I have not been selected. 
I never knew about the position and nobody contact me...
"I never heard back from the recruiting crew, except for the emails saying i was not selected. 
I wonder if they really read my resume. 
But i keep aplying to new jobs at J&J, as I think it is a great place to work and soon there will be a spot for me there."
"I never had a personal contact from JnJ on this opportunity, just an automated workflow
I have always worked at world class organizations (P&G and McKinsey) and I didn't expect this type of response from JnJ"
I never had a contact by any recruiter despite I have all the qualifications listed in the job posting. J&J is an excellent company and should improve on this kind of follow up with candidates.
I never got any feedback after the application 
I never got any feedback about the position.
I never did a selective process at Johnson
I never did a selective process at Johnson
I never did a selective process at Johnson
I never be contacted by a recruter 
I need this job!!!
I need job.
I need feed back
I need a job in Johnson & Johnson 
I like to understand why my profile didn't fit with the position. 
I like the form of recruitment of the company J&J.
"I like that The time for update the result of the process was be in a short time, my last interview was in March 8 and after I never received an update "
I like a feedeback aboutte the recruitment process at J&J 
"I know the J&J has many...many candidates by opportunity but I think the feedback would be much more ""personal""."
"I know that there are a lot of people looking for job, but sometimes we try to send a resume to a position that we don't have experience enough to do a good job on first day. But I believe that we can make the difference, we can go to far as important people in this world. I am gonna try and never give up to one day, work at Johnson!

Thank you very much."
"I know that J&J receives thousands of applications; however, I felt frustated of  not hearing from any Human Resource Department representative of J&J during my application.

It would be nice to inform the candidate regarding each step of the process (Application is received, reviewed, under consideration, rejected, etc).

Unfortunately the process of J&J reflected a ""lack of repect"" to applicants. I mean, you want the best applications, but the applicants do not encounter the best HR representative...

I am from Mexico, and I applied to ""Cls Latam Business Development Manager (1700145268W)"". Feel free to contact me.(my application migth be hidden in J&J´s database).

Best regards"
"I know that a such company like J&J falls down thousands of CV´s, however I´m thinking that they could think a way to at least provide a feedback honestly or either a answer for the application fairly. 

Anyway, appreciate this quiz."
I know recruters have a lot of work but it would make a big difference if they had more closeness to the applicants. Giving feedback about the process. Remember for us seek for a job is a job too. 
I know it si quite hard to provide feedback to every person who apply but that would be great to have a quick word. Best.
"I know it is a robot answers, also knows there are so many applicants, but a robot answer should be more personal as possible to be more friendly. Also this survey should be send just twice, there is a mail weekly. I think if the person didn't answer twice is because doesn't want to be part of the survey. I am working with statistics and most of the companies doesn't deal well with this tool, lack of knowledge and experience to conduct surveys."
"I know is hard but will be noce to receive personal treatment, not just mail.

Best Reards, 

RC"
"I know from a friend, that J&J sometimes do a first phone call contact in english, in order to test the level of this language.  Maybe I've received a call some days after do my application, but unfortunately I don't have good reception in my mobile phone in my work place... I remember to had said that I could not hear well...
Most of recruiters know that if they have to contact a candidate during labor time, asks them if the person can talk in this moment and arrange to do a second call if is not possible to have a private conversation.  Maybe, J&J could do the english test in the second call.
By other hand, I contacted to J&J HR employee, that was publishing a similar position in Linked/in giving their email, so I asked about to this position and others in the future.  But I didn't receive any answer.
I think if the employee included their email in the announce, is in order to receive postulations from other channel and also to give information or answer questions.
If J&J is a company that is compromised to adquiere and retain new talents, must be more careful with the communications manner with the candidates and ever provide a better feedback when decide no select to somebody.  
The personal communications are not common in the new digital world, but some times are needed to remember that we are humans. "
"I just want to clarified that I never was contacted by any recuiter from Johnson & Johnson for the position I applied for.
So I can´t give my feedback about the recruitment. "
"I just needed a live, human feedback. Your first question here, for example, was quite a surprise for me: recruiters *never* tell us why did we not fit a job..."
"I just got an email saying my resume wasnt suitable so thank you for nothing, and got it so quick that it seemed more like an automatic reply.

But whatever,

Best."
I just fill in the information on the page but I did not get a response or someone contacted me for any interview or information about the vacancy
I just apply to a position but i never got the feed back actually i didn't know whats going on with the process

"
"I have received three emails asking to feedback on the recruitment process. Which is very strange as I never received an update on the actual recruitment process.....

People spend time researching the company, filling out the online forms, writing cv's and cover letters. It's very poor to see that J&J then doesn't even send a (standard) letter to let a person know they didn't progress."
"I have received an email to answer this survey more tan five times in the las 20 days.

The problem is that, although I did apply for a position in J&J, I have never been reached neither interviewed, or contacted for it.

Botton line is, you are sending surveys to the wrong people, at least you should check that the person has been considered for the position and at least contacted via email or pone.

I did take the survey in order to reach the comment box and be able to inform you of this, so you can improve your process.

Therefore, I can not provide you a properly information.

Tks anyway

"I have not receive a call or an email from people from Johnson and Johnson at all I don\t know if I am acceptable to continue with the process or not. But I like this company a lot and hope to work for you

"I have not had any kind of contact from a recruiter of J&J regarding this position.

It seems that this questionarie should be post-interview, right? I answered the questions hoping to have this chance to explain my case.

I think the position was filled since there is a question of been aware of the reasons I was not selected. A bit disspointed for this process but I think mistakes could happen anywhere.

Best,
Rodolfo"
"I have not got any interview call from there yet. So, how can I assist you ?"
I have not been invited to an interview 
"I have not accomplished all recruitment steps, and so, I do not thing I can help very much. "
"I have no complaints. In my opinion, the selection and recruitment process was effective"
"I have never received feedback from Johnson & Johnson recruiters.
I never had the information that had participated in any selection process in all the opportunities applications.
"
"I have never received a phone call to participate in the recruitment process.

None call me.  I was pretty interesting in the position.

I have never been involved in a recruitment process. I applied for a job some weeks ago but never heard from someone from Johnson & Johnson.
"I have never been interviewed for any position.
I answered the survey to remain in your database.
Thank you!"
"I have idea about the importance to belong to Johnson's team, on the other hand I my oinion; external candidates has hard difficult in getting a role to the company  by few opportunities. Lately i have enrolled to sevaral positions accordance my skills andknowleges but I never was called even with a such good experience as professional in my specific area.

I have had no reply from J&J of my application
I Have experiene in HR and I need just one opportunity.
I have been applying for some positions at J&J and have never been contacted or even noticed about the process status.  Workflow is weak and no feedback observed. Still a lot to do in the matter of recruitment status flow... 
"I have been a candidate for several years for various job vacancies at the esteemed company's website; I always update my resume looking for opportunities; But I've never been called in for interviews or even had a feed back on my applications.
I have a great desire to work for Johnson, but I never got a chance"
"I have apply for at least 5 positions inside J&J in the last 3 months however I have not been contacted with someone or even received an email regarding recruitment process and status.   At least explain what the reasons I have not been selected. 

In others hands I received 5 surveys to improve J&J recruitment process is this make sense?  

I hope this can help in near future , J&J understand there is a bright talent hidden behind forms and resume waiting a opportunity to shine."
"I have appllied my resume for several positions, received a lot of emails that I was in the process however nobody get in contact, never and no reply if the job is open or if was fullfilled.

"I have applied to many positions and was never contacted for interviews or anything. I would suggest the Johnson's company to consider my Curriculum and, at least, call me so I can introduce myself and say why I am applying to these and what I am looking for. I am pretty sure I can highly contribute for the growing of IT Services at Johnson & Johnson company."
"I have applied to 5 positions in Supply Chain and/or for the last 6 months.
I fulfilled the minimum requirements such as education, experience (including healthcare industry), languages...
I have never been contacted by anyone even for an initial assessment by phone, at least.

"I have applied several times for jobs that matched really well with my experience and I have never been selected to participate in any process .
It has been difficult for me , to have any chance of approach to someone from México´s HR team  just to have some kind of  value feedback for future  applications.
"
"I have applied many times for many position to work at Johnson & Johnson.
I never could be part of any recluting process

Sometimes I applied for the position I would like to take, but I did not have the experience in each tasks detailled. However, I had experience in the posicion, a full professional career according to the position, and I believe that I can always learn, improve and innovate in my work. And it could be the challenge for me.

Other times, I asked for positions I was sure I had everything to do an excellent job, but, I never had a call, a video call or an interview.

I know there are many applicants but it is really discouraging dont have the possibility to meet each other at least.

It is estrange to recibe this survey asking me if the recuiter provide me a reason why i was not a good fit for the position i applied to, because i have never been in touch which anyone from Johnson Argentina.

Regards,"
I have applied many times but I have not been contacted. I worked for J&J by 2 years from 2005-2007 at Cordis de Mexico. I was developed by J&J since New Product-Process Development to Production Validations-Release Product-Process. I would like to have the opportunity to have Interviews again and be able to work at J&J again I recognize J&J like very strong company and I was proud when I was working there.

"I have applied for a couple of position, however, I have never been contacted neither I have never received feedback even though I fit with the profile. 

You should to tell me what are my real possibilities."
"I have answered the previous quiz and in general this process is very good, but always can improve somewhere. Thank you!!"
"I have a very personal point of view once in past I had to refuse a J&J offer due to family reasons. However, the whole selection process was a kind of example about how to handle candidates during all phases. For this reason and now living other personal moment that I keep trying new opportunities at J&J. For this opportunity in specific case it does not matter whether the recruiter contact me or not, once I know that the experience I had can tell me that this is not the behaviour within J&J. "
I hadn't a interview
"I had the opportunity to participate in other recruitment process for Sales Planning Coordinator - Vision care. In this process, I was interviewed by Human Resource and the manager responsible for this position.
So, I did not receive any answer about this other process.
 "
I had not been contacted for an interview yet. Theres is no aditional information I can provide about it.
I had just received one e-mail from the recruiter thanking me for my application and forwards another one telling that other candidate was selected.I would like to receive a more complete feedback from the recruiter.
"I had contacted the talent acquisition team myself in order to have some feedback. As far as I understood the process is still ongoing and I have not received any communication regarding my participation . 
"
I guess is more easy to contact people by phone 
I guess at least a phone cal to explain why I as not chosen for the job and also a feedback about which skils should I improve to become I JNJ employee 
"I got the survey but I was never invited to any recruiting process, I would have liked to participate in the recruitment process, since I feel that J&J is a company where I can develop my skills and acquire a lot of professional experience."
I got a call from private number and voice quality was very poor.  I have told so many times to the interviewer that I am not able to hear you properly and I am just assuming the question and answering to you.  I have never experience such a poor recruitment process in my 14 years of professional career. 
I found out I was not a good fit for the position through this survey. 
I found it important that Johnson & Johnson always informed about the status of the selection process. In my opinion you do not need to improve anything.
"I felt that I was rejected to that process just because of my salary pretension. Maybe I'm wrong buy take that determination after I've propose a first tentative of salary band and with a couple of email exchange, that is at least a hint. And in the end the intervier said that!
I work for an international company, I know market salaries for this kind of companies and for sure what I requested for this position wasn't 35% far for the SG band.
Net net it is possible that my experience couldn't fit for the position but it's important to be polite/educated/smart and find a better excuse to reject somebody with strongest argument than salary; mainly when you don´t know me at all.
I don't want to get somebody in troubles, really I did want to fill the survey but I've received severals emails encouraging me to do it.
Have a nice eve J&J Team!!"
"I felt good with this process, especially I liked the letter explaining the non-choice."
"I feel discriminated by your team in Mexico.
I have applied several time to position were I'm totally sure that I fit with them and never I have been considered for an single interview. 
I wonder why is that? "
"I expected at least to interviewed as I totally fit the join description, have the experience, know the people who works there. I wasn't considered at all in the process. "
"I don´t know why I received this email when no one in J&J called me for an interview
You need to send these emails to the people that participated in a interview"
"I don´t have been  called, my responses aren´t usables for your survey.

"I don´t have any idea, because I have a good feeling about the recruitment process. Johnsons & Johnson is the only company what offer to all canditate a feedback about the recruitmente process. I like it, because a think it a good corporate value.
Soon I will be competent enough to work in the Johnson & Johnson!
Thanks for all!

"I don't`know why I receive this survey, if I didn´t have any feedback and any response by J&J. So many answers don`t apply because I didn`t have any contact with any recruiter."
"I don't understand why I'm receiving this survey. Although I applied for more than one position at J&J I was never contacted by a recruiter, was never interviewed or consider for a position at the company. 
I would love to be part of the J&J family, but apparently I don't have the skills and/or competencies required. 
Best regards and success to you all."

I don't know but all the recruiment process are different so I can't to give you a reason.
I don't know
"I don't have a suggestion, just to point the good aspect. 
I would like to talk about how good was the process with feedback and respect to the candidate. "
I do not understand why you insist to do this survey when you have never invited me to have any interview. 
"I do not received a formal feedback, so i don't know, why i as refused in this position.

Thanks"
"I do not know how are  the recruitment process, but i would like to inform the applicant, because i was not chosen in the process and the aspirant in this way can improve and may have an opportunity to participate again,  tkanks"

I do not have any comments Thank you
"I do not have an interview, so I can´t answer it."
I do know the recruitment process in J&J and the automation you have in the process. This kind of message is a very good option to talk to the candidate however I was not being contacted by any recruiter from J&J. Thanks for the opportunity to give my feedback.
"I do believe that from the candidate point of view, an update of the process as soon as possible wold be important to maintain the candidate involved and motivated to participate in J&J hiring process."
"I didn´t receive information about the process. I hoped some call or information about the process but .... My name is Ricardo Rojas +57 3212105702 from and just wanted participated in the hiring process. 

I don´t know what happened but I am feeling bored with J&J."
I didn´t receive any feed back and also the responsivle didn´t give details about the process. Very bad experience
I didn´t have the opportunity to be interviewed
"I didn´t have an interview. So this survey is not for me.

"I didn't receive any people contact about this recruitment process. And, I would like to be contacted to describe in details my knowledgements."
I didn't receive any information about the process of the recruitment
"I didn't receive any feedback regarding the jobs at J&M in which I've candidated myself.
It would be nice if the Rh team could send a feedback to the candidate.
Thank you, Mariana"
I didn't have a contact with the recruiter even though i was feeling i have the right skills for the job. I just received a message saying that my profile didn't fit with the position.
I didn't go through any interview process at J&J and wasn't really expecting to fill in this kind of survey as no one contacted me before. It is kind of a shame to find out that the process to find an ideal candidate for this company is not clear and clean.
"I didn't get any feedback about the position I've applied for, not even the ""default message"", ususally sent in cases like this.
Despite J&J seems to be a great company, the process itself doesn't reflect the image I have from the company
Thanks for the opportunity
Manuel"
"I didn't get any contact from this process at all. Even if my Resume do not atende the position at this moment, you should give us a feed back."
I didn't even receive an answer from you. Everything in the recruitment process needs to be improved. I've worked 2 and a half years for Janssen and I didn't even receive a call from talent acquisition. Totally disappointed. 
"I didn't been contact by the recruiter, and in one case they only send me a notification that the process was closed.  "
I did the bad site registration I have not been called yet.
"I did postulate for this job but I did had any communication with a human resource not even an email 
Only the email confirming my postal union and now this email asking for my opinion about the process that I had none
"
i did not recived any call from johnson & johnson
I did not received even an e mail about the status of the vacancy it seams to me that the plataform in the US is not connected with J&J México 
I did not receive contact from any recruiter.
"I did not receive communication about the position, I only have the email with this survey. 

Thanks!"
I did not receive any personal return.
I did not receive any information about the process! No one contact me per e-mail nor per telephon! I would be very happy to been part of the process!
I did not receive any feedback and that would have been great 
I did not receive any contact about the position I had applied.
I did not receive an invite for an interview.
"I did not receive a feedback related with the open vacancy. So, J&J could improve the feedback."
"I did not participate in the selection process, because there was no contact. I would love to be part of this company soon and follow my love for this important company."
I did not hear from recruiter.
I did not get any contact about the process.
"I did appreciate the reply, although generic, which is exactly what i would suggest to improve. A more personal approach with a clear explanation as to why one was not selectores."
"I did 6 recruitment processes during 2016 and 2017, as I filled up above, all process is really good. However, I wasn't hired (according your feedback) because you choised internal candidates.

I completly agree with this internal political, however this is quite frustrating for external candidates because we spent a lot expectations in this process.

I think would be more fair if J&J make an internal recruitment process, firstly, and then open it for external candidates.

I hope that my sugestion be usefull."
I could say why not be qualified!
I could do an interview via skype.
"I consider that Johnson & Johnson should inform the reason why the person is not accepted.
"
"I consider J&J as the best company to work. I have worked at J&J and I really want to be a J&J employee, however, nothing is perfect and unfortunately the norms of Our Credo are not fully applied, there are prejudice with regard to candidates, because according to Our Credo J&J makes no distinction Religion, sex, age, or any other type of discrimination. I have been discriminated in selective processes.

I will continue to insist, as I know I have all the qualifications to be a J&J collaborator."
I consider it good
"I completed my subscription some time ago, but I remember that even using a model (linkedin or file) there are many other information to me completed and the information it got from the linkedin/file cames in a wrong format. It could be easier and faster like some others sites at the internet."
"I case of not completing process, feed applicant back by the reasons"
"I can't say anything aboout de recruitment process. I didn't get contacted by any recruiter for a interview.
But I have friends that work at JnJ and they say that is a great company to work."
"I can't provide any comments since i've never been contacted to continue the recruitment process.
"
"I can understand that recruiting for a position is sensitive in most of the cases. But it´s quite important to understand what aspect of the professional background do not (or did not) fit to a certain unsuccesful submission.

Thank you. "
"I can see a process, is more like a computer follow up, no communication no nothing...."
I can not answer because I've never been in the Johnson & Johnson selection process!
"I belive that to improve would be to call the candidate for interview and meet the person. Simply analyse a paper or currilum online is very superficial. The company may be losing great candidates, sometimes it is giving a chance and believing that I can rather overcome the challenges of opportunity. 
I will take you to read and understend what i have tried to express. Thank you!"
"I believed that Johnson & Johnson would improve the recruitment process; We can observe the real experiences of the candidates with a closer contact, such as an interview phone call aloud to the top of the curriculum. And professionals who know Johnson as former employees and suppliers.
"
"I believe your recruiters are not reading the CVs. I saw several positions that I had the right fitting, but I was never contacted for an interview. "
I believe the feedback provided by the recruiter is too much poor. Maybe a good feedback could include the reasons in topics or bullets addressing how the applicant has performed in the process and the main reasons to not be selected.
I believe the feedback is very important in a recruitment process.
I believe the candidate should be given the chance to speak to a recruiter. What is on paper tells a partial story. Verbal contact many times paints a clearer picture of the candidate.
I believe that the recruiter should give feedback to all candidates.
I believe that the recruiter should contact the candidate to inform that he/she does not apply to the position.
"I believe that the process, due to the number of proposals that are presented, is slow in choosing the applicants.
Now, I think it would be very interesting, to be told in a time close to the definition, if the applicant has possibilities or how he goes in his career.
I understand that it could be the way to motivate even more those who present themselves to the careers for you proposals."
"I believe that the process should be more fair and clear. I was never contacted for an interview, so the recruiters missed the chance to meet a potential candidate.

I consider that, if the position is already taken it should no be published. Or at least all candidates should have the chance of having an interview. By doing so the company can be aware of internal talents and their career expectations.

Finally, I did not receive feedback nor updates. I had to send several emails in order to have information of the process status."
"I believe that the company should include the life experiences of the candidate and the diversity of activities carried out by him, as na indication of how active, creative and flexible he may be to contribute research and development work. Often the candidate has not had a long career in the larg industry, but has been involved with research throughout his life, since high school, which makes him familiar and fully capable of developing research in companies such as Johnson&Johnson. Another interesting factor that the recruitment industry should take into account is the range of ideas and solutions that the candidate brings with them, coming from the interfaces of their experiences. 
"
"I believe that provide the feedback is super positive.
Normally, Medical and Janssen provide the feedback. Consumer normally send a automatic e-mail - I understand that the volume/demand is totally different, however I believe that is really good hear from recruiter the reason that the candidate is not being considered at recruitment anymore"
"I believe that Johnson & Johnson has a great form of recruitment. It was one of the few companies that gave an answer, even being negative. I have great appreciation for Johnson & Johnson."
"I believe that Johnson & Johnson although to have a good way to give the feedback, would be good if started to send the reasons and requirements the candidate wasn't approveted. Besides that, the english skill could be mensured trought proficience test online. And after, if the candidate pass, the test could be personally. "
I believe that JnJ has a good recruitment process.
I believe that is important to improve the feedback step of the process and keep the candidate in touch with opportunities for a better fit profile
I believe that for some IT related problem I did not receive the email informing that I did not go through the recruitment process.
I believe that curricular analysis is a very superficial process. Entrevitas to better understand how a professional can contribute to the Company. Also eliminate some prejudices about the professional based simply on the professional background. The company can lose great talent because of the lack of sensitivity of some recruiters.
"I believe that competencies are often requested, such as knowing the Immunology market, being competences highly developed in competent professionals. 
That is, if you are an excellent professional, not having knowledge of a market and very little to not be called for an interview."
"I believe that by continuing to deliver this feedback, it helps and a lot of people improve their development. Thank you
"
I believe that being more transparent and opening up more opportunities for professionals of other degrees such as Business Administration to compete in positions related to areas of quality and processes.
"I believe that an increase in opportunities for people who have a great interest in being part of this company, the fact that I indicate the company to other people try to be part of this company, is simply because I already follow in a certain way how the company behaves in Relation to employees."
"I believe Johnson does not need to improve the recruiting process because I know they are competent professionals who are selecting candidates, my dream is to work at Johnson and just wanted to know what I can do to be a part of this group."
I believe Johnson & Johnson would improve the recruiting process by giving feedback on the points that were not favorable to hiring the candidate.
I believe Johnson & Johnson recruitment is very crafted and carried out by highly trained professionals. I had the opportunity to participate more than once in J&J processes and have always been very well guided and with complete information about the opportunity and about the company. I believe they have created more desire in my person to be part of J&J. 
I believe J&J could improve its Communication process by using social media.
"I believe J&J can improve on one point:
That there is a personal contact after the application, since the candidate has the necessary qualifications."
I believe it is respectful to provide a feedback to the candodates regarding the process they have gone through.
"I believe it is important to mention which of the requirements have not been fulfilled for the application to be rejected, so that the candidate can look for development for future opportunities."
"I believe in the potential of the company in the selection of candidates. And I look forward to new opportunities for applications.
"
"I believe in Johnson & Johnson, and for me is a honor to work in this entreprise."
I believe if the recruiter contact directly the candidate the recruitment process would be more efficient and clear. I just received a mail in the end of the process.
"I believe I had the skills and experiences for the job, but didn't not receive a call or decent reason why I was a fit for the position."
"I believe I had all the skills asked for the position, but no one contacted me even to ask me some questions. 
Disappointed with the recruitment process."
"I believe I can contribute to this process, even by having already been a recruiter as well as manager responsible for talent acquisition in my (not so far) past.

I was contacted for a position outside Brazil (Colombia) last year and, coincidentally, the next day, for a less senior position in Brazil, but both recruiters did not know about both cases and after that first contact, I believe they have talked to each other and I did not receive contact for about 3 months since then. After 6 attempts of my return through different channels, they finally contacted me again in Brazil for a proactive mapping that also did not evolve. I recently applied for an open position here at your unit in the city where I live but the recruiter informed me that there were no vacancies open, though it remains open on LinkedIn.

Trying to summarize learning and corrective actions for all of this (I explained above to give you context only), I believe that 2 points are fundamental: communication at least every fortnight and live (even at a distance) from the entire Recruitment and Selection team and some channel with on-time status of all processes with procedure and training so that everyone understands and fulfills a flow for contacts with candidates choosing better channel and periodicity for both. For critical cases with communication problems, I recommend phone calls for placement of candidates on the process as a whole. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute because I believe in the mission as HR to value people, both inside and outside an organization."
I asked 2 times via email for feedback from the HR people I had contact with during the process and never heard back from them. After learning more about the company my interest to colablorate with J&J grew siginicantly. I really would like to know what can I do better if I'm lucky enough to have the opportunity to be considered in a future process.
"I appreciate you being contacted to respond to this survey. I think that the first contact between the applicant and the human resources area is very important. Who postulates to a new position, has the expectation of knowing a new company and its culture. My personal experience with J & J's talent area was not positive. I never received a response or feedback from the talent area. I hope this comment helps to improve the processes of contact and recruitment.
Regards
Walter Fletcher"
I appreciate you being considered for this position
"I appreciate to have received an automated email informing I was not suitable for the position, despite it was not a direct email from HR team "
"I appreciate the reason that i don't have the possibility of a interview.
With this information is more easy decide send or don't send again the resume.
Thanks for give me the opportunity to give you 1 advice.

Have a good Week!"
"I appreciate the fact that you are concerned about receiving feedback about your recruitment process, yet I wasn't formally in your process, I just sent an email that got an automatic reply and 6 months later a thankyou note. I assume we weren't a match to begin with as an interview was never conceived.
From the little interaction I had with Johnson & Johnson I can say the following, receiving a thankyou note gives you a thumbs up, answering after 6 months not so much, that's a long time for a recruitment process. Compared to your peers which take 1 to 3 months, a lot can change in 6 months, but its better than not hearing anything from you at all. 
Best Regards."
"I appreciate the fact of letting a candidate know that he wasn´t selected for a role, however, it may be good to understand the reason behind not being a good fit for the position. "
"I appreciate that you invite me to fill out the survey, however I have not had a selection process with J & J, I just sent a resume and I have not been informed about whether the selection process has been started in addition to the application.

I applied for this position a couple of months ago and unfortunatelly I have never received any feedback or contact from the J&J talent acquisition's area. Therefore my answers were based on the lack of returning from the responsible area. 
"I applied for the IRDP2017 - Latin America Argentina. When I had the phone interview, the interviewer informed me that there was no position available in that program for Argentina. The recruiter was very polite and apologize for the misunderstanding."
"I applied for several jobs, but I got no real reply."
"I applied for more than ten searches and a large percentage of them corresponded to my profile, they never called me nor gave me feed back because they did not advance in the position. "
"I applied for EHS Engineer on December 18th., 2016. Since then, through this survey is my first feedback to my application.

I think unusual asking for feedback when no feedback was provided.

I hope this input will make Johnson & Johnson more appealing for future employees and customers.

"I am Peruvian and during my interview with J&J, the recruiter told me that there were no positions in Peru available and I was not sure I can work in other countries without sponsorship. She told me she was going to send me an email to have her contact so we can be in touch, but I didn't receive it. Right after my interview, I found that as a Peruvian, I can also work in Colombia, Bolivia, and Ecuador. I sent her two notes explaining my finding, but I didn't hear back from her (I got her email from another employee at the firm).

I believe it would be better to show the recruiter's email address if the candidate already has an interview. The communication would be better."
"I am not sure what are the criteria and filters for this survey, but I was never even called in for a interview. I only interacted with the selection process through the system and automated messages. Nevertheless, I chose to answer this survey to give this feedback and reiterated my interest in similar positions at J&J.
Given my participation, there is not much I can contribute in terms of improvement points."
"I am doing the survey, because Iam bored to received the mail to many times. J&J it is a very nice company for my that the recruitment process does not matter.

"I am a senior professional with large experience in areas that I am applying for.
It is possible that many other candidates could better fit to specific needs of each position, but what  is not clear is why I haven't be contacted by any recruiter at any time, even for a short phone conversation.

I had the opportunity to meet some Executives and Directors whose opportunities I had applied previously. They frankly told me that I could fit to their needs, and they couldn't realise the reason the HR people haven't invited me to take part of the processses.
Neither I...."
"I am a little disappintted, because I just received an email from recruitment thanking for the interest for the Job, but I was not the person that they looked for, but they didn't informed why not if I have al knolegde that they wanted, it happens several times. Daisy"
I am a current employee and I haven't received feedback from HR yet. 
"I agree that among J & J companies there is a lot of young talent that has been stuck by the same staff, people with the skills, tools and studies necessary to fulfill the objectives of the position. And do not give them the opportunity.

They look for an antiquity that in the company and when they comply with an antiquity does not meet the requirements, although what has been learned, it is not always possible to translate a paper with which it details to CV

In other words, add the company to your company with extensive experience when there are within the company that have the potential and everything that knows the product and the complexity of manufacturing their products

Personally I get many ideas to improve even though I do not share it because I do not feel the opportunity and I do not consider it selfish I consider that I would not be paid a fair price for what I know and what benefit in development."
I  think that they should bet for new talent and immigrants
"Humanizar o processo, tudo é automático (vantagem), mas é frio (desvantagem)."

HR should give feedback about the interview and maintain the date of appointment.
HR at Johnson & Johnson Mexico must be more aware of the people who are applying at the site. I think you never take a look at those people who are constantly feeding your candidates database at J&J site. 
How likely are you to recommend Johnson & Johnson as a prospective employer to family and friends
"Houve uma falha de comunicação no meu processo seletivo, estava de férias nesse periodo em viagem internacional, passei para o recrutador o meu contato pessoal uma vez que meu contato comercial estava fora de serviço. O recrutador não seguiu minhas orientações ligando para o contato comercial e não conseguiu falar comigo. Finalmente quando conseguimos nos comunicar, o processo ja tinha sido concluido. "
"Honestly the process was good. Maybe it took a little bit longer than what I was expecting. But this is fully normal for positions and roles like the one I was participating. I really look forward to be part of the process again, and hopefully  become part of the J&J team in the near future.

"Honest people, and not influense by the internal relations."
Hold a phone interview with me. The resume does not always give the best reflection of a person's potential. Especially true for sales which is more about attitude than experience or how well you type your resume. 
"Hola,

Considero que la mejora puede darse en los temas de comunicación, quizás el tiempo es un factor importante, demoró más de 5 meses este proceso, quizás por factores internos, aunque no se nos proporcionó mayor feedback al respecto.

Del resto, considero Johnson & Johnson siempre como una gran y excelente alternativa para laborar. Esperando colaborar juntos en un futuro, muchas gracias por la encuesta.

"Hi, thanks for the participation. I want to tell you an experience that has to do with how the multinationals decide. In Argentina, I represent a pharmaceutical laboratory in San Luis (Ion Laboratory, ex Interbelle Cosmetics, group ELEA) that manufactured many years Listerine. We can make Listerine again with the same quality of so many years already proven and at less cost than bringing it from Brazil, which would increase its sales and / or profitability for J & J. Every time with a multinational they want to propose an idea, it buries it with bureaucracy and it is not advanced. After many years in the industry (I graduated as an engineer in Roemmers, I met the business of ELEA and also managed the business third) I discovered that behind the regulations and the consequent bureaucracy there were comfortable employees, who did not take risks for the company. Is a drawback that I see in human resources systems, which form companies with very rigid people who model the business so as not to contradict the parent company. I will test you. Now they know that the company that made many years listerine wants to analyze with you to be able to manufacture it again in that plant of San Luis (now independent of the group ELEA). Do you think you could get someone from J & J to contact us? Try it, it's a good business option. Best Regards, Rafael"

Good Morning
Attached copy of mail how I support my participation in the selection process in 2016 for the South zone. Passing all the stages of the same and arriving at the final interview in which I called a lot of attention that the interviewers did not have my CV, therefore and given my experience that interview was only PROTOCOL. The person was already selected, I have 8 years of work and I found it unworthy and disrespectful. You went to me to consult and I answered you with the truth. THAT SHOULD NEVER BE LESS THAN A LARGE COMPANY HOW J & J. Until today I think it was this Head of Line.

"Hi,

Specifically, for  this position ,  I never received a reply for my job´s application. Thus I can´t to contribute with further improvements for this recruitment process.

"Hi! I'm a little confused. Yes, I apply to an online process but they never called me"
"Hi! I applyed through your website to other positions, I was called for this one I wasn´t interested. Then the HR manager contacted me again for another one, I passed through the process, but waiting for the ""last interview""with your company, I recieved another 2 proposals, so I declined the last interview of J&J. 
There were 2 weeks I didn´t recevied any notice; when I was hired with another Healthcare company, the HR manager called me to schedule the last one. 
The position I accepted represented a bigger challenge, so maybe the result was going to be the same, but at least to stay in contact with the candidate helps to maintain the expectations and real possibilities alligned.Thank you!"
"Hi guys

This is the second time I take the time to answer your survey for the same position that I applied months ago.

This makes me think that your recruitment platform is a black hole where mi CV got lost in time and space.

Hope this survey doesn´t end there and it helps you fix this perception that me and other possible talented people have.

Good luck"

"Hello good night, thank you for considering me. To improve the recruitment process, I consider that they could consider telephone calls, question the personality of the participants, considering both professional and personal aspects.

"Hello everyone!

I really want to work at Johnson & Johnson and when I got your call, I felt incredible!

During my process, I passed for five different fases, such as dynamic, group interview, another job interview with the manager and individual test in rational skill and microsoft excel.

It was amazing!

Unfortunately the position was closed, twice.


But, only two situations maked me sad:

First: I'm working right now. I was getting out around two hour per day, of my current job to participate of this process and I was really enjoying this process. 
I used my time and some money to offer my best because I really wanted to get this position.

I really applyed my time, money and resources to get it.

Then a month later, nothing. Two, three months later and no one called me or sent me any email explaining what happened.
I made my effort to get this position and the only thing that J & J could do to please me about my application and desire, and my respect for this process is send me an answer, no matter what choice they maked.

Second: When we are in a job interview process, we put a great deal of expectation on everything and the feedback is very important to us.
It may be a small feedback, no problems, but, we need to know what can be improved on our profile to get this opportunity or another position in the future.
If we never know what happens, what needs to be improved, how can we be better for the next opportunity?
I would like feedback on my mistakes and my weaknesses, areas for improvement.
On this path, I can improve and go stronger for my next opportunity and job interview.

Two simple things will greatly improve for us and will put much value in our time and dedication to accept the invitation from J&J to participate of that process of acquisition talent.

Thank you for this opportunity to send you my feedback!

Greetings!

"He told me that he will be in contact next week after the interview, so as I didn't have any answer I tried to obtain a feedback.  Finally three weeks later he contact me and explained that J&J decided to postpone the process until January and additional to that, they founded another profile with a better fit.  
The second week of January I received an email, in which the system said that the position was closed so nobody was hired.

I think it would be very good to give us the opportunity to learn how to use the systems they handle in the maquiladora industry.

I also believe that this idea of making these kinds of encounters and even being able to say what we think about you is truly great, I thank you for your time and I will continue trying to be part of this great company.

"First: Again, I was not called for any interview. In the last process I have applied the young lady in charge of interviewing me was eating snacks while I was talking. That is not really a professional way to do it. Second i was informed about a label I got from her which I disagree totally. J&J shall take this process more seriously."

Second, I didnt have the chance for an interview"
"First, it is not the first time I apply for a J&J position. I do want to work for this company...and I will.
For this specific position I was not even contacted by a recruiter - not even by e-mail.
But I can tell you that these young HR's recruiter are very shallow professionally wise where interviewing one person. Recently I was interviewed by one of these young ladies that was eating salties (like cheetos) while talking to me. It is very frustrating facing this situation when one needs a job."
"First, I would like to thank Johnson & Johnson for the research, but unfortunately I did not receive any feedback from the recruiter or email advising that the vacancy had already closed.

Without doubt we are in the labor market, we need to understand why we do not follow in the process so that we can improve and evolve to the next ones, so this would be my point of improvement for the company about its current selection process.

If you need more information, I will be at your disposal, it will be a great honor to meet you again,

"First, I don't have idea how is the process of recruitment. It's good if you explain that.
Second, the recruiter should contact all the candidates and explain the reason why They are not fit the position.
And if you are in Peru, it's good idea to do all the process in Spanish.
I think  i m good for the position, and I have the question mark of the reason. It's good you do this survey. I hope my answers could help you to improve the recruitment process."
"First, hire me!  I really admire the company and would like to be part of this great corporation. 
I participated in another process at J&J, and the process itself was very much well conducted, we had some small  issues of canceling the interview, but it was explained.  
Thank you and I will keep looking the opportunities. 
JC"
first you should encourage all type of candidates and then please take a survey
"First of all, if you are asking for a process, be aware if the process was in place otherwise you would be perceived as if you don't know what's happening in the company.
No recruiter has contacted me for this position; in the past, for example last year and years before I have had some interactions and interviews with some colleagues as part of a great experience, I've met Lisandro Cataño, Carolina Castillo and Valeria Vasquez from Argentina and some other countries in LA.
I know that J&J is a great place to work, I'm fully in agreement with your credo and for the most important part, you are generating new opportunities constantly so, I will be applying for new job posting in the future.

Do not hesitate to contact me for further information

Outra oportunidade que após o desgaste do processo seletivo a vaga foi cancelada e não foram dadas explicações adequadas. Faltou alinhamento de expectativas.

"Do the internal recruitment before opening external recruitment. The internal people have advantages and we dont't waste time, money, hope for a recruitment tha tá internal person has more condition to be suitable."
Do really what they say they do. Engage with the professionals who are looking for the possibility to work and develop our skills and talent for the growth of the company having communication which is the most important thing in the system.
Do personal interviews
do not take such long time to answer
"Do not send those automatic responses because the talents are not just a role, I believe that HR's are missing out on many opportunities to hire people who make a difference.
People are not just a role, and I believe that RH in Brazil is always following a fashion (Trends), and they pass people who are not in the ""fashion"" and end up losing great talents"

Do not put intern to make the interview.
Do not ask to complete surveys if you have not provided an actual response on the selection process result.

Dizer o porquê de nao ter sid selecionado.
"Disculpen me estan invitando a participar en una encuesta y yo ni siquiera he sido contactada por nadie de ustedes. Por lo tanto no entiendo como me envian llenar algo si no he participado, por eso en todo estoy en totalmente desacuerdo"
Discernimento na escolha do candidato pelas suas experiências e não discriminação pela idade e lingua
"Diría que hasta resulta irrespetuoso envíen una encuesta evaluatoria cuando siquiera tuvieron la deferencia de enviar un correo (no de Bot) diciendo tu perfil no se ajusta a nuestra búsqueda porque sos ""viejo"". En la era de la despersonalización y la automatización, me he tomado el tiempo en responder su encuesta para satisfacer sus estadísticas consciente de la inutilidad de la misma pero satisfecho de no claudicar a mis principios. Los postulaciones de adultos de cierto rango etario resultan invisibles para los reclutadores, ya sean directos o tercerizados, eso no hace más que dar cuenta de la degradación y discriminación que les caracteriza."
Direct interview
Direct contact with the future talent and give the candidate the opportunity to explain their skills and knowledge.
"Direct contact with the applicant

Direct contact
Deveria entrar em contato com cada candidato e dar uma informação mesmo que seja negativo pois nos como candidato ficamos ansioso pois almejamos trabalhar em uma empresa como a Johnson & Johnson obrogado  
"Deve ser realizada a entrevista pessoalmente para cargos como a posição na qual me candidatei.

Não vi preparo adequado ( forma de entrevistar) na condução da pessoa que me entrevistou. Essa pessoa me relatou que seria uma prévia , e que realizaria  uma pré seleção de perfil , logo após as pessoas selecionadas iriam ser encaminhadas para  o gestor da vaga.

Porém, a forma conduzida não favoreceu uma leitura adequada do meu perfil, achei deficitário o modo como a pessoa o realizou.

Espero ter ajudado com esse feedback.

J&J é e sempre será um excelente lugar para se trabalhar."
"Deve dar o retorno para seus candidatos que aguardam por uma oportunidade de trabalhar na JnJ.
Recebo de apenas algumas vagas o retorno.

Despite receiving this survey I was never contacted by J&J for this recruitment process.
"Despite of having a very good CV, I have never heard from J&J TA team. I recommend promply feedback to applicants."
Describe all the position's requirements. In my case I did not have VISA to work in a particular country however in the description you didn't mention you don't support for VISA.
"Descrever de forma mais clara as vagas, contatar os candidatos para uma entrevista pessoal e dar oportunidade para que ele possa mostrar seus conhecimentos e experiências adquiridas.
Os candidatos só precisam de oportunidade para mostrar capacidade."
"Depending on the candidate's formation it is a little bit difficult to find a specific function. For example I am a biologist with a doctorate in biochemistry and experience in herbal chemistry and tissue culture. I'm sure I can contribute to a company, but I do not know which function is most appropriate for me. 
Perhaps it would be interesting to simply have a resume submission option and leave the job of determining the function for the recruiting team."
Deliver response to the reasons why the candidate is not selected and make it easier to understand the Spanish environment of the website
Deliver a reason why I am not a good fit for the position.
"Deixar mais claros os critérios de seleção dos profissionais. Me inscrevi em cerca de 8 oportunidades na J&J e não fui chamado para nenhuma. O pior é que eu fiquei sabendo das vagas através de vocês, eu que recebia emails de vocês sobre as vagas, me informando que eu tinha o perfil para concorrer a estas vagas. Como eu tinha perfil e ninguém me chamou? 8 vezes??
Nunca recebi nenhum contato da empresa, nem para dizer por que eu não fui chamado nem mesmo para uma conversa inicial. Vou cancelar minha inscrição nesta empresa."
"Deixar claro, quando o cargo é para homens e mulheres. Não sei se isso é erro ou não. Mais a maioria das vagas de Pesquisa e desenvolvimento vocês preferem homens. Acredito que tenham suas necessidades e explicação para isso. Mais enfim, tirando isso a equipe de recrutamento é ótima. Estão de parabéns todos. "
"Definitely have the attention to inform why not, was selected, this would serve too as improvement"
Decribe better the reason of why you were not a good fit for the position
DECREASE THE TIME IN SELECTION
Deberían llamar o enviar un mail comunicando que no sigue en el proceso o como sigue el proceso. 
"Deberían de contactarse, al menos telefónicamente para confirmar datos del CV."
"Deberían avisar por cualquier medio, que yo no sigo en el proceso de selección.
Should notify by any means, that I do not continue in the selection process."

"Dear Sir,

Firstly  thank you for  asking my opinion.

Just to clarify ,I hadnt  had any interview,  just received a feed back that I would not go for next step..as they have already choosen the  candidate for the process.

I appreciate the feed back, but felt so sorry I couldnt  attend an interview in order to  show and talk my experience.

 Hope  in future I can  have other opportunities.

B. Regards!"
"Dear Sir or Madam,
From my perspective any long process , such as the case,  should be tied with a communication plan internally (which I can not testify for obsvious reason) and extenally (my case) , nothing too complex but just to acknowledge that the process still running and valid and you are in the Long, short or final list.
A four month process which you receive an e-mail confirming your participation in the very beginng and another that you were not selected I believe that has room for improvement......... I know, I Know that dealing with human nature and mainly human expectation it is a never ending herculean task, but when you are touching in a way people dreams and expectation for improve their lifes from my own learning expirience we should be more sensitive in any possible form we can.

"Dear recruitment department,

In my opinion JnJ could analyze the candidates not only by their graduation or previous experiences in the required area, but also in their background and previous jobs experiences. Many times a candidate that do not have the required qualifications for the job offered have much more to offer based on their commitment and personal skills than a candidate with a theorical knowledgement.

Sincerely yours,

Denise Pereira Guimarães"
"Dear JnJ Mr. Sjoerd Gehring, thank you for asking me this survey. 

The recruitment process for a position like this ""Senior Manager"" Business Technology Leader, could have an opportunity for candidates to be listened. 

My suggestion, is to organize a conference call, using some collaboration tool as skype, or any other.

I guarantee a 30 minutes call could be very productive for both sides and also not so hard to organize the agendas of recruters and/or hiring BU leaders.

In my case during this process and my interest in JnJ position, no one contact me, but I really appreciated this survey opportunity.

Considero que debería informar oportunamente del avance en el proceso de postulación al cargo; indicando en que etapa se encuentra el postulante para así poder evaluar el nivel de consideración del postulante para el cargo.
"Considering that I only received comunications via e-mail I had no chance to know the next steps of the recruitment process So I can not give constructives opinions.
On the other hand I think the Johnson & Johnson Talent Aquisition is a very good tool and give us a clearly view about the jobs and the objectives of the company."
"Considering a personal opinion I believe J&J could keep more in contact with the candidate about the progress of the recruitment process.

Also I’d say it would be interesting for the Talent Acquisition Team to take a step forward to invite more people to interviews, also including people that might have alternative bachelor degrees but that could also have very interesting  job experiences and specializations to add, which could make them a strong potential to add to the job opportunity considered, including the possibility to get more ideas out of the box in a determined job position.

In the overall, the recruiter was kind to me and whenever I asked, she got back to me, so I appreciate the attention of the team.
Thanks for the opportunity and I hope to work in a close future with the J&J team!

Agradezco que mi opinión sea importante para la compañía, creo que su proceso es exigente y muy preciso y me gustaría tener una oportunidad para aportarle a la compañía mis conocimientos en el área contable y financiera isa como mi experiencia

"buenas tardes.
se que es difícil este proceso y complejo para la evaluación de candidatos para cubrir la vacantes que se publican, pero mi comentario se centrará en las promociones de Ethicon (ENDO e INC) ubicadas en Cd. Juarez Chih. México.
Me gustaría que Rh. fuera el único encargado asignar el mejor candidato a X promoción dependiendo el perfil de la vacante.
y no como se maneja en estas plantas que los Ing. o el dueño de la vacante, son los encargados de escoger el candidato de la lista filtrada por Rh.
basándose en otras cuestiones menos importantes o que no son parte del perfil
por que no ver la manera que este proceso sea mas transparente.
Gracias!

 "
"Buenas tardes.
Desde mi punto de vista, creo que deberian tener una inetraccion mas especifica con el empleado o posible empleado. Manifestarle las razones por las cuales no es candidato apto para el puesto ofertado por ustedes como empresa. De esta manera creo y es mi apreciacion personal, la persona trabajaria en esas debilidades para que en un futuro pudiese nuevamente manifestar su deseo de trabajar con ustedes. "

"Bom dia!

Fui bem atendido pela seleção e recrutamento, nada a questionar.

O que poderia melhorar, é colocar no seite um banco de dados para as áreas de produção.

Pois nunca sabemos quando abre vagas nas produções da Johnson.

Só tem vagas acima de produção. "
"Bom Dia!

Creio que não há o que melhorar. Apenas lançarem no sistema as demais vagas disponiveis em todas as áreas, e não só para os portadores de deficiênica.

"Boa Noite!

Creio que para melhorar o processo, deveria ser aberto oportunidade à pessoas que tem experiência na função, mesmo sem um diploma para comprovar curso, até porque, a experiência adquirida no dia a dia tem maior importância do que um diploma...
Dada a oportunidade para me expressar, gostaria de pedir por favor uma oportunidade dentro da empresa para participar de um processo seletivo, independente do cargo. Tenho experiência em fábrica (linha de produção, atendimento pessoal e telefônico), sou dedicada e literalmente visto a camisa da empresa. O bem estar da empresa, obviamente significa meu bem estar também. Segue abaixo meu currículo. Aguardo um contato positivo.

"Better detailed reason. I have to confess it was better than most companies that are not providing any feedback.
"
Better detailed feedback.
"Better communication. They don't provide any feedback about the process and when you send them out a message, they simply ignore you. I have some real cases in my last applications. Once, I was contacted by the recruiter who is based out from Peru asking for information, I sent her out all requested info and then, I never heard back anything from her.
For this specific position of Functional Lead - Sourcing, Sr Manager (000017XN), I wasn't never contacted by HR rep. I simply got an e-mail with the rejection letter.
Clear communication isn't a common process within your recruiters."

"Better communication with the candidates. Recruiters most likely don't provide any feedback via e-mail, during the process. "
better communication with candidates
Better attention with employe
"Best regards, I would love to have the opportunity to work in this beautiful company since I had a friend who worked with you and I have the best references. Thank you"
Best Regards!!! 
"Besides the emails as a confirmation to had received the postulation, the team who is leading the recruiting process should inform the applicants of their hiring status in order for the applicants to know if they pass to the next stage or to tell if the recruiting process has been cancelled or finished. For those who continue, it would be helpful to appoint a talent acquisition contact in order to provide accurate information for the next steps or even some suggestions or advice will be highly appreciated considering their high expectations and interest to get hired.

The letter purpose is to suggest to J&J some changes or improvements on its recruitment process. Based on my experience, I would like to receive more information about the process, if has ended, continues or cancelled. 
In the same manner, If a candidate is pre-selected within all the applicants to continue in the process, would be very good and nice to be contacted by a Human resources team member or a kind of account manager in charge of the recruitment to give you the good news that you keep on race and even to encourage you to improve or consider some aspects at the time to get interview, this will make the difference and would be well received by the candidate. 
In addition, would be very helpful if HR send you practice tests or quiz to practice related to the position they are looking for. 
Finally, might be awesome if they consider to hire the best 3 candidates for 3 months to see how each one performs and make the best choice.  With the other 2 candidates double check if fits for any other position in the company.


To summarize, better communication between the involved parties (J&J and applicants) would gain better results in the recruitment process.
Finally, please receive, in advance, my gratefulness for considering my opinions."
"Besides hiring me, the alignment process is still subject to a filter unknown to both insiders and outsiders. Recruiting for a position comes not only from CV profiling but skills evaluation. I recommend you to implement automated skills test online."
Bem a little bit faster in processes updates.
"Believing more that a senior candidate may still have a lot to offer.
Thank you.
Cesar."
Being polite and explaining the reason for why I'm not good enough for the job position.
"Being more specific in pin point the reasons why you weren't fit to the position offered. I know the person that was the chosen to the position and I think that my experience is similar to her and I have a relevant experience in management of latin america projects. So that is it.

"Be professional about the recruitment process, if profiles record via web site are not to be considered then shut down the option, no follow, no notification it is highly disappointing for a company such as J&J."

"At least to give a Feedback related to the process, I didnt received any e-mail or contact."
"At least the recruitment process in Chile is luckly of feedback about further steps of the process.
Actually I contact them about a month after my second interview asking for the status of the process for the position as KAM.
Almost 2 month later I recieved an email notice I wasn´t sellected.
Is something to concern how such a big company as J&J falls in this matters of time schedules and feedback for appliers."
"at least take the opportunity to contact the candidate most of what i have experience is that no contact has been made to my self or to other people i have told to use the site, it aint fair and is just plain difficult to at least have an interview........regards"

At least let me know why I was not accepted 
"At least J&J had told me that I'm no longer into the process, but I really don't know why. It's a company that I want to be part, however I want to know where I need to improve.

At least it's important to contact the applicant for knowing with more details the job position as well as the recruitment process. Unfortunately I couldn't know any of them.
At least inform that recuitment has come to an end and anither person was hired. Or that the position was cancelled.
"At least give minimum proper an ontime feedback, the process is extremely unpersonal, totally cold...unfortunately....lots of room for improvement...."
At least give feedback
At least give a professional feedback to who applied to the position.
"At least contact your candidates because HR is part of your face to world, your image, if we're showing interest in your company, in my opinion we deserve the same interest from your HR people. a plus could be to know why we weren't selected and not only receive a common mail informing it, and more than a month later from when you applyed for the position.

As same J&J provide a feedback about application. It's very important to send a feedback for a candidate positive or negative. I don't receive any feedback about this process.
"AS IS, IT´S  OK."
"As I did not participe process of recuiment, it will be unfair to say something about it

But after filling out some questions and receiving feedback to check the process, it's good enough.
"
"as far as my little bit experience about your recruitment process, i found it effective and efficient. Keep it up."
"as far as i experienced, i found your recruitment process very effective and efficient. "
As far as I concerned would be polity to send some feedback. 
"As after I sent my resume for he position of Latin America Program Lead - Janssen (JANSSENLA200117), this is my first contact with Johnson, I have not enough information and knowledge about your recruitment process to give you my suggestions.
After some steps more I will have information to suggest you some improves for your recruitment process.
Very best regards,
Marco A. T. de Castro"
"As a recommendation, I would definitely indicate which position a candidate has been rejected, for example in this case the heading doesn't indicate it and I applied for 2 different roles. I still don't know if I am still in the process of the other job application.

As a leader pharma company it was expected to have a feedback when the candidates submitted an application. The reason why a candidate was not considered to move forward in the applied process is important to the person looking for opportunities in a very established company and reputable image. Also to the company as J&J is a good approach to have an analysis about the gaps between the profile asked versus the applied forms in order to understand the potential talents available in the market. 
As a form of importance of the person who participated in the process or the beginning of it an opportunity.
"As a candidate, I'd like to receive some return about my participation in seletive process and also receive feedback with the reason to not fit the position."
"As a applicant, I didn´t receive any answer from the J&J Recruitment team neither any email for this vacance. It is a kind of disappointment. Sorry. "
Appropiate feedback to candidate prospected in order to make clear the reasons to not select the person for the position.
"Applied for job with great fit on skills, experiences and requirements. Even with internal referral, never heard back from recruiter"
"Após alguns minutos após ter me candidatado a vaga,  recebi o retorno por e-mail de que meu perfir não se encaixava para para a vaga em questão. Sem nenhum contato telefônico e nenhuma justificativa especifica, de forma que ficasse claro o motivo pelo qual meu perfil não se encaixava na vaga. Enfatizo a falta de contato e justificativa devido a ter 10 anos de experiência no setor de Customer Service adquirido em uma grande Multinacional.
"
Apenas feedback para o candidato negativo ou positivo
"Ao término da seleção de currículos para a próxima fase, quem não foi selecionado poderia receber um email, mesmo que automático, informando a desclassificação. Obrigada!"
Answers about recruitment process to candidates could be a good start.
Answering candidates even if the answer is a NO and a brief note about this 
Answering 
Answer about the applications.
"Analyse the CVs. I applied to more than 3 positions, and NEVER got a feedback. I don't think my CV could be that far from what J&J expect for one interview. I was recommended by collegues internally J&J and even in that way there was no return."
"An aligned communication flow and timelines can be an area of improvement.
"
"Am very dissapointed with the selection process, I was never contacted by any recruiter to explain why I was not selected for any of the positions I applied for neither I was invited to join the talent pool. 

I received feedback from P&G and they did invite me to join their talent pool, these actions remarked how much they care about keeping candidates for further selection. "
Always provide a feedback. I'm sure the way you communicate (or not) is how people will perceive your company.
Always provide a feedback to the candidates and explian the reason why they were not selected for that position.
"always give the feedback, even if it is a bad response."
"Always candidates ask for feedback and a good follow up of the process, in my case, it was through the Manager of the Division and sometimes HR, then i didn't receive news from anyone, when i called my surprise was that not only the manager but also the hiring or talent people didn't work there anymore so no one knew about my process and i lost it, i was on the final steps, one interview more and never knew what happened not a single feedback from anyone.
It was very disappointing, although i still like J&J

It is also important to know the salary you would be offering as well as the benefits that the company offers."
All good
"All de process is done for e-mail and believe that is good, because is faster.
I think should have less answers standard, explaining the reason od not to be recruited, but is requer much time and people to a work without profit."

Ajulisar el proceso 
Aiming at the company's culture regarding the treatment of staff and community in a more humane way this could also be taken to the side of hiring new employees.
"Agilizar na resposta de espera, para as vagas postas."
AGILIDADE NAS RESPOSTAS DE EMPREGO.
"Again, a call phone..."
"Again, a call on my phone would be more clear."
"Again (this is the third time), I WAS NOT contacted by any recruiters so far ... Not to hear I'm fit, not to hear I'm not fit.
I don't think my resume has ever been looked at...
It's a pitty, because I really would like to join J&J - it's right the next neighbor, I'd like to work for a company that provides health or wellbeing for people, and has a name.
Thanks for asking anyway...
N"
"After the interview I was told that they would contact me soon with a positive or negative feed back, but I didn't get any feedback until 2 weeks after the interview, it was just a standard feedback e-mail, which didn't explain the reason why I wasn't fit for the position. As they said they would contact me soon, I sent an e-mail to the HR person in charge for the position and for my surprise I didn't receive any replay at all, not even a phone call.
I understand the J&J is a huge company and the HR department must e very busy, but I expected a bit more humanity from them, not treating the candidates as numbers.   "
"After collecting all the resume go through it one by one thoroughly . Most of the HR are not done that part end to end.

Call the candidate to inform whether that person got selected or not , because everything is not possible to see through mail or text. Moreover it can be expected from a world recognised company only. 

For an example  i have more than 19 months of work experience in Genpact India pvt. ltd. in Accounts Payable ( P2P ) , and the number of positions for which i have applied , 80% of those job activity are same to my profile but i did not received any call .

The recruitment process should be legitimate and fair for each an individual.

 "
After applying to the Recruitment Process I haven´t heard about my case until now. It will be nice to have notify candidates if they are being counted in the procedure and also being able to see the stages of the process to visualize where you are standing.
"After a sent my resume to Johnson, this is my first step with Johnson recruitment process, due this situation I have not enough information and knowledge about Johnson recruitment process in way to send you my suggestions for you improve your recruitment process.
After some more recruitment steps of Johnson recruitment process, I will have information to evaluate your recruitment process and send you some suggestions.
Very best regards,

"Advise the principal reason because wont considerated specially for a job, for knowledge and anothers applications"
Actualmente no veo alguna mejora para mejorar la contratación. 
"Actually, I think JJ might be more ambitious about the profile of the people he needs. Resumes are not always outlined capabilities, the benefits and the desire to learn and succeed. I wish I had the opportunity to show my skills and my desire to learn to achieve mutual benefit."
"Actually, I don´t know the recruitment process so I´m not able to say anything about it. the only thing was good for me was to receive this survey to answer.

Regards,"
Actually make contact with qualified prospects.
Actually Jhonson and Jhonson have not contacted me yet. I hope to have good news soon.
"Actually it is a good process, I have nothing in mind to recommend you."
"Actually I already applied for many positions (more than 20) at JnJ, but I never had been called for some process, so I have few or almost no arguments to perform in relation to JnJ Recruitment Process."
"Actually contact candidates, either to participate in the process or advise that they are not been considered. My issue is that I was never contacted, not even to disconsidered my application. The only communication received was that my application was received and now this survey, that makes it difficult to evaluate because never got any communication from the recruiting team."
Actually Call you
Actually call people
Actually call or inform the candidates of the process
Acredito que uma entrevista de imediato.
"Acredito que todos nós devemos melhorar constantemente,quem participa do processo fica ansioso, provavelmente está em situação vuneravel de desemprego ou com gênero..Sugiro que se coloque data para inscrição como também data final do encerramento do processo."
"Acredito que pessoas com conhecimento e perfil muitas vezes pode agregar valores e resultados positivos para a empresa, e nem sempre a ausência de experiência deve ser um fator de ""corte"" para o processo de seleção. Existem muitos profissionais com ótimo perfil e que estão em busca de uma única oportunidade para se desenvolverem e alavancarem dentro da empresa. 

Abs."
"Acredito que para melhor recrutamento e pricipalmente para vaga de PCDs todos candidatos deverião ser convocados pois desta forma o recrutador avaliava o grau da deficiencia/limitações de cada um e em seguida a qualificação para vaga disponivel. 
Quando uma pessoa vai se dispor para uma vaga ela tem que ter o minimo de conhecimento para realizar o trabalho, devido a isto a exigência deixa de ser necessaria.

Acredito que o retorno sobre o Stafus do processo possa ser mais rápido.
Acredito que fornecer mais dados sobre o que no perfil não estava em acordo com a vaga.
"Acredito que deveria dar mais oportunidades pra quem ainda nao possui experiência, pois muitas vezes são bons candidatos mas que não trm oportunidade de entrar no mercado de trabalho pois a experiência é requisito."
"Acredito que deve realmente avaliar o currículo enviado, para um melhor aproveitamento dos candidatos."
"Acredito que a importância do recrutador entrar em contato com o participante da vaga é necessário, visto que o mesmo pode melhorar no quesito necessário. Um e-mail fica muito vago."

"a)Comply with notification commitments
b)The denial by strategy is not an ethical answer for those who want to get a job
"
"A way to improve the recruitment process is to provide feedback, with that prospective employee can improve for the next opportunity  "
"A successful selection process is one that is well planned and structured. Even if you do not have an industry or a specialized company for the selection, it is important to define in advance all the phases for which the candidates must pass before they conquer the vacancy. How many steps will it take? Who will be responsible for each of them? What questions and tests will the candidates have to face?"
"A simple written feedback would have been enough to meet my expectations. No answer leaves always space to wrong conclusions and images.

Best regards Maite"
A personal contact to inform me the reasons why the person is not an appropiate candidate. The actual  way of notification is only a standar mail.
A more engaging process like contacting with a personalized email/communication would be nice
A more accurate feedback. Saying why the candidate was not selected  for the position. This way Johnson & Johnson can help us out in the persuit to achieve success on our career. 
"A Johnson & Johnson poderia realizar um processo seletivo com os candidatos dando assim uma chance de conhecer pessoalmente os mesmos.
Assim a empresa veria de perto o perfil de cada candidato."
"A johnso & Johnson poderia dar algumas oportunidades para alguns do que estão se candidatando, em fazer algumas experiências em algumas de suas fábricas.
Em questão ao ponto 7 que dei em que considero favoravelmente a Johnson & Johnson, é por que não tive oportunidade de ter uma experiência em alguma fabrica, então sendo assim não há como eu dar uma nota maior."
"A job/ career is key and a serious process for most individuals, so a minimum amount of personal contact / feedback from the company receiving this type of very personal-confidential information is expected 
The fill process used by J&J is too long, and a simplified version could be useful as a candidate pre-screening, to be complemented with the full process only to those final candidates, saving time for everyone, including HR."
A job opportunity...
"A JnJ sempre dá retornar sobre minhas aplicações, com isso mostra um profundo respeito por mim! "
"A J&J poderia enviar as características necessárias para assumir o cargo que não constam no CV do candidato.
Poderia também, disponibilizar as fases do processo de contratação, para que o candidato possa se preparar e tomar ciência do seu progresso."
"A honest feedback process/conference call can be useful for those who really wants to be part of JnJ.
"
"A great majority of the job posting I have applied to, ended up cancelled. I have applied extensively, without no interest from J&J, even though being extremelly qualified, I have never been given the chance of a personal interview, or have a I received a phone call. It seems unreasonable to me, to advertisse Jobs extensively, just to turn them inactive a few months later.  I believe that more time should be given in assessing the headcount and the true need to expand. The exposure is definitely being negative to the Company's image."
A good process feed-back includes at least a contact by fone if you are approved or no.
A faster reply
A entrevista foi por telefone e penso que isto não é suficiente pra avaliar o candidato. 
A direct contact from the recruiter providing feedback to the candidates.

"1. The recruitment engine should be more assertive. Commonly the recruitment engine sends me e-mails considering my profile fits this or that position, but some weeks later I receive another e-mail informing my participation has finished due to ""a better evaluation on my profile"".

2. The processes take too much time to run. They look like they get stuck for some bureaucratic reason. In my opinion, if the decision to hire someone was already taken, the HR people should do their best efforts to deliver fast and with quality to the hiring department."

"1. I know two or three people who did not comply with the profile; though they were contacted for an interview. If you are filtering people (age, ex J&J, Location, among others), why don't you say so in the profile? The time of people who takes time to apply is as valuable as the time of J&J workers. 

2. It would be good - for the sake of the business- if recruiters start treating people as people. Calling or emailing someone and telling them why they were not a fit for the job would be valuable. It will make them know which skill they need to improve and will apply with more accuracy next time. 

3. Recruitment processes have become a matter of internal recommendations rather than getting the best talent available. I think transnational companies are loosing the opportunity of recruit the best talent. In Colombia, even the J&J workers tell you that without a recommendation is almost impossible to being interviewed.

What can Johnson & Johnson do to improve the recruitment process?
😄
"Zero follow through.  But appreciate the experience, it was good to see how the culture there is.  Thank you kindly."
"Zero feedback from J&J.  If you want to improve the process, engage the people applying!
 

After applying for a senior position based on an internal referral, I received a generic email from a recruiter acknowledging the successful submission of my application.

I replied to the recruiter asking about the timeline, but never received an answer.

I never received any information on whether a person actually reviewed my application/resume.  No one at J&J told me I wasn't qualified, or wasn't being considered.

No one from J&J contacted me after the initial, generic email.  However, I have received four surveys asking me about my experience during the recruitment process.

How do you improve the process?  Engage the person!  

The only reason I know the position was filled is I reached out to the J&J employee who referred me.

Overall, a very disappointing experience with a company I thought would be a great place to work...

"
Zero contact or follow up after application.
"Your website is dated and horrible.
You clearly post positions that you are only complying with EEO and have no intention of interviewing people for (you already have a candidate)

AND? I was informed a position was filled 6 months after applying. SIX MONTHS. That is disrespectful and ridiculous.

At least look like you actually care okay??"
your team is working fantastic
your system seems very impersonal.
"Your survey stinks I was never contacted by a recruiter at all.  You really should design your survey better and maybe you'd get some information out of it that would actually help.  

Since Johnson & Johnson didn't take my candidacy seriously I don't appreciate you wasting my time with your survey.  "
Your screening process is obviously out-dated.
Your response time to a submitted resume is poor.  I have over 15+ years of all levels of recruitment experience and can not understand how I can not be a good fit for your company and without an explanation I continue to second guess the reasons why.
"Your recruitment process was a long wait, then a standardized email telling me that you are pursuing other candidates.  I never received the first opportunity to pursue your opening, nor be seriously pursued as a qualified candidate.  Like many organizations in today's world, Johnson & Johnson has fallen short of anything resembling a professional interaction and vetting process.  Please improve your recruiting process as you are losing out on very qualified and talented individuals."
Your Recruitment process is pathetic. I have been working in J&J as contractor for more than 16 years. During this period I applied for several Jobs. Not even a single contact was made by your recruiters. All I got is a system generated email. I wonder how your  recruiters are making decisions which resume to pick for managers to review. I have been working directly with Several Directors and VPs. They all loved to hire me back & forth for their projects. Some of the directors tried to push my recommendation but your recruitment process is such that my resume was not even picked up. Later I was told by hiring managers that they have not even seen my resume. 
"Your recruitment process is flawed.  It lacks fairness.  Your recruitment team did not even say why my profile did not match your requirement when everything in my resume is exactly what's in your ad's job requirements and role description. Equal opportunity should always be practiced. Not subjective, not biased. "
"Your recruitment process is fine, mostly electronic so I would assume there is high volume of applicants.

"
your recruitment process is best than all other recruiters.
Your recruiting process is very disappointing!  I was excited about applying to a couple of job postings on your website to find out within a couple of days that both roles were put on hold or eliminated.

Your recruiting process is very disappointing!  I was excited about applying to a couple of job postings on your website to find out within a couple of days that both roles were put on hold or eliminated.
Your recruiting process is a black hole.
Your recruiting group needs to make sure they reach out to applicants to let them know that they have not been chosen for the interview process.  A general email stating your qualifications do not match requirements of the job should be the least they do; especially when the applicant was referred by someone from your upper management.
Your recruiters obviously don't understand the positions they are supposed to recruit for and make broad decisions based on automated resume reviews
"Your recruiters are totally task oriented.  As a hiring manager for 20 plus years previous experience and contacts were never my primary reason for hiring.
I look for attributes, transferrable skills, high energy level, persistence, self-direction, analytical people who are problem solvers.  Do yourself a favor, get rid of the resume software and start actually reading the resumes.

Dear Gregg Rasor,

Thank you for your interest in career opportunities at Johnson & Johnson Services Inc.

We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Senior Patent Counsel – Vision Care (0833161114) at Johnson & Johnson Services Inc.

We encourage you to continue to review the job openings posted on our careers web site at Careers. We also suggest that you periodically update your personal career profile so that it reflects your most current career interests and preferences. Please be sure to read our entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to our web site. Also, be sure to read our Legal Notice.

Thank you again for your interest in Johnson & Johnson Services Inc.

Sincerely,

Johnson & Johnson Talent Acquisition Team

******** END OF EMAIL TEXT *********

Frankly, I was shocked because my background and experience significantly exceeded your job requirements. I may have scared off the recruitment screener with my salary, $183,600, as CTO and General Counsel of a business.

I believe your initial question on salary was an above $151,000 range type answer.

Anyways, salary is not the issue.  I did not expect you to cover my $183K, or the $350K I made as the managing partner in a law firm. What I wanted is to contribute materially to the J&J portfolio and business in medical arts and devices.

Did anyone actually bother to read the patent I attached? It was a 1st action allowance for an OK (othrokeratology) contact lens. I wrote it for a friend, licensed it, then eventually sold it to Bausch & Lomb for him. Value, over $50M.

The complete lack of a professional response shocked me particularly since I had read several postings from Sjoerd Gehring, long before I explored the J&J web site for job opportunities. I was impressed with Sjoerd's ideas and writings, which led me to believe that J&J really had their act together with respect to legitimate technical hiring and talent assessment. Well, I guess Sjoerd's writings were too idealistic, and are not really implemented at J&J.

Accordingly, I drafted but did not send a letter to:

Johnson & Johnson
One Johnson & Johnson Plaza
New Brunswick, New Jersey 08933

Attn: Michael Ullmann
      Executive Vice President
      General Counsel

Why would I care about letting your top legal officer know anything about your screening and hiring process, particularly since I was summarily rejected?

Well, I was the first patent agent (that's an engineer with a patent registration before the USPTO) in Motorola's 1989 program to become a top 5 IP producer.  As part of that effort, I was responsible to hand pick over 200 engineers that I sent to law school, creating quite an effective organization that created over $10 billion in significant IP rights. Of that staff, many are now heading organizations like Apple, HP and the like. Personally, I took another less ambitious path because of family and friends. 

Thus, I have some idea of what makes a good Patent Attorney.

In summary, I will follow this response up with a letter to both Michael Ullmann and Sjoerd Gehring. It is my hope that this response will create a better environment for future J&J applicants.

Best regards,

Gregg Rasor

"Your process was very disappointing for such a reputable company. Just like most other sales jobs in the industry today their are nine million recruiters out there and always getting people to apply for jobs, yet you never talk to anyone half of the time. In the medical industry you need to speak to someone directly on the phone or face to face. A resume in Medicine and Health does not tell you a story or someone's true background or strengths and weaknesses. For instance mine is one. You guys are such a well rounded and reputable company, but your Recruiting process does not reflect it. With that being said, just because of how great of a company you are I will always be open to working with you. With that being said please keep me in mind, I live in South Florida, I'm a go getter with a Sales Background, I'm also an RN, BSN, and have served all my time in critical care/emergency/trauma, and I am always looking to settle down with a company such as yours.

"Your process need HELP! There is not a way to check on your application and its status. You have to go to the email confirming that you applied (no path from the website). When you do finally get in most of the applications are not updated. I have jobs from 2013 that still say ""under review"". Some jobs I interviewed for I never heard back from. AT LEAST GIVE THE CANDIDATE A YES OR NO. It's common courtesy. "
Your process is straight forward and easy to follow.
"Your process is non-personal and slow. This survey is proof of that. I didnt use a recruiter, I found the position on Linkedin and applied via the company website. This survey doesn't even explore how I applied. I never had an interview. I applied for 3 jobs, which I know I'm qualified for and each time I got a computer generated email after about 6 weeks saying no thanks. Then you have the nerve to ask for my feedback on your recruitment process, twice. Your process is flawed and outdated. Try moving into this century and at least have a phone screen, then make a determination. If you can tell via a resume that the person isn't qualified or a good fit, then have the courtesy to send an email from a real HR person in a timely fashion."
Your process is no different than that of any other company.  Post a job.  Solicit resumes.  Respond with a generic reply.
"Your process is highly impersonal.  I am providing you more feedback than you have provided to me.

E-mails come from 'Global Recruiting' or 'Johnson & Johnson Talent Acquisition Team'.  If you want people to feel any sense of affinity toward your brand, put a name to communications even if it is the program generated e-mails that these were.

Provide some degree of courtesy and respect to applicants.  I didn't respond to a survey request and after one week I received another robo-generated e-mail request to complete this questionnaire.  Compare this to the fact that I submitted an application and heard nothing for four months, at which point I received an impersonal e-mail correspondence.

Johnson & Johnson might be the best organization in the world for which to work, but your recruitment organization does not seem to do anything to communicate that message."
"Your pay scale for experienced talented oncology sale representatives is way too low.  In fact, I consider it insulting. I was not rejected by J&J,  I declined to continue with the interviewing process because your pay is too low.  I have earned a higher base salary.  I am very very good at what I do! "
"Your loss  u did not interview nor hire me.

B well  take care"
Your job descriptions are not clear and you have very poor communication also your repeated requests to fill out surveys are annoying after you fail to respect me with any feedback on my application you expect me to give you feedback on your process 
Your hiring process is perhaps one of the most opaque and glacial processes that I have ever encountered.  Anything you could do would be an improvement.
"Your Generic Process is really bad. I cant believe that your Acquisition team or managers would allow this. Your team is asleep at the wheel representing your organization. 

Hire me, Fire the guy who allowed this 360-771-1244 Antonio Rocha Miranda II 

In Bachelors of Sceince classes for Healthcare Administration this is called firing forward. Out with the people who don't care in with the New who do care. "
Your departments have serious disconnect
You've done nothing.
"You will need to read this important message.

DOUG GRAY WAS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR MY EXECUTION OR EXTERMINATION FROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA


#DougGray @UUtah Childrapist racist xenophobe homophobe bisexual transgender bully https://goo.gl/2gucfN

Christians are the greatest bane on earth....   

I have good reason for this.... as a successful foreign medical graduate there was no tolerance in Christian Mormon dominated Utah USA and I was exterminated eliminated or kicked out whatever you may want to call it... this is soft terror... this is soft genocide...   

I do not care about any of that but the fact that I felt used... the fact that I was exploited will never ever go away...   

TRUTH: Christians exploit to convert... if they find nothing they at least make sure that they pull the plug on some essential aspect of a successful person so as to make sure that there is a person who will save and thus convert... making sure that Christ or the Lord is the only savior... 

What The Fuck... yes WTF...   

Read about Christian corruption at https://goo.gl/qs23Hf   

Also Read about my true happenings while in America https://goo.gl/P56QyV   

Great to make your contact....  

Many terrorists are going to be born and raised in the US and exported all over the world from now on !!!
 
May the GODS and GODESSESS bless you your family and all your extended family that have been wrongfully converted into the wrong religion....   

Take care

"You should've hired me I would've been a great employee. Please reconsider. 

Thank you,
Brad Lewis"
You should take jobs that people have applied for and remove them if they are not a great fit.  Then you should take their skill set and match them against potential careers that are vacant.
"You should take into consideration the experience of the candidate in the topic that the job is mainly focused on.

I have the impression that the person who reviewed my CV didn't know much about the main skills required in the job description and didn't understand the relevance of my experience for that job. In other words, a more informed judgement on my experience, would make the case that I should be considered for the job.

"
You should hire me. I work with several of your reps increasing their access and market share. 
"You send me jobs that fit my background and experience. why don't you have a person look at my resume instead of my resume being rejected by a computer program. I one time worked for one of the family of companies, and what bothers me is that I can not find a job in any of the other family of companies in my area.
Please have someone from HR contact me. Thank You"
"You really need to communicate better with the applicants, especially in the areas where this reviewer gave you very low scores."
You people must give chance to overseas professional candidates as well who has average exposure... Sometimes polishing the medium or average candidates becomes very good asset to the company...
"You never looked at my resume.  I have world class experience at some of the world's best companies, and I could have helped you this year.  

Like most big companies, your recruiting process is either broken, overwhelmed, or only a facade.   

I bet you an ice cream, coffee or a beer that no one reads this and responds.  Email me at john_a_hartnett@yahoo.com to claim your prize.  Thanks."
"You never contacted me, and you are asking for feedback. Strange. "
You never contacted me either way. 
you never contact the person directly
"You never considered my enormous credentials and talents in the healthcare
industry.  This is part of what I believe to be a deliberate corporate process in
America to blackball individuals who have been convicted of a felony, irregardless of their potential contribution to corporate productive.  Your refusal to explore my. patents with regard to clarithromycin needlessly sentences millions of patients to death with an error of omission."
"You never called, interviewed or contacting me regarding the position."
You need to respect candidates more and take them seriously and povide true reasons why you keep ignoring their applications for years?? Is it because they are Muslims or from Middle Eastern routs or what exactly???
You need to have personal contact along with the rest of the recruitment process.
"You need think out side ""the Box"" Resume  and think of what a person with a wealth of experience can bring to J&J "
you must have to mention the reason of not selecting the candidate and it will be appreciable if you give chance to under develop country candidates.
"You might meaningfully respond to candidates whose credentials you solicit.
Alternately, create a short screener of the candidate profiles before you ask for more."
You have to take more staffs to check each and every applications thoroughly.
You have best process of recruitment.
"You have a lot of nerve turning down and applicant and then asking for a survey.
Take this survey and stick it you know where"
You have a good recruitment process. Keep doing what you're doing.
You had an amply qualified candidate but your operation was not willing to invest in any sort of discussion. That shows laziness and a willingness to not treat people well. If that's how you treat people then that changes if I purchase your products.
You guys don't know what you are doing. Happy to elaborate. 
"You fall into the unfortunately universal group of ""skimmers"". You don't actually read CVs; you skim them and thereby miss some extraordinarily talented people. Your process is more a cattle call than a sincere effort to find the best. "
"You do not have any recruitment process.Other than the initial confirmation message of receiving my application, I absolutely heard nothing from anyone recruiter or hiring manager thru email or phone call. Not even a regret email or notify me the status of the position. is this what you call recruitment process???
 "
"You did not reach out to me for the opportunity.  I am a seasoned sales professional and would make a great asset to your team.  I do not have any oncology experience however, I do have a proven extensive track record of success in selling in many different clinical areas.  The ability to track, follow-up, and close a physician is universal.  You should really give me a chance to at the very least interview me so you can see for yourself."
"You did not call me for this position. 
I think you may have sent this email out by error.

I did apply but was never contacted by your organization nor was I contacted by a recruiter. So that's I don't know why the survey was sent to me. I am still interested in the position if you would like to reach out to me.

"You could've hired me, but that ship has sailed. Your loss."
"You could try to treat all your applicants as people.  It is simple humanity to acknowledge an application, thank the person for their interest and say we'll be back to you within ____________ weeks.  It's 2017 you can do it automatically, if you really wanted to.

Similarly, if a person doesn't go to the interview stage you could probably send a nice thank you for applying note with 5 clicks.

Of course everyone who gets an interview but doesn't get selected should get a communication.  Yeah it's a form letter but it at least shows appreciation for the candidates interest, after all, they came to you for the interview.

Of course the selfishness of J&J, and their complete lack of consideration to any candidate is the fact that this survey is the first acknowledgement I have received that J&J even got my application, let alone wasn't selected for an interview, let alone didn't get the job.  What selfishness on your part!!  You ask me to rate a practice where I never even got an acknowledgement that you got my application.  What arrogance.

Well at least I know now I didn't get the job."
"You could maybe not treat every type of job the same. This was for a senior level role, and I received template emails."
You could introduce into probing questions better suited to the role for which a person is a candidate
You could improve your recruitment process by not automatically ruling out candidates based on having too much experience in the field. Please look at the breadth of industry experience as being an asset to your sales team and not an automatic trigger to rule someone out for consideration.  
"You could even consider arranging some face to face interviews via Skype so that rather than CV, you would be able to get to know more about the applicant's talent and so you can offer them a better position. "
You could contact most applicants and let them know where they stand.  Discuss how well they do or do not fit the position.
You could call me for a position.
You could call candidates you discard explaining the reason.
You could be faster with the results. 
"You could acknowledge that I didn't get the job and provide an explanation before sending me these useless, corporate surveys.  This was the only communication from J&J"
You cant control the managers hiring selection in the end.
You can try to put the job placement in a clearer way and then provide a feed-back of the reasons for not being called for an interview

"You can tell the manager Caitlin Ryan that she should have been more professional and courteous to someone like me who helped her team in Brooklyn as a clinical liaison with some very difficult Dr.'s. 

She should have replied in a more timely fashion and not kept me waiting for 3 months to hear back from her. 

She should have shown alittle more respect for a former Janssen fellow such as myself."
"You can stop using computer generated screening tools and filter through some of your better candidates who have way more experience to add to your organization than someone who may be forging a resume to slip through a computer based screener.  Happy to discuss in person, but seemingly will not be given that chance."
You can start by scheduling me for job interviews.

You can personally call the applicant or send them a polite email 
You can improve the recruitment process by calling the applicants instead of sending an email.
You can improve the process by making sure that a person gets feedback on an interview.  If they don't get an interview aleast give the canidate a call or email stating why nt choosen for the interview. Also there needs to be some type of process where managers are not allow to hire their buddies when there are more qualified canidates in the interview pool.
You can improve recruitment process by letting candidates know if they got position before sending this survey
You can give me at least a chance to interview and show my skill-sets versus just plowing on to the next person that may have more experience but probably is a less motivated candidate.

You can ask your recruiters to pick up the phone and give some positive feedback. 
you bid a on a position through OUR Source and never hear anything again; feedback would be nice
"You are the worst at the recruitment process, and I have an MBA and 20 years marketing experience! "
"You are sending me a survey about the recruitment proces and I have not been contacted by a recruiter or received an interview.  With this e-mail I assume I did not get the position but I have not received a communication to that effect.  That said,  I still think very highly of J & J.  You may want to have some check the process flow for when surveys or communications go out.  "
You are one of the very few companies that send the auto reply thank you for applying but we selected another candidate.  Looking for employment process is already overwhelming and time consuming letting candidates know you filled the position helps them move on and be informed during the process. 
"you are doing a great job interviewing talents whom are not referred from insiders.
I would like to thank you for the opportunity and sadly I wasn't a good fit based on the second interviewer. 
I still think I am, I would apply for any opportunity hoping the best
Thanks"
You are asking me for the survey but didn't bother to inform me that I am not selected OR what happened to my candidacy. No HR dept is bothered to inform applicants about recruitment progress. 
"Yo u could simply hire me, and avoid the recruitment process all together."
"Yes, it would be better for you as an employer to be fair and honest in your recruitment process.  If you think your talent search process is flawless then I am confident that no other candidate could have been more qualified than me.  But still you did not consider me for this position.  If anyone who lost something here is Johnson and Johnson not me."
Yes
"Years ago when I was at a career fair, the J&J representative told me to just apply at the website.  There were no opportunities to network or sell yourself.  It's the same impersonal and bureaucratic type of recruitment at many big companies."

Would very much like to be called for an interview and get hired.
"Would of been nice to be contacted since I have worked this territory for 10 years and have many relationships in place with customers.

Got initial email that received my 
posting to it and then 30-60 days later an email that it was filled "
Would love to see more communication between the 2 people and if a job is meant for someone who already works for the company don't waste every bodies times in doing the job process.
Would like to see better communication from HR/recruiters
Would like to receive sime feedback. 
"Would like more of a reason for not being considered other than the standard automated email message.  Especially for those who have more experience or years in industry than others.  I've applied to J&J several times and not once received a call back, but as a consultant through different firms I've been brought on board and worked out tremendously.  I understand the volume and automated process but more clarity for not being selected would be nice. "
Would like feedback on the interview?
"Would have liked the recruiter to provide more information up front regarding the phone screen. e.g. I wasn't sure if the phone screen was with a recruiter or with a technical person who was very familiar with the position I applied for.

Also would have liked the recruiter to provide a reason why I wasn't a good a good fit for the position but I never heard back from him."
"Would have liked the opportunity to speak with someone to discuss qualifications or possible opportunities.
ISC"
Would have appreciated a response regarding my submission other than a survey to let me know I have not been selected.
Would be nice to hear why I was rejected.
Would be nice to get some kind of feedback on what one could do to improve their skill set for future postings 
would be nice if the recruiter would contact and discuss the role with the job seeker
"would be helpful to know if considered for job or not. radio silence is lame, even for a big company. "
Would be great to be contacted in person when being referred to a position by a J&J employee
Would be good for HR to inform applicant of status 2 weeks after application.
Would be beneficial for the potential candidate to know where they stand in the process of candidacy. 
"Would appreciate if giving a chance for an interview.
An interview helps the employer and the candidate a way of getting and giving the knowledge learned.
If one has the experience and the education needed for the position than what's the difficulty in getting a call or an interview date from the interviewer.
Thank you."
Would appreciate feedback on the Application and follow up on next steps - Thank you!
Worst HR and Recruitment process.
"Worst experience of my life, incredibly unprofessional."
Worst experience of my life!
Worse place to apply for jobs. Not sure if there are any recruiters working.  Get response after 6 months. Never came across company that is so slow. Not sure if it's laziness or recruiters don't care. Will lose lot of good people. Need to get rid of workforce management altogether If no one bothers to respond. Never applying again.
"Working for another large pharmaceutical company for many years, I would like to have an opportunity to discuss my qualifications and areas to develop for upcoming positions at J&J. I believe it would be best for the longevity of any organization to meet with industry with 6+ years of relevant experience and provide feedback as you may be missing out on many high quality candidates. All the best to you and your companies, I do see a lot of value in what you do and how you accomplish it. With a few tweaks here and there, I believe it can even be better. "
"work with incumbent directly, not focusing on resume only"
"Work with applicants to understand their value add, be candid about whether they perceive their is a potential fit and anticipated timing.

Thanks for sending survey."
work on communication. there was no communication of any kind in this process.you missed a great candidate.
"Words cannot describe how I feel about J&J right now.  For three months I applied to jobs relentlessly.  I have a PhD in Pharmacology/Neuroscience with extensive background in the sciences, clinical trials, and interaction with the Department of Defense and FDA for clinical trials.  Every response was a rejection, likely automated.  I was never approached by a recruiter, asked about a position, or invited to career events. I'd be surprised if any of my applications were viewed by human eyes.  For this reason, I feel you lost out on an opportunity to have a dedicated career-oriented employee working for you for a very long time.  I can only hope this note is reviewed by human eyes. "
"With the hiring process as it is today, using filters and word searches, not sure much can be done to improve or change the recruitment process.  What lacks today is the personal interaction that is not always gleaned from a computer sorting resume's.  I recognize with the high number of applicants it is not always prudent or possible to have that personal interaction.  This appears to be a case of adapting to the times."
With the experience that I have I was very surprised that I wasn't selected for an interview.  Of course I don't know if I was the best candidate for the position but I really can't understand how my level of experience did not warrant at least a phone interview!  
"With some of my previous work experience I could actually provide some detailed information, but I'm not going to spend my free time doing so for nothing."
"With proper documentation and training to those providing rejected candidates, elements of improvement for the candidate (with no legal repercussions) . 

Thank you for the survey and the opportunity.  
I will continue to look to J&J for other opportunities.  

"
"With other companies if I am not qualified or if I am no longer in consideration, I would receive an email stating that. With JnJ I don't ever hear or see an update on the status of my application. "
With my strong background it is hard to believe I dont fit for any of the 5 positions I was candidate. I believe I received no feedback because I am brazilian. I believe J&J could give equal opportunity for any nationality since they are a global group.
"With My expertise, I'm surprised I never get anywhere. I was even willing to relocate at my own expense."
"With 27 years nursing experience, I think I deserved at least consideration instead all I received was a do not reply we are not considering you."
Wish they would just give us courtesy call and give you a little more detail as to why you didnt qualify for the job instead of just getting an email that you did not qualifiy for the position. I have a applied for the same job multiple times one manager told me I qaulify for the job but cant seem to get one of the positons that I have applied for.
"Why send out these surveys, where there are no contacts from HR"
Why I should care when this is the way you are doing your business?
Why don't you have me come in for a one on one and we can see where I am a good fit within the company.
Why do you want my input as a candidate when you have not treated me as one? What kind of process is this?
Why bother your just going to hit ITLDPs
Why bother your just going to hit ITLDPs
Why am I getting this survey over and over again when I was not selected even for interview? Can somebody please get back to me?
Why am I getting this email?
"Why am I getting a survey for a job that I applied for that never called, emailed or sent a letter stating the status of my application. Really doesn't make sense. "
Why am I even getting this for a job I didn't even interview for?   This is useless and not sure how it even benefits you?  Spend more time retaining your own employees rather than surveying the 100's of employees who applied on indeed or wherever for a particular job.  
"While it is impossible to provide commentary/feedback to every single person who applies for a job, I think providing that insight to those who ask for it would be extremely helpful. It would enable the candidate to hone skills they are lacking so they may be prepared in the chance that a similar opportunity presents itself in the future.  Thanks"
"While interviewing with the director, I felt like I was not listened to. I was asked the same question a few times and ahe said she was sorry she was busy doing two things at once. I was not given a reason as to why I was not a good fit. "
"While I was told that I was not a good fit for the position, I was not told why."
"While I was contacted via email that I would not be a good fit, a reason was not provided. I do not look at this too negatively though as I'm sure J&J has many applicants. I am grateful to be given a hard no as other companies simply never respond to my application."
"While I respect that there is a high candidate volume and that a recruiter cannot connect with every candidate, I find it favorable when a candidate is at least notified via email they are not being considered for a position. 

In this scenario, I applied to a position, never heard anything back and then was asked to complete this survey 4 months later.

J&J has a very favorable reputation; however, more open communication to candidates could help improve the recruitment process.

Thank you!"
"While I received this email to give my opinion about the recruiting process, I never received a call from a recruiter, had an interview scheduled or were interviewed.  This was a position I had applied to but did not hear back from J&J except for this survey and an email stating I was not the candidate being considered for the role.  Based on the questions in this survey, I either never received the contact from recruiting that I was supposed to, or the survey was sent to me by accident.  J&J remains a company which I would love to join and will continue applying for opportunities.  "
"While I realize that the company recieves thousands of applications, it would be nice to get a little more detail of why you didn't get the position instead of a generic ""we went with someone else or direction"". Thank you and I will keep looking for a good fit at Johnson & Johnson. 
Keighley Cotonio"
"While I did not move past the phone screen stage of the process (I felt strongly that I would be a solid candidate but recognized I was not an ideal fit due to lack of experience in the product category) the process was the most professional I have experienced in my search to date. I was contacted within a week of my phone screen, thanked for my interest, and told why I was not selected to continue in the process. Compared to my experience with other companies (many large with similar resources to J&J) where there is often not even a confirmation email that an application was received or zero follow up after initial interviews my experience with J&J was extremely positive and reinforced my desire to work for the company in the future."
"While I did apply, I was never contacted about the position."
"While I can appreciate the need for surveys, I'm not certain that this survey is best suited to someone who applied for a position and did not hear back from J&J.  With that said, if someone actually does read this.  I would still welcome the opportunity to speak with the recruiter and/or hiring manager about the position.  JSVISZOKI@COMCAST.NET; 732.690.1111"
"While I believe Johnson & Johnson is likely a great company to work for and I was more than adequately qualified for the position, I was not contacted by a recruiter for this position. Had I been, my above score would likely have been better."
"While I believe I'm a strong candidate, I also have an internal recommendation but have not received a call from HR. I'd love the opportunity to talk through my experiences but everything is automated and a phone call could go a long way for J&J as well as the candidates. "
"While I appreciate this is difficult, more connection would be preferred. I was referred specifically for the role I applied to and I got the generic email 'no thank.' "
"While I appreciate the opportunity to provide a survey, I would have enjoyed a response from someone about the position prior to this survey.  I assume that I have been removed from the interview process, but I do not recall every having received any response one way or the other."
"While I appreciate that I received an email letting me know that they would not be pursuing my candidacy for the role, it would have been helpful to know the reason why."
While being processed for a different position I wnet through the background check. There were some problems that needed more information - communication with the checking company was very difficult. This caused me to spend money on backup documents that were not required.
"While as a marketer I hold J&J in fairly high regard, the recruitment process leaves a lot to be desired. After I applied for the role on March 17th, I heard absolutely nothing until I got a generic email on April 18th saying: ""We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Senior Brand Manager (Contract) (9567170210) at Johnson & Johnson Inc.""

As a candidate who meets 100% of the stated job requirements and takes the time to complete your horrifically cumbersome online application process, I would have in the very least expected a more detailed explanation as to why I wasn't selected for an interview. I also would have expected some feedback sooner than a month after I applied.

The recruitment process very clearly demonstrates itself as highly inefficient, which makes me wonder how much of the organization is plagued with the same.  It doesn't leave me with a positive impression of the organization."
where possible provide feedback on why the candidate is not selected for further consideration
"Where is the Human Side of HR ?  I understand you receive hundreds of apps for each position which makes almost impossible to review each one, I assume your are using software to screen candidates which promote wording manipulations trying to use key words, I am pretty sure J&J is an attractive company no doubt about it however recruitment process in general is missing the human side of potential candidates who can bring experience and value to the company. "
"Whenever I apply for a position in J&J, I am just getting an email saying ""We are not pursuing your candidacy"" without mentioning any reason.

If a reason for rejection specified in the email, the candidate will get an idea what might be the wrong and candidate will correct his mistakes next time. 

Please provide the reason for rejection in the email. "
"When you reject a person, STOP sending them warm and fuzzy emails and surveys. Really?????"
"When you have qualified individuals applying for jobs, it would be nice to receive a short e-mail rather than a system generated automated one
I have applied for positions at J&J but till today nobody has contacted me to discuss my background and how it related to the job requirements. I have an MBA with an MS RDN."
When you get zero feedback after taking the time to apply for a position and get the very un-personal thanks but no thanks and that is if you hear at all. The application process seems to screen out candidates without a person ever seeing the candidates qualification through a few computerized question.  
when you don't even get an interview for a role...there is no feed back.
"When you deal with professionals, be professional!"
"when you are a highly qualified professional , a human being should speak to you on the phone regardless of the effort it takes.  Why is my time to fill long applications worth less than an administrative level bureaucrat phoning and giving me feedback about what might be a better fit for me and what is J&J really looking for."
"When you already have a contract person that has proven their ability to exceed sales and win the Pinnacle award for their employer while promoting Janssen products, and has the relationships established in the hospitals and as a nurse, PLEASE strongly consider how that candidate can hit the ground running on behalf of Janssen."
"When the hiring manager was contacted via Linked In he said he would be in touch but when I followed up 2 weeks later he informed me that the position had been filled.  I was referred by a current employee but was never contacted in except with a stock denial email days later.  I understand the volume of applicants must be hard to handle as it is with many large companies.  A courtesy contact for referrals would be nice.  A system generated update informing candidates that applications are closed or interviews are in process, etc. would be great too."
"When the candidate requests the hiring manager name, the recruiter should provide it, and not act as the gatekeeper.  The hiring manager best knows what he/she is looking for, and the recruiter has only limited information.  Furthermore, the automated resume reviewer may miss some skills/experiences clearly listed in the resume, as it may not be looking for these items, thereby missing an opportunity to diversify the talent pool of available applicants."
When the automated email is sent back letting you know that we are not pursuing you as a candidate that they provide the reason.
"When someone repeatedly applies to the company it would be nice to let them know why they did not meet the needs of the company.
For example I contract for JnJ for about 3 years and they love my work but I get turned down for every position I apply to with no reason."
"When someone applies for a position with your company, send an email that the person was not selected before you send a survey email. "
When someone applies for a position inform them if they are being considered or not being considered. If they are not qualified or a good fit give reasons or suggestions as to why or how they can become a good fit. I have been told by recruiters and HR managers that my credentials are top notch for a Supervision position or Operations Manager level. Just looking for honest feedback. 
"When recruiting for senior roles, great your applicants with a higher degree of inclusion and feedback. Currently, your screening process is extremely impersonal. "
"When recruiters do call and are unable to reach the candidate, providing call windows will be appreciated in order not to interrupt their outreach."
"When people apply, let them know either through emails or calls, whether they are moving on in the interview process."
"When I was an office-based representative, I participated in several recruiting events. Understanding the needs of the company in terms of skillset and personnel gaps is tantamount to building the next generation of leaders. After applying for several positions and having served as an office based rep and hospital-specialty rep in two separate regions with Jansen, a courtesy call from a recruiter would be thoughtful. I would take the role of recruiter as the cornerstone for any successful corporation. My experience in the field and written/oral/discerning skills would partner well with the vast needs in this region. I'd entertain a call to apply for the recruiter's job, so far, their inaction proves flaws exist."
"When I read the email I wasn't a suitable candidate, I was thrilled the recruiter choose someone that much better; I do however would like to know any feedback so I can grow and develop to apply myself to future roles. 

Thank you. "
"When I first resumed applying to J&J, I was receiving responses in about 2 weeks. Currently, my experiences are very similar to when I first started applying and would never hear anything back. 

It would certainly be good to have a more active ""dialogue"" regarding my potential candidacy."
"When i did my interview with the Regional Manager, he didn't seem very engaged nor like he knew how to interview someone. I knew just with this interview i didn't want the position just from that guy"
"When I apply for jobs that I am clearly qualified for I don't even get a call. Then I get sent jobs that are not even applicable to my qualifications asking me if I am interested... Not sure how the automation for your search engine is set up but I don't think it is working very well. I am not the only one which has had this issue.
Thanks,
Anna Maria"
"When I applied, I received an automated reply letting me know J&J received my application, which was nice.  That was the last communication I had until I received this request to fill out the survey.  Based on this survey, I assume I was not selected to interview for the position."
"When having phone interviews, the need of webcam is necessary and the hiring manager should be included."
"When employees of the company post for a position in the company, it is only common courtesy for the recruiter to provide some type of response.   The J & J recruitment process makes a mockery of the J & J Credo.  I'd rather be told that I am unqualified than to hear no response.  This has happened to me a number of times and in conversations with colleges I have found the experience to be universal.  J & J does not seem to value internal talent. "
"when declined for a position, give alternatives"
"When candidates are a great fit, they should give them a chance and interview them. Right now it seems as if they only hire those that are recommended through an employee referral and do not give the online applicants an opportunity for employment. "
"When candidates applied for a position, they are not notified of anything.  With the time that passed, then it is assumed that the candidate was not considered. 
 Please, notify the candidates, at least, when they are not considered.  If a reason of why are not considered is given, it is much better.  Not sending any notification, makes the candidate feel ignored and not important."
"When asking for Work Authorization, include all visa types. For example, an E-3 visa (for Australian citizens only) is required to work in the USA; but does not require sponsorship by the employer as all costs are borne by the applicant.The default options do not allow for this selection."
"When any company outsources it's HR department, then you get second rate service. "
"When an non employee logs into career site, it would be helpful to
See a total for number of people who have already applied"
"When an employee is appling for a role, serveral questions are asked about previous experiences, background , professional interests,... Ussually candidates take a lot of time of preparig these answers and in most of the cases put a lot of enthiasm in being part of the process. As one idea to get some improvement on the processes and help employees to be better prepared and engaged for next opportunities in the future:  when an employee is dicharged for one process, we should be given a personal feedback about why his/her candidature is not selected, not only an email saying that he or she is not delected to be in the process. This will help him/her when looking for new opportunities in the future, which one will be a better feet for them or the areas they need to address to get ready for that kind of positionsmoving forward. Ultimately it will be a great gesture to show we care about our employees, their development and their career."
"When a potential employee is referred by several current J&J employees for a role they are clearly qualified for, at a minimum, the potential employee deserves a face to face interview and if they do not get the role, the potential emoyee and those references deserve a follow-up."
"When a manager maintains the stance that they are a rational person and use rational approaches and thus suppress their emotions, it can create a dysfunctional and schizophrenic organizational culture. The supervisor, manager or director may believe themselves to be technical and rational yet they are often irrational.

Furthermore, when biases and prejudices are rationalized in the guise of policy and procedure, it can be stressful and frustrating for staff. "
"When a job applicant applies for a position, have a recruiter contact them and interview them.  If they do not fit the criteria for the open position, give them the decency of letting them know and what they need to work on in order to meet the criteria for the position."
"When a candidate submits through the online system. There is no place to list all the employees who currently work for J&J, who would all give references. This process feels like the sorting out of candidates is an automated system by choice words and not based on the individual candiates. Perhaps a recruting process which includes personal feedback and input. Thank you for soliciting my feedback to improve your interactions with potential candidates.  "
"When a candidate apply for a position, if they are not selected at least send an e-mail that they were not selected. And if the candidate has not been selected, don't send them survey links."
"What recruitment process.   you apply to a job, the application goes into a black hole.  Puff .. no more."
"What recruitment process are you speaking of?  I submitted my application and never heard anything back and now I continue to receive emails asking me to rate my recruitment experience.  If this is an indication of how your organization functions, then I am not interested in working with you.  Thank you.  "
What recruiter? No one ever called me
what process. Did everything on line. never was contacted by a recruiter.
"What Johnson & Johnson can do to improve their recruitment process is to provide serious consideration to those beyond the stringent pre-qualifications set out in the parameters of the job posting. For instance I have been tested and have genius status with an exceptional proven track record in business development your organization has missed. The bottom line is job performance, that equivalent or greater experience trumps an education. Johnson & Johnson lets those of us with these exceptional qualifications slip through the cracks; missing out on the benefits I could provide.  "
"What is the secret to getting a job within J & J without having a referral from temp agencies, i.e. Aerotek, execupharm, etc. "
"what is extremely wrong is with situation/position and the process is the fixation on having a degree, a piece of paper that states you obtained further education and debt versus work experience that trumps that piece of paper.  I will not apply for another position (even after it was recommend by two managers) with JnJ and would not recommend anyone else for a position unless that type of discrimation were to change."
"What I did like is the fact I heard right away what the decision was on my resume. That is a fabulous practice because even though I didn't even have an interview, I knew within days of the decision.
"
What can Johnson & Johnson do to improve the recruitment process?
"What a joke, send me a survey when your automated system flushed me out? You should investigate a better process as your allowing exceptional talent get away from you. Good luck."
"Well, there was no recruitment process per se.  I saw the job listed on a job site and applied, but never heard back either way. I am guessing that I did not get the job based on getting this survey. Thanks, Elizabeth Lamont, MD, MS"
"Well, the position I applied for was canceled before I was interviewed for it, so in the future J&J could improve the process by following through with posted positions.  (That being said, with my background in ""Big Pharma"" I understand how positions can suddenly disappear.)"
"Well, other than the standard acknowledgement for applying for a position this is the first correspondence I've received.  So, I'm not too impressed with Johnson and Johnson."
"Well, maybe a recruiter could contact me. In my 15 years of searching for a position at Johnson & Johnson - I have only been contacted once."
"Well, just for the record, I did not find this opportunity via a recruiter.  My application and resume was submitted through a job board on line.  Thank you for posting the position so I could submit my desire to join the J & J team!"
"Well, it seems as though the recruitment process is just a formality.  Probably positions have already been targeted internally.  There's nothing wrong with that, it's just the way things are done.  I just wish that they would inform you that you were not chosen for the position."
"Well, I reached out to the recruiter by email and LinkedIn and she failed to respond. I never received notice that I did not receive role. Unsure why I never was contacted for a phone interview. I didn't find out that role was filled until my former colleague told me he received Role."
"Well, I have applied for positions, I never got to know why I am a fit for a position or why I wasn't. I meet the requirements and entry level/ experience merit but still nothing.

I mean it's still a great company to work and travel for. "
"Well, I applied to the job over a year ago so my recollection is sketchy.  However,  I do remember doing well in the interview and being told that I was a good fit for the position.   I even commented to my wife that I ""nailed the interview.""    I was disappointed to get the standard ""other candidates are more suited"" form letter.  

Please coach interviewers to be non-committal to prospective candidates.  

Best regards,
Hal Canter"
"Well, follow-up with everyone who takes the time to apply at Johnson & Johnson.  Thank you."
"Well, first I was not contacted at all about this position. I heard nothing from anyone about getting an interview/not being selected. I think there could be some improvements made in the response to potential applicants. "
"Well you can contact the candidate, first to review experience and knowledge and let know how the process will be conducted, and second to acknowledge if candidate had received a not applicable letter."
"Well of course an answer without more information about the recruiting process like number of people that apply and other data will be just a speculation.
And because I was not elected it will also be bias.
"
"Well I was not invited for an interview or anything so I can not say how the process is. I wish I was invited. I visited Jlabs for a site visit from Salk and I loved it. Hope I will have a chance to work for you.
Thanks,

"Well I used to consider Johnson & Johnson one of the very best positions in the country, but since they never took the time to acknowledge me or even email or call me about the position I applied for then I have a different view point on the organization as a whole.  Companies and corporations are getting too big and no paying attention to the people who keep them in business nor are they even bothering to reach out to all candidates to see if they are a great fit for a position with their company.  I am very disappointed in the way the recruitment for this position has been handled.  I hope that an executive decides to read this and start a new hiring process.  A process that only involves a couple of people and not an entire staff to make a decision.  It doesn't take 3 or more interviews to find a great fit.  It should consist of 1 to 2 interviews max.  Thank you for your time."
Well I must have applied to close to 100 jobs at Johnson & Johnson in the last 2 years.  I just do not know where I am missing the mark.  I would like to understand.  In one case a recruiter asked me if I knew someone that would be good at the position.... I was like what about me I since I was the one who applied... with no real response.. she just asked me for what jobs I applied for... and then nothing else... 
well I haven't heard back since I applied so some communication would be nice.  But I also understand it has been &lt; 2 weeks since I applied...
"Well I have not received any kind of email of johnson & johnson talking about the last position that I applied, then I really don't know what I say because all in this survey talk about if the recruiter contact me or sent me the reason.

However I think that johnson & johnson is a great company to work."
well i have not been approached yet by anyone from this organization yet that I am aware of
"Well first of all, I was not invited for any interview for the position of Sales Strategy Manager. This survey comes as a surprise to me since I did not get a chance to go through the recruitment process for this position."
"Well defined process with feedback for candidates to improve.
"
"well considering i was qualified for the job but didn't even get an interview my impressions are not too strong about J & J.

"
Well as for myself i have applied on a number of occasions and haven't had one interview but this 18 year old applied and got a job.
Well - Honestly !   I guess if J&J  brought me on board I would not feel the way I do.     I am really talented  please have someone call me Ed Quinn 631-553-1068
"Well - apparently I make too much money to apply for the position. The recruiter said that I wouldn't make as much money as I am currently making and I was completely fine with that but she said that never seems to work out. I disagree with that strategy. I have always been used to surrounding myself with the best people and not concerned with the compensation. If J&J truly is amazing company with great culture then consideration should be given to the candidates that are the best fit no matter what their compensation is. I would have gladly taken a pay-cut to be part of the amazing team at J&J. I will continue to watch the J&J job boards for opportunities.

Thanks

As I said before, I was never contacted so I'm unsure if your company already does this. If it doesn't, I can guarantee you are missing out on acquiring good talent from across the nation. "

"Was never contacted once throughout the process.  I had a very strong resume and had the Secretary of the Army as a recommender for the positions I applied for and never received a call or any feedback during the process.  A simple email or phone call would have been highly professional.  As an experienced professional and Veteran I would expect more from an organization who proudly supports Veterans.  I was truly disappointed and hurt by this.  I am currently employed by the state of NJ who truly took care of me and brought me into their family.

I have 20 years experience in pharmaceuticals. I do not apply to any jobs to which my experience or interest is not a match. It's unbelievable J&J does not believe I am qualified for at least a couple of these jobs??  I believe J & J is a good company otherwise I would not keep applying. However, with every application and the ""No"" that inevitably is emailed to me I just don't know what it would take to become a J&J employee. "

Since I know this offer and acceptance can take quite a long time, it seems I was never considered at all and that they had already known who they were hiring before the process began.

I went on to decline the invite for a telephone call as I was not able to make any of the 2 appointments proposed to me, thanked recruitment for contacting me and asked if I could be kept in mind for any future roles to which I was ignored and received an automated email a few weeks later saying I wouldn't be considered.

View candidates on qualifications not age
"Video interviews are inefficient, did does not give you the interpersonal connection, I feel it was very systematic and extremely impersonal. "
Video interviews are impersonal and do not get the best out of the person. If you can not take time to interview the person directly over the phone or in person then do not ask them to interview. It was a waste of valuable time as the video interview had numerous errors which lead my interview to be stressful and unproductive. I see this as your loss as you may be losing great talent due to this ridiculous interviewing process which is impersonal and pointless!
Very unprofessional hiring process. I did not hear anything about the process. Very disappointing recruiting team.
Very slow process.  Took over 6 months to get back to me to inform me that the position was filled.  
"Very rude response. I feel that no one looked at my credentials closely and took the time to discuss with me just my skills and my experiences, before making decision. There is something that is happening there, may be my name that has turned your company off from recruiting me. I wish I can argue my case before being hung without a trial. "
Very poor timeliness on status updates and feedback.
"Very poor communication.  I only received an auto-generated email indicating that the job posting was cancelled.  Upon further digging, I self-discovered that the position was re-leveled as a D1 and reposted.  It would have been nice for my application to have automatically been passed through to the updated posting.  And if I didn't already have a relationship with the recruiter from a different posting, I would have had no idea what was going on."

Very hard to know why I was not selected for the position I applied to. It would be a good idea to reach out to applicants and describe why they were not selected for the position they were interested to.
Very good recruitment processes
very good process to hire people according to their eligibility
Very discouraged that even though I met qualifications and experience in specialty and was previous jnj employee for 12 yrs I was not contact by recruiter. The guidance that you can be currently employed but couldn't have more than four yrs experience to be considered for job.  My division was sold off I was not terminated or quit.

"Very disappointed in this process.  I was rejected 1 day after applying for this position, and never heard anything beyond I was no longer under consideration for this position.  Very disappointed in this process"
Very cold process
Verbally communicate to internal employees stating why they were deselected. . 
Verbal interactions would have been warranted given the level of years of experience in healthcare 
Value combination of experiences and educations.
"Vacancy announcements on J&J site could include name and contact details of the recruiter responsible for the particular process. As a candidate, it would give me comfort knowing there is a human being on the other end, someone I could contact in case of questions. Answers to initial questions that a candidate gets when reading an announcement could help the candidate decide if he /she wants to proceed with submitting an application."
Usual auto rejection with no details
Using Company HR to screen applicants instead of recruiters.
Use the telephone
Use the system you have in place. Just communicate better.
Use the survey results to improve process. 
Use recruiters who can communicate in English what the particulars of the position being offered who will return to J & J with information about prospective employees and be able to work on negotiations between J & J and the same prospective employees. I felt that my concerns about the offered position were not properly addressed and in the end broke down.
Use real human beings instead of some matrix to weed out people on paper. 
"Use of talent acquisition as first screening is more equitative. 

"
Use more robots to screen and sell your products.
Use indeed's auto apply feature
Use feedback from your survey
Use experienced recruiters to conduct interviews. The should at the minimum be well informed of the subject matters. That will help them identify potential candidates.
Uploading multiple documents to the user profile can be confusing. I was unsure to upload documents for each position or to upload docs for my general profile.
Uploading multiple documents to the user profile can be confusing. I was unsure to upload documents for each position or to upload docs for my general profile.
Updates regarding process. The position I applied for was eventually cancelled.  But even then it was months between applying and any contact
"Updates on status of application process would benefit applicants who never know if hiring managers have had opportunity to review applications. HR makes decisions on what applications hiring managers see or not. There should be a mechanism for managers to have the opportunity to eliminate applicants based on their qualifications and skills, rather than HR make final decision on screening of applicants."
updates in status of applicantion
Update your prospective employees in a timely manner.  If positions are no longer recruiting they should be removed from your website.
Update when positions are taken longer than the usual timeline. 
Update the site when roles have been filled and notify (automated) applicants (automated) when they aren't moving forward in the hiring process.
"Update the requirements for the position so unqualified people aren't applying. 
There was no communication from the recruiter whatsoever.  "
"Update the job postings website to show positions that J & J is currently looking to fill, rather than having the listing of every job posting in the last year. Additionally, I have met the job qualifications posted for multiple positions and have only received denial letters. I am interested to hear what the positions are actually looking for."
update the candidate with the next step in the hiring process. Send emails of new openings and positions that would be a suitable match to their profile.
Update candidate if they are selected or not selected.
Update application status.
Update applicants to advise them of their status
Update applicants regarding process. Phone interview was given however no updates following phone interview.
Update and forward applicant of application process.  Perhaps HR can suggest other positions at Johnson & Johnson that could be a better fit for such candidate. 
Untimely responses on the status of the application. I feel that application is not reviewed.
Until this survey was sent to me I didn't know I was rejected as a candidate. I feel qualified and would have liked feedback as to what I was lacking  thank you
"Until I received an email stating that I was no longer considered a candidate, I received no communications or notifications of any kind from anyone.

Except from the initial electronic notice that my application was successfully submitted, I was in an information vacuum for well over 6 months."

"Unfortunatelly, I need to conclude that Johnson & Johnson does not take in
account achieved education (in my case executive MBA from University of Pittsburgh) nor offers career development in a different area than the individual holds currently within the company. I have finished my MBA while working full time at my job as a contractor for J & J office in Prague while taking position of Learning Management System Admin for the whole EMEA region. I took my personal annual leave and paid all my costs myself for my studies. Despite that fact I got finally no offer for growth within my current department nor I have been accepted for number of other positions I applied ...even for a sales rep in my hometown Bratislava, Slovakia. I believe that the selection process if a person comes from CEE region within EMEA is not based on achieved level of education not personal ambitions to develop and grow within the company. I believe there are different measures taken into account during selection process ... where does the person come
from...I always thought that one can get forward in an international company such as J & J thanks to his/her level of achieved education, ambitions for personal growth and his/her set of skills and traits. Unfortunately, my experience with selection process after applying for number of positions within J & J just proves to me it is not true. I know that nobody in TA HQ will care about these lines and that I will just get another automatically generated e-mail as any other. Despite that fact I felt need to write these lines whoever will read them. Sincerely,

"Unfit notice should be sent out earlier, and a specific reason why I was not a good fit should be noted either to me or the employee who referred me.  Discouraged to reapply for other posts. "
understand how the candidate is eagerly waiting for response and give him/her feedback timely
Unclear as to where in the recruitment process JnJ is for this particular role 
Um..... I was never contacted by a recruiter. I did apply online like 9 months or so ago and heard nothing. So based on this survey it looks like I was supposed to have been contacted by someone and had a interview. Never happened. Not sure what is going on with you guys getting a survey like this. It tells me you guys are disorganized and have no idea what is happening within your system.
"Um, fix your process. I was never called for an interview yet you are sending me a survey suggesting that I had. There was no way you could score high and this survey result should probably be thrown out..."
"Two things come to mind in my own experience.
First, I had to hound the hiring manager for a status on where I was (I was not selected). I was left feeling like they would have preferred me to just ""get it"" that I wasn't selected and quietly disappear. Because I persisted, she set up a call and told me. That level of respect after a series of three in-person interviews should have been automatic.

Secondly, I was told I was beaten by a person who was ""better connected to J&J"". I took this as either an internal candidate or a ""friend of"" someone. Either way, if it is a forgone conclusion, why waste my time? And it also doesn't square up with the hiring manager's manager who at the end of the interview told me I was at the very top.

So lots of setting up big expectations to only be let down. This seems to be the modern game, but it doesn't make it right."
"Two items:   I keep applying for jobs and they get closed a few days afterwards.  Very  frustrating 

2.  I keep applying for jobs that I very qualified for and I never get called.  I write to the recruiter and they do not give me a good reason on why they will consider me for the job.  I am very good at what I do.  I have the resume,  the creditials and the reputation to be able to make a difference.  I love to work at JnJ.  Both of my in-laws worked there. My father-in law is a retiree.  My son was the youngest intern a few years ago.  They all spoke highly.  Just frustrated that no one is taking my resume seriously.   Extemely frustrating "
Try to speak with the applicants instead of their resumes as you only know about their previous work through resumes but not their passion towards J&J.  
"Try to really analyze experienced Professionals, and try to fit them in your organization.
Feels like ATS does most of your work."
"Try to personalize the process rather than being the faceless, nameless, voiceless system that most big companies use."
Try to make the process more personal. 
Try to make the process a little faster 
Try to give chances to freshers like us
"Try to get in touch with and interview as many applicants as possible that are highly qualified for your vacant roles. Since I don't think you are, you are probably loosing out on both great talent and credibility. I even contacted your TA people through Inmail (Linkedin) to express my deep interest in a role. I get regular international calls about very similar roles from companies and HH worldwide. In this case though, I heard nothing from anyone at J&J, except from this automated survey. What impression do you think I have of your process? "
Try to expedite the overall interview process.
"Try to communicate more with candidates, even when they were not selected. "
Try to call the person fill the form or apply for the position.
Try to call the candidate and inform them of the status of recruitment.
try to bring follow up response to 100% after applying on line
Try to avoid cancelling positions you advertise for. You get people excited about a position and then cancel it.  Sad face...
Try to at least interview by phone to the candidate before make decisions of rejecting. 
"Try to accomodate people and quick to reply. No discrimication to all applicants, color, races and disability"
"Try responding to resume that fit the position. I have a lit of experience and your company never contacted me or let me know the status
"
Try recruiting people based on skill rather than friends of current employees. Your recruitment process is a joke. 
"Try providing a recruiting team which provides at least a minimum of communication with the applicant.  Never heard anything other than the 
""thanks, but no thanks"" correspondence."
Try interviewing the person before sending this email to them.
"Try interviewing great candidates instead of hearing nothing,  then sending an auto-generated rejection letter. Again,  I am under degreed and over qualified.

"Try giving people a chance, call them, speak with them, dont just end the opportunity based on what is written on paper. People dont buy from reading white papers, but rather the interaction. If this was not the case you wouldnt be in need of sales reps."
try contacting the client to see if they ever received a call or an email before asking them for feedback
Try actually contacting the candidates instead of sending a survey. 
Try actually calling your applicants back (even if it's a non offer) before asking them to fill out a survey of your shitty hiring/recruiting process.. take care
tried follow up after the 1st interview by phone. The recruiter never came back nor with an email or phone call.
"Treat the candidates with respect.  Don't forget that you're not the only one conducting interviews. The candidates are interviewing you and your company as well.  In my case, Johnson & Johnson failed miserably.   I was 100% qualified for the few positions I applied for and yet I was never given a reason why I was not picked.  For the only interview that I was given, I sat inside a small room next to the front door.  You didn't even have enough respect to bring me inside and conduct the interview in a conference room.  And when I was rejected, I wasn't even notified that I wasn't picked.  I had to contact the hiring manager to get an update.  For a company as large as J&J, you have a lot to learn to be professionally in the same level as the other fortune 500 companies."
"Treat the candidate as a respected prospective colleague, not just a potential litigant that is probably not going to be selected for a role. The lack of directed feedback creates an environment where candidates have to guess what roles might be considered a good fit and the delayed response makes candidates submit for numerous roles at the same time. As an example of best practices, two of your competitors have contacted me directly and given me clear direction as to what roles to consider (director and above, managed markets, training, sales & marketing), making the process much more efficient for both parties."
Treat qualified candidates with dignity and respect by providing a fair interview process especially at senior level positions.
Treat people with respect 
Treat people like we mean something.
"Treat people like people, not just communicate via e-mail."
"Treat me as a person NOT a number.

You're hiring humans that when hired are supposed to be positive about the company they work for as well as the work they are doing."
Treat individuals like they are human instead of a number.   You never know the true talent of an individual unless you speak to them in person.   Instead all you do is look at a piece of paper.   Very lack luster on J&J's part.
Treat candidates with respect and provide better feedback. It has been a long time since I've applied for multiple positions at J&J and I feel totally disrespected. Former employees should receive more consideration and feedback than what has been provided.  I enjoyed my time there. 
Treat applicants like actual people and communicate.
Transparency.
Transparency when it comes to communication
Transparency throughout the vetting process and improving communication with applicants.
Transparency in recruitment. Increasing equal opportunity employment globally.
"Transparency in recruitment process. Let candidate know why they are not good fit, how can they build career in J&J."
Transparency and timing.  For this role it was months before I heard anything
Transparency and less reliance on internal / external generalist recruiters. 
Transparency 
Took months to respond. Applied about six months ago.
Took a really long time to hear a response and then there are no specifics listed as why candidate isn't qualified. Very impersonal process - 
"Too much online requirements. 
Online form can be more streamlined "
"Too many questions to answer with so little time on our hands, this should be cut short/Or the rest of the information should be taken from the recruiter or the resume. 

Also the time it takes to get an answer back from J&J is long, it is hard for a person like myself to sit around waiting for something awesome to happen."
Too long of a delay between each step of the process. Automated rejection email was sent almost four months after the application was submitted. 
"To Whom it May Concern:
I recently applied for an associate position within Ethicon. I have previously worked for Vistakon for 7 years.

"To Whom it May Concern:

I was extremely interested in the Johnson & Johnson organization and invested quite a bit of time in applying for a leadership role. When called for an interview I was excited at the opportunity to possible add value as I have quite a bit of experience in development of Shared Services Centers.  While I believe the interview went well; I never got a call back as a result of the interview until I personally found a way to get in touch with one of the managers that interviewed me.  During that call he indicated that he was unable to give me input because that would be in scope of responsibilities for the HR Dept. While I fully understood the response; I was on hold once again and unsure as it relates to the interest of Johnson & Johnson in my skills.

I realize that the new center in the Tampa area is in the developmental stages but I must say, its important that candidates receive efficient and effective input on the results of interviews/interest because much is invested mentally and emotionally when one decides to embrace the possibility of having a career with an organization.

Ultimately, I got a call from a member of the HR Team who told me that I was not selected with no specifics as to why with the exception of the fact that another candidate was selected.  I concluded that my experience must not have been in the realm of what Johnson & Johnson was looking to develop and thus extracted the positive and chalked it up as ""another learning opportunity"".

Thank you for requesting my input and I wish you the best in the development of a work class center of excellence.

"To whom it may concern,
To begin, I completely understand that Janssen/Johnson & Johnson likely receives an extremely high volume of candidates/resumes for every position posted and it could probably fill several full time positions just to send rejections. That said, as a referral from an employee of ~2 years and a promotion within that time, I was a little disappointed that I did not even receive a phone interview.  If I was unqualified, my hope as a referral would be to get a notification so that I may work to add the skills/experience necessary to be considered in the future.  A notification that the position has been filled would also be helpful.  Lastly, some additional clarity around the information shared on the ""My Jobpage"" could be beneficial as well. Perhaps a legend of the possible statuses a job will go through.  Does Inactive (no longer accepting job submissions) mean the job has been filled or simply that enough candidates have been identified?  I assume the former, but I know I was truly excited about the possibility of this position especially at a company like Janssen, only to be left wondering for more than a month. 
I hope this feedback is helpful and I look forward to hopefully hearing back regarding the two additional applications I currently have submitted. 
Best Regards,

"To whom it may concern,
First, to be transparent about the rating, I was not contacted by phone or e-mail to interview for the position, and for this specific position, I was not screened. To be clear, for this position, I was not contacted by a recruiter in any way. And, therefore, I responded very negatively to the questions because it appears I should have been interviewed. 
Over the last 10 years, I believe that my skills and experience should have enabled me to interview for positions within business development or alliance management, however, as I applied to many positions in that time, I have never been contacted by a recruiter beyond a phone screen. And then, if there was a phone screen, feedback had never been provided.

I encourage your recruiters to contact candidates by phone AND via email or text, and to get to know potential candidates better.

"To Whom It May Concern (Hopefully the head of recruiting)
You send an email asking for feedback on the interview/recruiting process to a highly qualified prospective candidate whom you never even had a phone interview with? Its apparent your process is disconnected. I wonder how many other highly qualified candidates are being overlooked......"
"To treat applicant's respectfully , really look at the CV and give a solid reason for not being a match...."
to send email about the dis-match points and show the core requirements to candidates.
To send an update at each recruitment process stage.
"To send a respond about the different application people has sent resumen, to know if we can be a candidate.
Especially when the person is applying to a different country that has residence."
To read the CVs. 
To provide reasons that the candidate does not fit to the job (just key points)
to provide more information regarding expected timing for the position filling; feedback regardless the interview result would also be useful
To provide more info on what is going on the whole process of reviewing for the position. 
To provide feedback
"To provide a reason why I was not a good fit for the position I applied to.
To be able to track online any update for the position I applied to."
To provide a formal and proper feedback on fitment / decision of not making it thru.
"To open the recruitment offer to recent graduates candidates which had not participate in any internship with j&j. Because, as a recent graduate myself, It is been very difficult to have the ""necessary experience"" beforehand to qualify to the open positions when available. This is a circle that won't let me find an entry-level job in engineering within j&j.
Thanks"
To notify me would of be good. 
"To my knowledge, I did receive an invitation to interview of this position though I applied online a number of months ago. In addition, I perform a number of the GPO negotiating duties necessary for his role in my current position for another global medical device company. Thank you for capturing my feedback via this survey. I trust it will be helpful to your future recruiting efforts."
"To much cancellations in job position. I applied 3 different positions in different period of 2016 , be in the finals & at the end all jobs was cancelled."
To make the process more personal.
To make sure that you get in touch with the potential applicant.
"To make sure it is not an administrative process to check the box since it challenges the validity of the process. In my case, I got the back up of 2 VPs to go for slating and to be fair there was a strong fit between the role and my experience. I was never called to interviews and after I wrote to the recruiter I got as feedback that they moved pretty fast in the hiring process and a candidate was selected. It would have been fine to not get the job if after interviews there was proper feedback about my lack of fit or need for improvement in specific areas but what I received was far from that. My conclusion was that the posting was made for administrative reasons and this just undermines the overall recuritment process, unfortunately."
To let us know why we were not considered.
To inform applicants on the status of their application. 
"To improve the recruitment process, You can try to put the job placement in a clearer way and then provide a feed-back of the reasons for not being called for an interview"
"To improve the recruitment process, Johnson and Johnson can continue taking surveys from potential candidates to ensure all candidates take the application process with a high regard. "
"To improve the recruitment process you could actually call me for the position and hire me! Then, you'd not have to be recruiting all of the time, as you would have a key driver and motivator in place."
"To improve the recruitment process at Johnson & Johnson, the first step would be to higher me and offer me a job! From there, the rest is easy!"
"To improve the process, I recruiter should actually call the prospective candidate for an initial phone interview. I am asked to complete this survey but no recruiter has ever called me to discuss a position I have applied for."
To hire me
"To hire a qualified person, a hiring manager should be qualified too. My impression is that hiring managers at your company do not have any idea about the job duties associated with a position they are supposed to fill."
To have more communication with the person of what the person need to obtain the position want it
To have a recruiter contact me and inform me of tne outcome of my application.
"To have a better application process, as well as follow up service. The whole recruitment process was very long, and unhelpful."
To give us personal feedback (phone call is more than enough for that) regarding ours application refusals.
To give some feedback on the status of the job application is pivotal. You are dealing with a person with emotions and real needs for a job. I understand there is a high volume so a feedback will not be possible. But an update shouldn't be so hard. 
To give feedback as to why the candidate was not suitable for the position.
To give everyone an opportunity even if the person doesn't have any experience 
To give a formal feedback about the recruitment process.
"To give a feedback to the candidate would be a good practice... start with this and, certainly, you will acquire the respect from any other candidate."
To give a detailed feedback for the candidates. Reasons why the candidate did not qualify for the position and which improvements he needs in his qualifications.
"To give a constant update to the person who JNJ interviewed.

Invite candidate for a face to face interview to get a better idea about his/her skill set and background.

JNJ also can check technical skills in face to face interview."
To get in contact with me with the feedback
to get better support and follow up from recruitment team. I am former employee.
To explain or give the opportunity for an interview. Is very sad that someone with more than 12 years of Administrative Assistant experience didn't fit the position.
"To date, I have not received feedback regarding my application. Providing some type of feedback would be ideal. "
"To contact, discuss and understand the candidate then deside to intake or reject"
To contact potential employees by email
To contact me in case of possible position in  line with my profile
"To consider applicants for other job opportunities they may present good candidacy. I would love to work for J&J if given the opportunity and although I was not a suitable match for the position I applied for, I would like to receive notifications for other job opportunities that match my experience. "
To communicate the reason for no match to solicited position.
"To clarify, the process was not bad, but my last interview was terrible.  She was very condescending, uninterested, and seemed to get upset over ""feedback"" that I received over a decade ago when I was at J & J.  On top of that, when I asked for feedback regarding the interview, I was told that none could be provided.  The hiring manager wanted ME, so did the district members.  This lady for whatever reasons seems to really enjoy the power that comes with her Eastern Region Business Director's title.  23 years in the medical sales industry, and I have never been so embarrassed and humiliated by someone's complete lack of professionalism.  Good luck in the future, J & J is a great company that I wanted to come back to in oncology, but that woman made sure that I would not get the chance."
To call the candidate !!
To break the glass enclosure and reach out to people!!
to better justify an unsuccessful application
To be more involved in the process itself 
To be more interactive with candidates
"To be more inclusive and less discriminatory in its hiring process, as well as appreciating experience."
"To be honest, I wasn't hugely impressed with KF Futurestep, who handled the original two interviews and arranged the follow-up interview with Chris Hastie (which wasn't dynamically/tightly organized).  One KFF recruiter didn't seem to know what the other had done, and the second KFF interview appeared redundant.  Neither added huge value from a candidate perspective in terms of culture, mission, key drivers, etc. "
"To be honest, based on my experience applying for jobs in US J&J facilities, I have pretty much given hope to join J&J again. "
To be honest I am not sure if the process works. I used to be an ex employee of JNJ and recently I found some jobs that fit my profile aND experience. However I strongly believe that the current hiring process is not fair and not realistic. For eg I am taking the survey with the assumption that the recruiter actually called me and did an interview that would have decided me as an candidate. None of this happened.  So I am not sure what the virtue of this survey is. To justify my reason..I could similar survey email for other positions that I had applied and never was contacted by the recruiting manager
"To be clear on my responses, I was never contacted by a recruiter, after several months I received an email stating that they went with a candidate who was a better fit for the role. 

I appreciate the opportunity to share my feedback "
"To be a final round candidate and only receive a computer generated email vs the consideration of a phone call or a response to a call placed to the hiring manger has caused me to reconsider my original perception of a company that I had a very positive impression of. Unfortunate. Though I still believe in the mission of the company and would consider employment there, this experience would cause me to think twice before accepting."
"To be 100% honest, I felt like the application process was fine (a few glitches here and there with the logging into the system but not enough to drive me away) however the silence from lack of feedback was deafening. To my knowledge, there is/was no system in place to monitor what stage of the process my application was currently in (after submission; was it reviewed or was it still sitting unread somewhere?). This was a STARK contrast to my previous experience where it was a group of candidates doing an ""interview day"" of sorts and I had a decision that very afternoon. My 7 above in the ""how likely to recommend J&J as a prospective employer to family and friends"" is down from a 10 because of this experience. I still strongly believe in the credo and what the company is trying to do, however, I cannot lie and say this experience hasn't impacted me. I'm at 917-881-7578 or gregory.eisenhart@gmail.com should anyone want to discuss this further...ultimately, I want to see J&J succeed (even though I do not foresee myself personally pursuing a career with J&J any longer)."
To ask a person who J & J recently declined to hire to fill out a survey in which J & J can improve itself is almost laughable. 
to advertise it's vacancies in more web sites and  real response for candidates 
Timely updates to candidates 
"Timely updates on the hiring process, if any. I've been waiting to hear updates on whether or not I'm a likely candidate for hiring. I can understand human is often a difficult and timely process but I have not heard any new on my status since I've applied. I have never been contacted by a recruiter both I have had both my parents been employed by Johnson & Johnson. Their satisfaction with working with such a great employer has influence my decisions to seek employment with this company."
Timely updates on current openings.
Timely updates and feedback would be appreciated.  
Timely update to the position would have been great.
"timely turn down notices, if not interested in talent , let them know as soon as possible. I know that the ATS is doing the first screen, so no real person is viewing any resumes."
Timely review of candidates to ensure they do not pass up other opportunities waiting on J&J.
"Timely responses and roles that are posted actually moving forward to fruition. I have worked closely with a couple of directors at Janssen who have tried to recruit me in on identifying roles, and many of those roles end up being canceled. As much as I have enjoyed working with Janssen over the past couple of years as a part of a partnership model, my opinion of working for the organization has significantly diminished with the formal recruitment process. This is probably the last role I will post for, and this is even with the internal sponsors I have sending me additional roles to post for. Very disappointing experience."
Timely response would help 
Timely response to application rejection.
Timely response I received a call back 2 months after phone interview I had already received another offer.   
Timely response from the recruiter or possible feedback for rejection.
Timely ongoing communications and not form letter responses

timely feedback.  
Timely feedback. 
"Timely feedback. 
Update job postings in a timely manner: remove filled positions from job board. "
Timely feedback would be helpful
Timely feedback on why my resume was rejected when I clearly meet the qualifications for the position.  It seems as though a computer scanned for certain phrases and if they were not included on the CV an automated response gets sent.
Timely feedback as to whether or not candidates are no longer being considered for the applied opportunity.
"Timely feedback and some details for the reason one is ""not a good fit"" would be appreciated.  As a contractor that has had the opportunity of working for several J&J companies, both pharmaceutical and medical device, it is difficult to understand how one can be seen as a valuable and effective contractor in the services provided, but not a good fit as a permanent employee. Thank you!"
"Timely feedback / update on recruitment process status

Timely feedback
Timely fashion and personable update
Timely emails regarding the position. I understand that I'm not right for every job but communication is common courtesy. 
Timely communication would be nice. I feel like talking to a void.
Timely communication to candidates not considered.
"Timely communication on next steps of the process whether a candidate is progressing to the next stage, or if they are no longer being considered."
"Timely communication after each stage, especially at the later/end stages.  Even if the process is taking longer than anticipated, just a quick email or phone call to update the associate/applicant on status is critical to maintaining engagement and value."
timely communication
Timely and respectful updates on the interview process. I would appreciate knowing where my candidacy is at and communication is key to this.
Timely and informative replies.
Timely and clear/concise feedback on why the candidate was not selected for the position.
Timeliness.  3+ months for a nondescript reply re we are moving forward with someone else is not all that professional. 
Timeliness to notify candidates
"Timeliness in all facets of the recruiting and hiring process is essential for candidate credibility in your organization

Time and time again it appears that your external recruitment process is really not that at all. It seems that most rolls posted are actually filled by internal applicants. Why continue posting rules if you are filling them with internal candidates. It's frustrating and creates a poor image to the External community. 
"Throughout my career, I have been privy to participate in recruiting talent for companies that I've worked for and being recruited by other companies.  J&J's fully automated process does not allow a candidate to get a positive experience with the company.  In the absence of having a networked connection, there is no level of confidence that the company will align skills with talent that is external to the company.  This is particularly concerning considering most candidates will never make it through the automated filters.  As candidates want to learn more about J&J, the lack of personal connectivity through this process is an indication on of how the internal company culture may be and it is not a good way to attract top talent.  Externally, J&J is not viewed as an employer of choice based on the lack of engagement during the recruiting process.  

J&J should retool the recruitment process to have formal human touch points with candidates as they are moving through the hiring process.  The hiring process should be clearly defined and articulated, expectations and time frames.  Candidates should receive tangible and actionable feedback on their candidacy.  Also, J&J should consider benchmarking ""employer's of choice"" to get ideas on how to make the process as transparent and authentic as possible."
Through more detailed feedback 
"Though I respect the recruiting process, it would be helpful if the recruiting team could let you know if they feel your skills might be a fit for another opening.  

I also know that some organizations have  rules surrounding a time lag for reconsidering candidates for positions after being denied.  Unless such rules are published, a candidate could continue to apply for other positions, not knowing their names is frozen in the system.

  "
This was yet another application that went into the black void. No follow-up of any kind. 
This was the most unprofessional interview that I have taken throughout my career. The HR contact provided no feedback. The panel that I interviewed never provided their business cards or contact information. I had no ability to send a follow up email. In all honesty this was a debockle.  I know I could have delivered premier results in this position. 
"This was probably a bad example for a survey. The position was put on hold and I have not received any updates. Based on the survey and the question - ""Did the recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to?"" I am only guessing the position was closed? Again, the communication for this one has been extremely poor and my opinion of the process is therefore not favorable.  "
This was my first and only contact that I was not in consideration for this position. 
"This was an extremely disappointing event for me.  I am highly upset that I was not granted an interview for the position. I read the organizational announcement for the person who was selected for the position.  They had a Biology degree, as I do.  They had a MS degree as I do.  They were a teacher, as I was as well.  They were the microbiology SME for plant steam, and I am an SME for the sterilizer.  I am not upset that the other individual got the job, I am upset that I was not given a chance to interview.  Especially since my resume and past experience is so similar to the successful candidate.  I truly believe I was not even looked at because I work nights, and I am a technician.  They dont let us leave our positions."
"This was a poor candidate experience with its sole redeeming factor that J&J had the kindness of forward a rejection notice.

Human interaction was absent, the process did not inform me of the stage of my candidacy review, and virtually no assignable reason was given for my rejection.

The talent acquisition process at J&J does not speak well for the organization."
"This was a poor candidate experience with its sole redeeming factor that J&J had the kindness of forward a rejection notice, albeit quite some time after my application.

Human interaction was absent, the process did not inform me of the stage of my candidacy review, and virtually no assignable reason was given for my rejection.

The talent acquisition process at J&J does not speak well for your family of companies."
"This was a perfect position for me, unfortunately no one contacted me.  I do not this online applicationt get a job.  I think all online applications never get looked by teh hiring manager.  Because someone in HR or lower level emploee makes a decision that candidate is not suitable and a lot good candidates are not even consided for the position.
I am currently Vice Presidenty of Global Quality and Regulatory for a medium size company.
Thanks

This the best place to work for me
This survey was the only indication I did not qualify for the position so that's wrong.  Seems as though the process is flawed and you do need to know someone on the inside.  
"This survey was meant for someone who had an interview, but I was never called for one. "
This survey was a little tough to respond to since I was not contacted by a recruiter. Would have been nice to be able to choose 'not applicable'. 
"This survey should not be counted in the overall review. I have only just applied online to this position. I did get email confirmation after submitting my application.
"
"This survey seems to operate on the premise that I have been contacted regarding the position for which I applied and was not hired. I have not received an email or any type of contact regarding the position except for the initial application confirmation of receipt email and two different surveys, one of which is this one. Perhaps there should be a better system in place to ensure that there was actually contact regarding the applicant's application. I have not received any contact regarding either advancement in the application process or a rejection notice for the position."
This survey seemed to be the mechanism for finding out I was not a candidate. This is the first I am hearing about it.
This survey isn't an accurate account of your process.  the position I was applying for was not filled.  There was a decision to expand the roll of the current manager for this position.  I did not have an opportunity to interview for this position. 
This survey is the first response I have received.  I would say fix your communication and data problems.  Integrate systems so you have accurate data.
"This survey is the first definitive knowledge that I am no longer a candidate. It would be helpful to have feedback related to why I was not selected to move forward, as I have current clinical experience in the required specialty, live so close to the field area that my travel and that of anyone in NY would be comparable, and meet the education requirements. Such information would be valuable for potential candidates. Thank you for the opportunity to comment!"
This survey is the first correspondence I received from J&J.  Some type of correspondence should be sent about position applied for before receiving a survey about the experience.  
This survey is how I discovered I did not get the job. Thanks a lot
This survey is given even though I am not aware of the statue of my application. In the past I assume that I did not get the job when this survey arrives. It would also be helpful to indicate this in the e-mail that the survey is sent in.  Cheers!
"This survey is asking me if a recruiter has contacted me with a reason why I am not a good fit for the job applied for. I have not yet heard I was not a good fit. I have heard nothing except requests to fill out surveys.

Thank you
Stacy"
"This survey invitation came before getting any feedback from my application to the Sales Manager, Depuy (3406170301) position. I think that some time should be allowed to get feedback from the recruitment team before emailing the survey invitation in order to get more accurate and detailed information about how to improve the recruitment process."
"This survey implied that I was contacted by phone, phone screened and interviewed.  I never received any invitations to participate in interviews for the 2 positions I applied for.  I only received email notifications many weeks/ a couple of months after I applied saying that the position had been filled and I had not been selected for the interview process.  So I am a bit confused by the survey that was sent to me.  Just reinforces that the company seems overly reliant on the system.  Surprised me that this was the approach for these more Senior positions.
"
"This survey has me confused.  I applied for a position, never received any feedback - good or bad - yet I received this survey on your recruitment process and how it influenced me.  I really wasn't sure how to answer your questions.  All I know is I worked at Ortho Pharm in Springhouse years ago and loved both my Admin position and my position on the line and would love to join your team again. And now I can bring a whole lot more experience to the table.  Hope to hear from your HR office soon."
This request for a survey is the only outreach / correspondence I've received for this job application. Did not hear that I was not an ideal candidate. Closing the loop either way would be appreciated. thanks!
This recruiter provided me more updates when I contacted her than other recruiters for other roles I submitted to. She was pretty responsive and did finally tell me that someone had been offered and accepted the job. The other jobs I submitted for did not even interface with me much and I had no clue where in the process I even stood. I was left to assume that I was not being considered - which is a little frustrating.
This process comes across as very mechanical. There is no human interaction. 
"This process as most is very task oriented not nececessarily people oriented.  I understand that there are many factors that make this the rule more than the exception.  The sheer volume of applicants is a challenge; therefore, folowupwith the non selected ones is not going to happen.   As and applicant and one who is people oriented and customer centric it is hard to take at times.  The unknown and no response when you're invoked in the job search is excruciatingly deflating.  In this particular instance, if I was selected; I was never contacted.  My application went into the vortex and was never heard from again until I got the infamous ""Thank you for your interest...letter after several months, kind of doubly painful.  Thank. You for the opportunity to give feedback about this process. "
This posting was at my plant. I was not contacted by the recruiter at all. I was given consideration for the job. 
"This position was posted for a J&J company speculated to be up for sale. I went on site for the interview to see the process through, but the hiring manager left before meeting me - I only met with other members of the team. I did not receive feedback or a request to complete the interview with the hiring manager. I reached out to the recruiter a few weeks later, and was told that the position status was uncertain. Never heard back after that point. I certainly understand that hiring needs change, but this was not communicated clearly to me as a candidate. If a posting is available, it should be certain enough for interviewers to take seriously. "
"This position was open for 6 months and eventually awarded to someone who did not apply for the role.  Absolutely terrible process in comparison to any other applications I have had with the company.  It was completely in conflict with all credo based, fair hiring practices.  Thankfully I have been with J&J for enough years to know that this is not the norm."
"This position was for a single individual, but two people were hired. The second person should have beed required to go back through the hiring process as there was concerns of favoritism. "
This position was closed and no interview process occurred.
This position has been taken down twice with no feed back as to why. 
"This must be computer generated because I answered a similar survey previously. J&J like other large companies recruitment process is broken; more exclusionary not inclusionary. I have over 17 years of global healthcare sales & marketing experience with an MBA and other management certifications. By my calculation, I have submitted to various positions with J&J well over 100 times in the last 10 years. Other than, ""we received your resume"", I have never received a single phone call or interview from a recruiter or hiring manager. And now, through your computer generated data base, asking ME what J&J can do to improve? If you were serious about changing, the first action you could do is be human...call and ask for a meeting...but that's not J&J."
This must be a joke since the first I have heard from J&J regarding my application is this survey. 
This job posting was canceled and as such I received a corresponding notification. No recruiter contacted me. Suggest to configure survey so that it does not include candidates that face a position that is canceled prior to the interview process.
This is to early to be sending me a survey since I just applied for the position and have not had any contact with a recruiter.
This is the third time I've received this survey and I have never been contacted by a recruiter or hiring manner from J&J. I'm not sure the survey is providing you useful information.
This is the third survey I have taken for this position. I was treated poorly during process and got an email saying I didn't get it from hiring manager. When I asked for feedback I never heard from her again. They made me jump thru hoops for the interviews too. I have also applied for another position and NEVER heard from anyone. 
"This is the second time this has been sent to me and I have not even spoke to one person. I was recommended by your employee, yet you don't even give a courtesy email stating I wasn't a good fit. I don't know what to think. Both time the process has not been favorably from the recruiting perspective. "
"This is the second time that I have received this email, requesting I participate in the survey. The funny thing is that I was never contacted by a recruiter or anyone, even to advise that they had moved on with other candidates. With this in mind, you requesting I complete your survey once, let alone sending me two requests is a bit aggressive. I ignored the first one and only completed this one because I assume if I do not send it, you will keep emailing it to me."
this is the second time i'v been asked to complete a survey without any status notification on my submission.  will not provide this again
"This is the second job I applied for that I received this survey for. In both jobs, I was never contacted regarding the job until this survey. I think there is something broken in your recruiting process. "
This is the only email I've received about the jobs that I've applied to. No one has reached out to me telling me why I am unfit for the positions applied for.
"This is the first that I have heard that I was not selected to move forward in the process.  My background is an excellent fit for the role and should at least warrant a phone screen.  Given that my career was negatively impacted by the acquisition of Synthes by J&J, one might think that my application could be viewed through an empathetic lens. "
"This is the first response I Have received for this posting, I'd say. Are the process more human if possible "
"This is the first response I got from my application.  I am a highly qualified and experienced health care executive.  It seems that your ""software"" would look for other talent to add to the pool
Bill Creech "
"This is the first message I received from J&J saying that I was ""not a good fit for the position""  I assumed I was still in the running, knowing that there wasn't any hiring in 4Q2016.  You may want to notify candidates that they are not being considered before sending a survey stating so."
This is the first I have heard from anybody at Johnson & Johnson concerning the position.   I wish somebody would have email me and tell me the status of my application.
This is the first I am hearing anything aside from a rejection email received -MANY months after applying. Disappointing in the manner it was handled. 
This is the first email or contact saying that I was passed over.  It would be nice to find out first and would be most helpful to get feedback on why or what could have been better.
This is the first communication I've had about this position. If someone tried to call I am currently out of the country and they didn't follow up via email which is the preferred method of contact. Maybe instead of sending surveys make sure that one has actually been contacted prior to being asked for an opinion. 
This is my second time I have submitted this kind of survey. I have given my recommendations in the past
"This is my 2nd time through the J&J candidate process in the past 3 years.  Neither experience was positive and not just because I did not receive an offer.  There is no visibility into the status or timing of my submission.  Absolutely no follow up by the recruiter in each instance.  I am left with a much more negative perception of the organization than when I began the process, which is concerning for such a public consumer based organization"
This is interesting that I have received this survey as I never received any follow-up to the submission of my resume.
"This is crucial for a recruiting process that’s looking for candidates with technical skills, or a strong background or experience. Sadly, people like and stretch things on their resumes, creating difficulty to the process and to the company after the initial hire. Don’t be afraid to ask a copywriting candidate to write a press release, or a programming candidate to write a short code, or a sales candidate to do a mock sales call. Especially if the test is on the spot, it’ll make it clear who can work under a tight deadline and who actually stands up to what the resume says."
This is an odd survey - I was not screened or called for interviews for this job.  I was never informed of any information after I posted for it.
"This is an interesting impersonal survey. However, it is highly inapplicable. My only communication with J&J Talent Acquisition was through standard generic mass produced emails.
Yes. I may be a disgruntled job seeker, but J&J is very nearly just like the lot of companies that are apparently too overwhelmed to share some semblance of personalization. Yet not too busy to cull information from the discarded pile. Go big data!"
This is a stupid survey where no one and I repeat no one called or emailed me about an interview ect. This is a joke really?
This has been the only contact I have had with Johnson and Johnson. 
"This has been a typical story for companies large and small.  Big talk about valuing process and people yet too busy to actually do so.  In an age where automation has made recruiting so much easier, it has taken companies back to the stone ages in terms of actually building a bridge to perspective applicants and caring, at least a bit.  Years ago, with stacks of paper, HR teams called people and/or actually sent mail, post cards, letters.

Speaks of class and doing things the right way.  For all the ""automated"" application buttons, a truly disappointing lack of professionalism and process...Leaders who serve?  Think not!"
This experience was so highly impersonal and one I would never recommend to a perspective job candidate.  You can and should do better.
"This contact was by an online recruiter. I have not spoken with anyone. I am a former Johnson and Johnson employee and know your system well. It is not the best but, pretty good. 
I believe it is best to always speak to someone. 
"
"This company is only collecting the resumes to increase their data base. They never call for an interview,I am applying for many years but I never got an interview call.Its a standard answer ,we can not move forward with your ,,,,
Please stop this and start hiring. Why are you hiring through agency as a temp and no perm job?"

"This company has a well know reputation, with that being said J&J shouldn't segregate applicants based on College preference. Meaning J&J only hire from top tier/ well know schools. Talent comes from all walks of life and educational brackground. Never know if your passsing by the next Warren Buffett!"
"they would improve alot if they give people an opportunity to work for them, just like myself. i Would prove that i am dedicated to work at any position if i were ever given a chance. "
They were not even evaluating the resume before sending the response. I was the best fit for couple of positions but contacted only once and then said will get back to me. no response after that.
They took very long to let me know that I didn't have the job and could not even give me a reason why I was not qualified. I was never contacted by a recruiter just received an email weeks later after I  applied for the job. 
they should make the recruitment process more fast and clear.
They should inform to candidate why they are not selected or when they can join as earlier as they can
They should give chance to freshers also to express their talent and learn from the company because if fresher will not get any chance they will never become experienced.
They should do a skype interview or atleast interview on phone since a CV does not tell everything about the candidate. There might be freshers who would be better and just waiting for opportunities.
They should contact the prospective to let them know the selective procedures status.
they should contact the applicant and just let them know they weren't chosen.  Its very frustrating to not get any response
They should call and speak to applicants.
They should call and give a chance to prove ourselves. 
They should at least interview the people who applied.this is probably the 10 time that I applied.
They received my application when they'd already offered the position to a candidate. They should remove the posting once they have interviews in the process or if offers have gone out. They kindly explained the situation and there were no further discussions. I remain interested in further roles.
they never spoke to me at all 
They never get back to you. Not even with with the reject letter. Instead they send you multiple survey emails. Which is of no use! When a candidate spends like 20 min of their time have the courtesy to atleast get back with a reject if you no longer want to continue with the application. Rather than sending multiple survey emails and pissing off the candidates. 
They never gave me an opportunity as to why I was not a good candidate for their procurement team.
They never contacted me! Wasted a lot of time applying!!!
They never contacted me one way or the other.  
"They never call OR discuss the job requirements and candidates qualification. Also, it looks like this company is never interested in hiring experienced  candidates.Most of the time when my qualifications met they have a standard reply,"" Due to changing business needs,this position is not required"""

They need to revise their scoring techniques for selecting interview candidates.
"They need to notify the person and let them know how's the process is going for them. I wasn't told anything about the application I completed, only told to complete a survey."
They need to give opportunity of Interview
They need to follow up.
"They need to be more transparent regarding open opportunity.  If they are consider a internal candidate, then it should be known.   They need a more effective way to follow-up with potential candidates.   In addition, upfront candidate selection should be based on knowledge and experience...not just compensation."
They have never contacted me.
"They have never contacted me after my application. 
Interview never happened.
Wondering what kind bad practice is this with such professional company."
They don't value high skill
They did not offer me the position. 
"They could provide more information during the recruitment process, but I know they get a large number of applicants which would make this very difficult.
As a minimum, it would be nice to know if you are being considered or not being considered for the position applied for so that other opportunities can considered.

Gary Peters"
"They could prefer for telephonic interview or face to face through Skype, then take decision or required action on employment."
They could call me in for an interview and hire me. 
They could bring me on board so as to improve the efficiency of the dept and organization.  Stating I am not qualified only means that my credentals and my experience moreover were overlooked during this review process. 
They could actually test people to see how well they would perform in the position. This is better than mediocre managers screening out candidates that could be threatening to their job security in the future.
They could actually contact me regarding this position. No one has called or emailed me about interviewing for this job.  
They can send more timely updates. I had my 3rd interview in November and in December I heard through friends that the position was combined with another territory and therefore would not be filled. I didn't receive communication from JNJ of the position being cancelled until March 1st.  
They can just look at resumes and call multiple people that have interest in a particular occupation.
They can improve by sending news letters
They can get back in touch with those whom have applied for positions within the organization.  I never heard anything after I applied.  This resulted in me obtaining work elsewhere.
They can do so by having a better judgment of the qualifications of the candidate and how do they fit the posted position not simply make their decision based on how proficient a person in writing a resume or  a cover letter.
They can contact applicants once their resume has been reviewed. 
"They can begin by treating all candidates with respect.  I'd suggest treating candidates who were former J&J employees (10+ years) with maybe even a bit for respect.  I received NO feedback from the recruiter at all. The hiring manager was sent 4 recommendations from current J&J employees, so at the VP level and didn't even reply or get back to them.  These employees were sent a strong message that the position was filled before it was ever posted. The new hire who filled the role is a qualified individual (I know them personally) - especially since I trained them... so what it comes down to is you have leadership who is too afraid to hire candidates that might be uncomfortable for them to manage, because they're in a role that is over their head.  
Used to love J&J.. would tell anyone who would listen how great a company it is, about the CREDO, the people, the mission... not any more.  "
They can be better about contacting the appliers even if they did not receive the job. 
They can address why were not fit for the position . 
They can actually look at my application materials. I actually know an individual who was interviewed for the position and she has the same background as me (identical resume). 
"They can actually contact the individual within 48 hours of a submission to let the person know if they are being considered for a position or not. I personally, have had no contact whatsoever with Johnson and Johnson after I submitted an application weeks ago."
They can actually contact the applicants.  I received a rejection email within 2 hours of applying.  I've been in pharma for 8 years.  I was not even considered for a call. 
They can actually contact qualified applicants.
They can actually contact me for this role if they would like me to provide feedback on the process.  :)
They are doing great but I would like option to apply face to face as well. 
"They are doing a fantastic job. However, more scientists involvement would be ideal. Innovation drives the future, and sometimes only scientists can understand real potential. J&J is an ideal company with great historical leadership, and the world is moving fast so they need to ensure they are moving at the same rate."
They are a great company to work for; I have worked there as a contractor for 3 years. It is NOT easy to become an employee. There is NO feedback about ways to improve your chances or constructive criticism. Over half the jobs I've applied for I never hear anything about. Half that I have interviewed for I never hear if I got the job or not (I imagine NOT). It's like the recruiting department has conflict issues. 
These surveys do not sync up to recruiting activities.
"These days recruitment is very fast. Similarly roles and offers offered to candidates are highly competitive. Though I am still very much interested in the position I applied for, I have not heard back anything from the recruitment team. I am an experienced candidate and other recruiters have gotten back to me with acceptance, interview schedule for roles I am fit for and feedback for the positions I am not quite suitable for. As this feedback is important for Johnson and Johnson talent acquisition team, the feedback from recruiters is also highly important and valued for the candidates like me. I would appreciate if the recruitment team could at least touch the base with experienced candidates as soon as possible and reduce their own workload. I  am a quality oriented person and I take pride in the brands I am associated with. In this digital age my experience as a customer or as a stakeholder can drive my future association or disassociation with the brands. I am sure my feedback will be taken in a positive manner and will help Johnson & Johnson talent acquisition team and entire organization to scale new heights. Thanks.   "
There's zero contact for months. What do you think?
"There's very little communication.  I apply for the job and then I never hear anything ever again, other than an automated message telling me my application has been received.  I assume if I hear nothing that I'm not a candidate, but it would be nice to get some kind of message when I'm disqualified.
"
There's no place to indicate the name of employee referral on the online application or online profile. 
"There will always be a very attractive and impressive resume or CV that you will encounter, the question is, is the person behind the resume or CV is authentic, can the resume or CV prove that he/she is worthy to join the company. Something to ponder, right!

Thank you.
 "
There were technical issues and I reached out to your technical support team and never received any support.   
"There were only two instances of communication regarding the role I applied for: 1) an automated e-mail response that my resume had been received, and 2) an e-mail many weeks after that I was not being considered for the role. My answers to this survey were based on this experience, although I had no interactions with your recruiting staff."
"There were not touches, none.  I have 20 years in technology, healthcare specifically; most recently as a hospital CIO and consulant, and liked the idea of working for such a well known company...here is the text of the email I received:
Sir or Madam: (we are asked our gender during the process)

There were no problems with the recruiting process.  I pulled myself out of consideration due to another job opportunity within J&J.
"There were extreme lag times between messages, including text messages, and replies from the recruiter.  Additionally, I believe I was interviewed over the phone twice for the same position, but I received no feedback other than the rejection notice. "
there was zero feedback 
There was zero contact. I went into a black hole between the automated application acknowledgement email and this one asking for feedback.  Disappointing.
There was very little communication from the recruiter. I would love an opportunity to join JnJ.
"There was some mix up after the completion of the entire process.  I interviewed, was offered the position, then declined.  After a few months, I recieved an email stating that they were sorry but were not going to offer me the position. It was a mix up...

Otherwise, the process was acceptable.

"
There was none!
"There was no recruitment, I applied on my own and was just sent an email saying I didn't meet what they were looking for. This was without even communicating with me to see if I actually fit the job description and ask about my qualification which do fit what the job description was asking."
there was no recruitment process. I was never contacted.
There was no recruitment process.  I applied for a position through jobs.jnj.com and never recieved any feedback other than a denial e-mail.  I'm more than qualified for the position with a very decent resume and cover letter.  Expected more out of a company like J&J.
"There was no recruitment process that I was involved in for the position in which I applied.  I applied for the position in September, received an email notification that my application was received, and then heard nothing further for several months when I was notified via email that I was not selected for the position.

Frankly, I find receiving this type of inquiry after going through the 'recruitment process' rather insulting."
"There was no process, so..."
There was no process
There was no personalized feedback regarding my application. I received a general electronically generated rejection email and that was the only feedback I got from J&J. I consider it disrespectful. 
"There was no personal touch at all.  I did not hear back for quite a while, and then all I got was a form letter email saying that I was not selected.  Fortunately, I had already been hired by another company that contacted me instantly after submitting my resume.  I was not impressed at all by the Johnson & Johnson recruitment process.  That surprised me.  My opinion of the company was much higher before this experience."
There was no interpersonal communication. My online application was sent and I received template responses for everything. Nothing feels personal about this process.
"There was no human interaction.  I applied, received an email stating thank you for applying but we are not interested in pursuing you for this position and then received two survey emails. 

There's been more interaction with surveys than the recruiting process.

Thank you"
There was no human contact.  It was just the ATS abyss.
"There was no human contact, just the standard rejection templated email."
"There was no formal recruitment process.  I was contact by hiring manager's assistant.  Recruiter should contact the potential candidate, explain company culture, and benefits etc.  "
"There was no feedback or updates along the process.  Did not realize I did not even get an opportunity to interview until after it was announced the positions were being filled.
Reason for not providing an interview opportunity was based on nearly a two year old conversation with a past supervisor. No current contact was made with me at all until after the fact."
"There was no email or phone call or any other communications after the application. Only communication that I ever received was that I was not fit for the position after several weeks. I think the biggest feedback for J&J HR team is that first find out if the candidate was every talked to by anyone and then send them a survey. You will end up with crappy data in your survey if you send this survey to all those candidates whom you never reached out in the first place. What is the point of asking how well interviewer explained everything if no one called the candidate? And you should know that no one called the candidate. If you don't know that then you have a bigger problem. 
Thanks,
Kedar"
"There was no effort made by the recruitment process to contact me, giving a reason nor a thank you email stating that I was not best fit for the role, just this survey email to fill."
There was no effort in the recruitment process! I filled out an application later was emailed something like lots of applicants we chose a different candidate.
There was no direct contact that I remember.
"There was no contact, no decisioning.  Having applied to numerous positions which my background was a strong fit, with no contact from recruitment, it appears to me these postings are not truly available, but rather candidates are already preselected prior to posting. "
There was no contact with a recruiter at all to discuss my qualifications. 
"There was no contact or feedback on my applications other than the system generated form letters.  

How can I recommend JNJ as a prospective employer based on my experience?"
There was no contact or any communication to give any insight into the process or results.
There was no contact made from the recruiter for the Johnson & Johnson position that I applied for.  
There was no contact made by the recruiter. Even in the application process if some other candidate is selected the other candidates who have applied should be notified.
There was no contact made at all about the position aside from multiple email surveys.
"There was no contact from the application time to the ""we regret to inform you"" email... Communication and status updates should be improved..."
"There was no consideration given to my application. I have been in medical sales for many years with constant sales increase.
I am conserned that my age was a factor that kept me from being considered "
There was no communication from the HR or the recruiter whatsoever and I do not know why I resume was not shortlisted.
There was no communication during the recruitment process and there was more urgency around this survey verses my application.
There was no communication at all.  Need to communicate
"There was no communication at all from anyone about my resume submission. I bring to the table specialty skills and was therefore surprised there was no response at all. If proper attention had been paid to the resume perhaps other opportunities for other positions could have been identified and perhaps placement in another position could have been possible.
Recruitment is costly for an organization and the cost elevates when skilled talent is not recognized and placed within the organization in the most cost effective method."
There was never any follow-up.  After months I was sent an email.  I never had direct contact with anyone. 
"There was lack of response time with final interview. I was assured there would be response by end of week, there wasn't. Interview process took 6 weeks and I wasn't given consideration of a phone call to explain why I wasn't chosen for position. Very unprofessional "
"There was absolutely no communication from recruiters or hiring managers for this role.  This paints a very poor picture of J&J Consumer and the OTC franchise.  As a displaced employee, I had no expectation of hiring preference, but I would have appreciated a more respectful system of communication regarding my candidacy for this role."
"There was absolutely no ""real"" contact from a recruiter, just automated responses.  This is in-line with almost all the other companies I have applied to, since there was no recruiter contact from any of them as well, but if companies want to set themselves apart from ""those"" companies, the recruiters need to make a better effort to have ""real"" communication with candidates.  And, yesterday, I noticed a LinkedIn blog where candidates were having conversations about this subject and are writing that this is now the ""new norm"" and that candidates should not expect a response...ever, so just ""get over it and move on.""

Is this the kind of candidate experience you want?  And do you want Johnson & Johnson to be clumped in with all those other ""no-response"" or ""automated response only"" companies?

As a technical recruiting professional, I pride myself in responding to all my applicants, and I especially reach out by phone to those candidates who have actually gone through the interview process, taken the time to get dressed up in their best attire to show up on time and participate in an on-site interview. 

Don't they deserve at least a personal phone call?  Is it too time consuming for a recruiter to personally let a candidate know that he or she didn't get the job and to thank them for considering their company?



"
"There was a disconnect between what I perceived as a strong screen interview and the subsequent interview scheduling. The position I applied for was cancelled following my phone screen, and then reposted a week later. It took several emails and phone calls to understand the status and I still don't know what happened with the position or why I wasn't selected to interview. I will continue to pursue opportunities at J&J regardless of this experience, but I did find the process confusing and frustrating given my excitement to join the company. "
There shouldn't be a one-time evaluation process. Johnson & Johnson should keep the resume of candidates in archives and revive it as and when suitable vacancy arises in the organization.
There should start interview face to face.
There should be much more communication.  It is very deflating to not receive any feedback or updates on the status of a position.  
"There should be fair process based on the education & experiences. I have been trying for the last 12 years to join J &J but never got invited even at once to appear for an interview. Look forward and I will keep applying as I have keen interest in joining J &J.

Thanks

There should be a way for applicants to view the current status of their applications.  This could allow for the applicant to update themselves on the status without using resources to try and make the interactions.
There seems to be a difference if one finds a position through J&J site or Janssen or others. So it would be great if they were consolidated. 
There needs to be real time updates on where you are in the process. canidates should be able to type their name in to the system and see a graphical representation of a where they are in the selection process. 
"There needs to be more feedback, and a better way to ask questions about the rolls. I reached out several times to try and get an update on the process and where it was and I never heard back. I had to reach out to people in the hiring group to understand where the process was at."
"There needs to be more clarity on expectations by both sides.

the process should not go forward if one of the sides can not meet the job requirements, compensation expectations, etc. "
"There is such a delay in reaching out to me and giving me feedback. I haven't been contacted directly or told why I was not selected. Perhaps knowing if there were job fairs for J&J would be helpful too. 

I'm a mom of twins looking to re-enter the ""paid"" working world and just need a chance to prove myself. I am willing to begin on any level in the organization to make this happen for my family.

Thank you for your time.

"There is not feedback, when have is a default answer.
Tks."
"There is no human touch to the process. Some companies take due care in timely updating candidates (or make their automated system such). Candidates spend a lot of time in applying, you should at least value their time and respect their interest in working for you. I love J&J and I strongly believe that it is a great company to work for. But for majority of touch points your ATS creates a very inhuman impression."
"there is no followup on roles.  you are lucky to get a ""sorry you were not selected"" email several weeks later with no reason"
"There is no doubt that Johnson & Johnson is one of the best pharma company. However for all the jobs I have applied till now, I have got the same response from J&J saying they have found someone who is more qualified. I sometimes doubt whether the company just hire someone internally or through internal references and overlook candidates like me who have no direct links with J&J but have qualifications and work experience. Despite meeting most of the requirements listed under the job openings, I have never got a call for the interview."
"There is no doubt J&J is a dream career for a lot people like me and they receive tons of applications for one position. I have 4.00 GPA, preparing for CPA license, completed an Tax Internship with PricewaterhouseCoopers, have other Tax experiences as well but I didn't even get a phone interview! I believe some campus recruiters have very strong feelings only for certain schools, which isn't a fair way to determine an applicant's qualities of future work. Anyway, I wish J&J best of luck. T"
"There is no contact after submission of my application.  Excepting knowing the computer received my application, I know nothing about my application, whether my cv has been reviewed ?  Have i been rejected yet ?  Nothing."
There is no communication from recruitment team.  
there is no communication from recruiters
"There is no 'human touch' in the Johnson & Johnson recruitment process.  Applicants, either successful or unsuccessful, should receive proper correspondence from the recruitment department.  Managerial-level applicants should be contacted via phone for the result, as their time is most valuable."
"There is little to no effective communicaiton between recruiter and the applicant.  The expectaion as an internal, J&J employee, is at least an acknowledgement and feedback on the application.  The process for internal positings needs greater transparency and communication."
There is always a large lead time between an interview and issuing an offer
"There is absolutely no feedback to the applicant.  I have applied to many positions in J&J and have rarely even got any response of any kind.  The process is a complete black box.  It would be nice to know that a position has been filled and why I am not the right fit for a particular job.  Applying is a very frustrating process.   It seems as though one has to rework a resume to contain the correct  buzz words for the electronic process to deem one worthy of consideration.  You may be overlooking very dedicated, qualified scientists that can contribute to the success of your corporation.   "
There is absolutely no contact with the candidate whatsoever nor any feedback in the process.
There is a long wait between application and the decision letter.  
"there is a long gap between the application and rejection, and both are generic form letters.  While I do appreciate at least the closing of the loop, it seems a long time - in this case it was 2 months with no communication in between.  As a hiring manager, I understand the volume of applicants you get, so the response is appreciated. "
There is a discrimination on the part of HR and recruitment process is only for friends and relatives. 
There has to be a concerted effort to keep potential employees more engaged with the process. The attempt to build a relationship even before the resource is part of the organization says more about the company and what the resource should expect once he / she joins the company.
There has been no response from the recruitment team except for this Survey. 
There has been no contact from J&J at all regarding the status of my application.
"There does not seem to be a ""recruitment process"". It appears that there is a robot process which is responsible for obtaining the best candidates.  The other possibility is that these jobs are floated as a result of wanting to promote internal candidates and the appearance of ""due diligence' is done."
there are talents within the company but is ignored. The recruitment process needs to value talents already within the company.
"there are so many ways, recruiter contact would be the start of improving processes "
There are so many internet applicants - I understand how difficult it is to have personal contact. Just let the ATS do what it does.
There are qualities in candidates that do not translate on paper.  A short phone interview would have been sufficient for me to sell my qualities and show why I would be a benefit.
"There are many talented professionals in the Jacksonville community that simply do not see making any effort to apply for positions with Johnson and Johnson because you never get any feedback
These same resources came fro Fortune 500 companies,are highly qualified but see Johnson and Johnson as an organization that is simply not resource friendly"
"There are a lot of talented people that will never get passed a resume. I've been selling since the age of 17 and I am looking for the opportunity to showcase selling more than jewelry.  This business has taught me that through relationship selling anything is possible. Unfortunately, a resume has to be short and sweet otherwise loses the attention of the reader unless they have previous pharmaceutical sales experience so one is never given a chance just a skim review. Some of my best salespeople are the ones that I have put myself in front of and recruited on my own.... in person. Yes, I talk to all that apply, relationships are important. Important to grow your business and your reputation. What message does it send when you get an auto reply?
Thank you so much for the follow up. Hope you find it helpful."
"There are  candidates like me. who would love to work with Johnson and Johnson.

even thought i have 18 years experience in export field when i have applied for administrative or supply chain i was not selected. 

i feel that talents can come from any field . companies should give chance to explore the talent.  which may help ful to company too. 
"
"The word ""improve"" implies a baseline performance level. Since my applications seem to have been lost in the vast J&J recruitment cyberspace, and nothing actually happened, it is impossible for me to suggest any way to ""improve"" the ""recruitment process"" . 

I got more polite treatment from my applications to other pharmaceutical companies (e.g., GSK, Takeda) than my internal applications within J&J. They even bothered to reply."
The whole process was a joke from start to finish!
"The whole process of interview took more than 3 months (Oct - Jan). The recruiter provided wrong location for first face to face interview and the hiring manager was late for interview.  Second interview was done with video, it was hard to understand the questions and the VP was luck of interested in the beginning of conversion, not sure if this because the gender issue.  "
The whole process needs restructuring.  There is not one positive in the experience.
"The whole process from start to finish was unclear. I applied with a referral from an internal employee. I was notified to complete the virtual interview before the ""job fair"". Once I submitted the virtual interview I never received a confirmation and I was unsure if I attend the event previously mentioned in email. There was no contact information on the generated email so I asked my referral to ask if my interview was received. I was told there were system issues and it was never received making me miss confirmation to attend the event. A few weeks later I received a call from the recruiter asking if I was still interested. I never received information about the position and because the lack of communication I accepted another job offer. A couple months later I received another generated email starting I was not accepted to the next round. I value the company but there needs to be better communication from recruitment. "
The website is very confusing and takes a while to understand. 
The website is difficult to search for open positions
"The website is difficult to narrow selection criteria and requires multiple redundant searches due to lost settings after reading a description. Additionally the email saying the candidate is not a good fit for the position is not specific. If multiple positions are applied for, it is not clear if the rejection is for all positions applied or just specific ones. "
The website is a bit confusing to navigate. It's difficult to go in and update your profile. 
"The website has cookies to load which are blocked by J&J computers internally through the administrator function.  So, existing J&J employees are unable to successfully access the site and utilize drop downs appropriately. 

I also have applied for roles and can not see them in the My Next Step Section due to the loading of the cookies. 

I made the site email aware of the issue and was contacted intially but without any form of follow up or solution. 

The low favorably is reflective of the website issues and lack of contact by the recruiter. "
The web site needs improvement. I was not able to complete the application process due to site issues not allowing me either upload my resume or retrieve my password at times. this continued for weeks
"the web page isn't user friendly, it times out, and/or leaves spaces where I can't see my entire entry"
The video recording of the initial interview was a painful process due to J&J system issues. I would've much rather preferred a phone screen.
The video interview does not properly show cases whether or not someone can perform the job or is a good fit for the position.
"The vibe I get about J&J is that HR is very finicky about the type of candidate they want from a candidate compared to other employers at career fairs. When I showed them my resume last year, they showed no interest even looking at it because of the ""type"" of student I was. Since then I have gained other skills that would make my work experience more valuable but I'm not sure I want to deal with their recruiting process again. "
The usual no reason to koto get the interview.
The use of conference calls as the primary means of interviewing was a little convoluted. I was not aware at first using a conference call system was going to be utilized. For my case it would have been helpful to have that notice more well defined ahead of time.
The turn around time after the interview is too long. I was not officially informed of my stand after the interview until more than two months after the interview. This length of time is too long to keep anybody waiting. 
"The time lag from application submission and final email ding was absurd...probably 6 months.

In addition, I have applied to work for J&J several times.  Throughout each experience, I apply to several jobs that are eventually cancelled.  My understanding is that they are filled from within or the job is eliminated.  Well, then, it should not be posted on the web site.  

Truly a very disappointing recruitment experience for such high quality company."

Truly a very disappointing recruitment experience for such high quality company."
"The time from application to receiving the first interview call from the recruiter was 6 months and then another month to schedule the on-site interview. Then another month went by before I heard back that I was being considered for another position because the needs of the position I had applied for had changed.

In all its very lengthy and I was unsure about my prospects. As a result, I accepted an offer at another company."
"The time between interview and informing me that I was not selected was extremely too long. I already figured I was not a match for the position when I didn't hear from anyone within a week. Once I left the interview, there was no other contact from anyone at J&J until I received the generic 'not selected' email. I do feel that should an ideal position become available, I may apply again. "
The time between applying for a position and receiving a rejection letter needs to be shorten.  I have waited months before hearing from the company.  A recruiter has never contacted me. 
"The third person I interviewed with asked for experience in areas that were not listed in the job description. The job description, therefore, seemed incomplete. I did not have all of the experience he asked about, and I knew that, but since it wasn't listed in the job description I didn't know that I was wasting my time with the previous interviews. The position that I interviewed for ended up being eliminated."
The Talent Acquisition Team needs to play a vital role towards better candidate screening process and map the experience to the role.
The system would not allow me to update my candidate profile to add a customized cover letter for additional postings.
The system sometimes feels combersome with little feedback. 
"The system should at least provide feedback on submissions - never got notification of many bids or communications around those submittals and I feel that's not Credo oriented and tells much about a company. Worked for J&J for years expectations on how company communicates are high and should be.

"The survey is written as if I was contacted and interviewed by a recruiter - this did not occur.  I am a recently displace employee (March 13) who has the upmost respect for JNJ and my management and would happily return.

I am actively applying and looking forward to returning to my JNJ family.

"The survey is nice, but its funny to not give me a good reason why I wasn't a fit for the position, and then asking if you did.

3/10 rating of J&J was based on recalls due to contamination and incorrect ingredient concentration issues."
The submission process is very efficient in capturing data and providing a good experience.  I would say the only feedback is to have the system 'clean up' on 'My Job Page' those jobs for which are either years old or left in draft and no longer taking submissions. This would make for a cleaner overview of relevant jobs I am still being considered for or have not been selected but are within a reasonable timeframe.
"The skills required for the position exactly matched with what I had been doing it for years.

If I remember correctly I applied for the position on Wednesday or Thursday and I recieved a rejection on weekend Saturday. Very strange.

I think I should have got atleast a face to face interview with the hiring manager or a telephonic interview with HR

I didn't expect this kind of recruitment process from Gaints like Johnson & Jhonson

I might be wrong but I felt it was a bit unfair to me"
The sistem is good
The search by location feature on the careers website was not very intuitive. A suggestion would be to select the state(s) and then check locations of interest within that state. 
"The rumour out there is that the jobs posted aren't really available.  From my own personal experience as a consultant, that seems to be true."
The responses back for applications are severely lacking. It should not take months to reject an application. I have also gotten referrals from friends for positions. Those you never hear back from. It is a lack of respect for people which is against your own credo. I have stopped applying for jobs at JnJ. Not worth the effort. 
"The response to the application should be considerably more than the short email I got.  I was turned down for the job; that was all that was said and no reason was given.  Considering that my good friend who works in J & J helped me and recommended me, and that I am a PhD in Pharmacology who is an RN at the same time, the HR process only functions as a cold stone wall alienating good, reliable candidates.  There isn't even no phone number to contact to follow up the application. It seems that J & J doesn't really want to hire people. Nothing in the experience gives me a reason to apply for jobs at J & J, which is bad for this company."
The response to my application for this position was quick but several other applications for other positions at J & J have gone unanswered including one where a recruiter reached out to me.
"The response time was extremely long from application date submission to rejection letter.  As a large company, I would have expected short turnaround time and feedback."
"The response time and just overall process is very slow and antiquated. There are too many steps and requires quite an investment of time for potential candidates. I was very high on J&J prior to my experience, but this completely changed my view. I now see first hand that J&J doesn't value candidates and gives the impression they do not value the process."
"The response I received from the posting I applied to was something in the neighborhood that  ""The position that you have applied to is no longer being posted"".

I was very pleased with the fact that I was notified that I was no longer a candidate. I recently posted, and interviewed, for a position with my former employer of 27 years. I had two phone and three in-person interviews and never  heard a thing thereafter. I was a former employee in very good standing, held an executive position since 1999, and went out on disability. I was excited to rejoin my former family, but unfortunately, not have the courtesy to respond back that I did not get the job left a bad taste. "
The rejection letter for the position was sent only a few days after the application was submitted which shows me that the company did not give me much consideration
"The rejection is a generic mass email. Although I understand that it's taxing to reply to each applicant, it would also be nice to know who the recruiter is. There's a lack of accessibility for applicants for followup questions or concerns. "
The recuiter should be in more contact with the candidate in terms if they are or are not selected for the interview process.  I have submitted many applications with no response and then after about 2 months I get notified that I was not selected and the position has been filled.  It would be nice to hear sooner that I did not make the first round of interviews.
The recruter should contact is in a specific SLA or Applogies through mail 
"The recruitment team could be more specific behind the rejection. Or, at the least, extend an offer for a phone interview in order to discuss any perceived deficiencies. We both lost out on opportunity. J & J lost an ethical hard worker, and I lost out on a career opportunity. "
"The recruitment staff should provide feedback on the application. If the candidate is not selected,  they should give more specific explanation."
"The recruitment process, from my experience, was a black hole.

I submitted an application on 11/4/2016, then some time later (3/20/2017) received a form letter informing me they had found more qualified candidates.  I have 16 years of experience in Consumer Insights and Market Research, yet did not even qualify for a screening call.

I can't speak to how the recruiter acted/did not act as I was never contacted by anyone.

While I have a great deal of respect for the company, as they are an industry leader, I am disappointed in what seems to be an impersonal and puzzling recruiting process.

To date, I've applied to 4 different positions at J&J, three of them within insights specifically, and have never been contacted by a recruiter."
The recruitment process would be great if it provided feedback. I am prior service in the military and expected feedback in regards of employment.
"The recruitment process was very good, the recruiter was excellent. "
The recruitment process was effective. 
The recruitment process should only send invites to candidates that highly matches the position. 
"The recruitment process should flag prior employees of J&J, especially ones that have been given 1 year inside access, and offer a little bit more engagement from recruiting. It feels very impersonal to receive only automated emails from the system when I know most of the people involved with the recruitment and hiring. 
I've seen some great examples of personal responsiveness from other large corporations, including personal emails indicating the recruitment process and approximate timeline, the consideration of candidates, etc. Much improved process!"
"The recruitment process seems to be purely robot-based.
I applied to function to which I think I am qualified, my skill and experience are relevant, and the only thing I received back is this survey to assess the application experience.
Obviously not a good one.
"
"The recruitment process seems to be biased and unorganized. Improving speed of recruitment decisions and providing feedback would definitely help the interested candidates.
"
The recruitment process seemed quite transparent.  No details were provided other than I not selected for the next stage of the candidate recruitment .
The recruitment process needs to communicate with the applicant from the beginning until the end of the process. Its like a Black hole.
"The recruitment process isn't living up to J&J's reputation and is likely effecting your ability to recruit top tier talent.  

I have not received any feedback whatsoever on the 14 applications I made over the past few months and as a result, I have little confidence in applying to a job via the J&J talent community. I've even considered deleting my profile..

I was forced to look for alternative paths for making J&J aware of my applications – this isn’t optimal for me or the J&J Executives / HR team but I have to somehow ensure I at least get a fair shake and knock down barriers to getting the job I strongly desire… 

You asked if the recruitment process influenced my score...  but more importantly, you should know how it has influenced my score (in what direction) and why. This way, you can better understand whats going on and its effects. 

So the answer is yes, recruitment process has influenced me to lower my perception and scores as it has not lived up the promise of the talent community. For example: Let talent know where they stand and send communications if no longer in consideration for the job.  

In all honesty,  the process has also negatively influenced my high opinion of J&J. I have been a part of a couple more talent communities which seem to be using the same software and J&J is the only one to that's dysfunctional... that doesn't meet the perceived standard that many outsiders have of J&J - most outsiders, including myself see J&J as being at the apex of performance. 

Hope this helps...

"The recruitment process is very poor, even compared to other corporations of its size. I can design you a better on-line recruiting tool. Your HR VP should contact me for a discussion. 914-263-2241 or jppecora@verizon.net "
The recruitment process is very lengthy and no one ever gets back to you to tell you that you were not selected and the reason
The recruitment process is horrible.  I applied for many positions only to get rejection 3 months later or sometimes longer than that. Valuable talent is being missed by the poor recruitment process. 
The recruitment process is good.
The recruitment process is extremely streamlined. This reflects the reputation and respect the company has established throughout the world. The follow up is very prompt and I thank the team for their excellent work.
"The recruitment process is extremely impersonal overall.  At the time of my job search (beginning early 2015) I was a Manager at my current job.  I applied for multiple roles within J&J and Janssen and was never contacted nor did I receive a response for most.  I am now receiving ""decline"" response emails from jobs I posted for more than 12-16 months ago.  So the response time is inadequate to say the least.

For one of the roles, I applied for (Sr. Analyst), I was treated as if I was not good enough during the interviews though it would have been a step back in my career path.  However, at the time J&J was highly desirable as a potential employer.  I completed a phone interview and was brought onsite to Janssen and interviewed.  I interviewed well, however, I never heard anything again, despite me reaching out to the hiring manager regarding their status in the selection process.

For another role (Manager), I was invited to do an online interview of recorded responses.  That process was horrible due to the technical difficulties of the process and also the inability to reach a real person to help alleviate the struggle of attempting to use this process.  It all felt extremely impersonal and there is no way to ask for clarity in a question or further understand what the interviewer was asking. I contacted the general recruitment regarding my inability to use the service and I was not granted any other opportunity to interview via an alternate approach.  I recommend not using this approach for externals at all or for anyone for that matter.  It is ineffective and not a good way to evaluate a candidate since the questions are limited, the anticipated responses are unrealistic, and there is no way to get the feel for ""who"" the interviewer is for evaluation of a prospective candidate and vice versa for the prospective candidate to get the feel for ""who"" the company or hiring management are as an employer.  

My thoughts are that J&J does not care about perspective candidates going through multiple versions of the process as a prospective candidate.  After the interview for the Manager role (approximately Nov 15), I interviewed and accepted a role with a local pharmaceutical company as Associate Director.  My feelings toward J&J, though I believe they have much to offer as an employer are negative to neutral based on my experiences"
"The recruitment process is extremely disheartening. 
I've applied for a few positions recently and, with the exception of 1 person who was fantastic, I was not treated very well (especially for an internal candidate). My emails were ignored when I reached out to the recruiter, I have not received any feedback and the answer to your question ""Did the recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to?"" would be NEVER. Following conversations in which the Talent Aquisition Specialist told me she would provide me with feedback following two interviews I received an automated email from one that I did not get the position and for the second she has never gotten back to me and just refuses to answer my emails (Interviews were in November). I find this exceptionally unprofessional and very much against our Credo.
Again, very disheartening!
"
"The recruitment process is currently quite generously speaking highly unprofessional and inadequate.
There is typically no feedback or update as to the whether the process is on-going, frozen and simply not selected (has occurred for another one of my submissions within PDMS)."
"The recruitment process is awful. I applied for three different positions at Johnson and Johnson  while I was working as a contractor with Johnson & Johnson. I was only called back by a recruiter for one of the positions and it was because I had asked internally regarding the position.  I was not contacted back regarding that position after my initial call. I had to contact the recruiter two months later to find out the status and was told that they would be looking to do interviews in a couple of months. I ended up leaving JNJ a month after they said they would be doing interviews and still have heard nothing more. I never heard back in any form on one of the jobs. On the third job that I applied for, I received an email saying that I wasn't chosen for the position with no further explanation. If that was the way I was treated in a building where everybody knew me and the people recruiting for the jobs knew me… I can't imagine how people outside of the company are treated."
"The recruitment process is a disgrace.   I have gone through this process 4 times in the last year and here are the results.
1.  Made it to interview with a company VP but was never told the results of the interview.  This was 6 months ago.  I reached out to the recruiter by email and phone but did not get a response.
2. Had a J & J recruiter phone screen and was told I was highly qualified and I could expect to have a follow-up interview.  I never heard any follow-up.  Again, I contacted the recruiter but he did not respond.
3. On two occasions I posted for a position but never received any communication. "
The recruitment process in this case was poor. I have had better experiences but I had to reach out to the recruiter to understand what was happening. The response was that this was a special case and did not flow the normal process but I was not accepted for the next stage. From this I understood that the post had been filled either prior to posting or the individual they wanted had applied.  I only had a tele interview with the recruiter even though I qualified for the post. 
"The recruitment process in general should be changed.
It is not a CV that demonstrate the soft skills. 
Each time I'm wondering if I lost my time to apply on a job that I have no idea about the process...
To select a candidate, I recommend LinkedIn !"
The recruitment process has been non-existing in my eyes. I just keep receiving these annoying emails asking me to take a survey. 
The recruitment process has been a joke.  I have been contacted by J & J HR numerous time and told I would be contacted for on site interviews.  I followed up numerous times and no response.  The two times I interviewed on site I have yet found out the outcome of the interview process.  Very misleading.  I have been told that J & J is doing this just to fill the need of applicants to check the box.  :(   
"The recruitment process for J&J did not even come close to meeting expectations relative to what I see at other companies... cumbersome process to apply, many months to fill your positions, lack of someone to contact, etc.  However, J&J is not like other companies... worth the hassle and wait.  

I recommend you hire me to value stream map your recruiting process to either improve the feedback portion ... possibly through automation, or by increasing the speed of the overall process by removing 11 forms of delays and waste.

Regarding this position, I was actually a great fit for it due to a startup I once owned, but in my excitement I failed to explain that in my cover letter, make a custom resume, etc... my fault.    "

Regarding this position, I was contacted by the hiring manager who told me that you currently had a lack of recruiters so he was taking the initiative to tell me that he really liked me, but that he hired someone from within.    "
"The recruitment process dragged on for months without any explanation for the delay.  The recruiter told me that I was a great fit for the position and that I would be brought in for an in-person interview.  However, months passed without any follow-up, until I eventually received a generic email stating that this position is no longer open."
"The recruitment process could improve by providing feedback with the applicants about their status of their application. 
Thank You."
"The recruitment process could be improved by providing candidates with precise feedback about why they weren't selected for positions that are a clear fit.  I worked for JNJ as a contractor for 2 years and proved that I was a cultural fit.  I received praise about my work from all whom I worked with including the hiring manager.  I think my prior work with the hiring manager may have been more of a handicap than a help.  During the phone interview with the hiring manager, I was never asked any specific questions about why I would be a good fit for the role.  I was asked a single question, which the hiring manager responded favorably to.  There was no follow up question to clarify my statements or truly assess how I could use my transferable skills to fill the role either.  When I asked for the final interview, I was told that it would be scheduled within the next two weeks.  Instead, I received a reject letter, which stated that ""the finalist"" was chosen to move on to the face-face interview.  The rejection letter also stated that ""It just takes persistence in your application for all roles that are a fit.""  What does that mean?  The recruiter provided no details about this statement. Given my immediate history with the company, I expected to at least get more specific feedback about why I wouldn't fit in the job.  Instead of asking specifically how I would do the work, she (the hiring manager) based her decision about my future performance upon past performances that called on different skills to be successful.  Thus, a true assessment of my abilities could not be adequately assessed, in my opinion.  If my resume was picked by the ATS as a good skills match and the hiring manager knows that I'm already a cultural match, why did I not at least get a final interview with the panel?  That made the recruitment process very bizarre, in my opinion.  Rather than recruiting for perfection in your candidates, try recruiting for potential instead.  You might be surprised by what you learn.  Also, advise hiring managers to provide pointed feedback.  It may seem that the recruitment system is awesome already, but clearly it needs work."
"The recruitment process at Johnson & Johnson, at least in my case, was a joke!
I was not even contacted once, either via call or email.
The position i applied to, i had all the skills and experiences mentioned in the requirement section of the job job description. so, if my resume lists all the skills required for the job, then how did company decide i am not the right fit, without even contacting and having a discussion with me?"
"The recruitment process at JNJ is broken.   We are a world class organization, the largest healthcare company in the world, but we have not figured out the talent development piece/recruitment.   As a manager for JNJ I have 4 opening I am currently filling and all of them I recruited my self, scouted off of linked Inn.   Recruitment has not provided me even one good candidate that has even made an Interview, yet we are paying out of our region budget once we post a position.   Furthermore, after applying for this position recently, it would be great to get some feedback (For Internal candidates who already work for JNJ) on why or why we are selected or not selected for various positions.  "
"The recruitment process at J&J is very messed up especially at the Raynham location.  I applied for a number of different positions and either never heard back from them or it was months later.  They open jobs, then put them on hold, then open as temp positions, then cancel, then open again - everyone (applicants and recruiters) are really confused.  I must have received nearly 50 calls from recruiters stating that I would be perfect for positions there, but they are all for positions that have been put on hold or cancelled.  The position I got this survey on (Manager Manufacturing Engineering (8926160223)) - I never heard from anyone.  My nephew works at J&J (near Cincinnati) and he tried to find out what is going on here and stated that their process is different than their process.  If you would to discuss further you can call me at 219-916-7936."
"The recruitment process at J&J could be improved substantially by actually  valuing the experience, work ethic and acumen of applicants who have outperformed their peers for more than 3 decades.  Demonstrate they truly value cultural diversity by interviewing and hiring individuals that fall outside the demographics of 25-40 years of age, have more than 5 years of industry experience and more than 3 jobs since graduating college.  Those screening applicants and hiring managers at J&J bypass a lot of talent by assuming applicants with more experience that the demographics mentioned would not be interested in or remain very long at a job with a salary range of the posted position.  I understand those reading my response will likely be inclined to dismiss my recommendations as they are the response from dismissed applicant.  Perception is often reality; I've shared my perspective and perception because you asked... that at least is a step in the right direction.  I wish the employees at J & J well. "
"The recruitment process across all industries has become very inefficient.  Submitting a resume is a guessing game and the likelihood that your resume will even be read is minimal.  As a person with a masters degree in leadership development, I find modern recruiting through online systems to be lacking the personal interaction required to truly identify qualified talent.

"
the recruitment notification need to be updated at all time
The recruitment life cycle is very long.  Extremely long.  
The recruitment for this job was poorly communicated. I received conflicting e-mails from various HR groups.  Frankly one group suggested as interview was coming while the internal consumer HR group suggested they had a pre-picked candidate. 
The recruitment department need to keep applicants up to date more.  
The Recruiting/Talent Acquisition Team should do a better job towards screening  applicant resumes in light of the requirement.
The recruiting process seems very automated and there is little feedback as to what prospective employees need on their resume or cover letters to be in a position to be requested for the next steps.
The recruiting process seems to have some flaws.  Particularly when it comes to internal candidates.
The recruiting process seems to have some flaws.  Particularly when it comes to internal candidates.
"The recruiting process is absolutely horrible. Had no indication what my application status was and waited almost one year for a response email indicating that I was not chosen for the role.  I was also a referral from a Sr. Director in the company - which ovbiously does not matter to the HR  dept.  You need to revamp the application process and keep candidates updated.  You should also consider giving referrals at least an interview/ phone screen as a courtesy.
Very dissappointed in the entire process - would have expected a much better experience from J&J."
The recruiting process could focus more on meeting potential candidates and viewing unique qualifications rather than focusing in a computer based selection process 
The recruiterso could do a more professional job. 
The recruiters should be more open to cross country employment. Talent is usually in the most unexpected places.
The recruiters need to respond to the applicants so we know what is going on. 
The recruiters need to communicate with the applicants.  Leaving the candidate in dark in regards the application status does not give the candidate any confidence that the organization has it's internal process all together.  It kind of gives the impression that the organization is dysfunctional.  
The recruiters appear to be over-worked.  They are slow to respond and there is inconsistent feeback and follow up.
The recruiter/hiring manager I dealt with explained that I would be scheduled for the next interview and then after repeatedly reaching out to him never heard back. Then the only piece of information I got was that they went with someone else. I just found it unprofessional to tell someone you are going to be scheduled for something and moving forward and then emails or calls are dodged and no feedback is given. I think if anything I should of got some feedback and that is all I wanted if I really was not a good fit. Also just be upfront with people that they are not going to be moving forward do not lead them on.
"The recruiter was working with me for this territory and then all of a sudden J&J decided to change the territory alignments and hired in a different territory and I was not in the running at all. It was very hard on me as I really want to join J&J. Please decide exactly what territory you need to hire in before you post the position. It would be easier for everybody, including J&J. Hopefully I will be able top join next go around. I did love the recruiter, Gary. He was very professional and cordial to me and made me feel important and not just another applicant. Thank you!!"
The recruiter was too provide feedback whether or not I was offered the position or not. While I was not offered the position neither did I receive any constructive feedback.
"The recruiter was quick to respond when I reached out to her, however, I made the initial inquiry. I was disappointed to know that my previous project management experience in the phamaceutical industry was not accepted as experience for this role in consumer, and therefore was not selected for an interview. I feel that this process would be improved if there was an opportunity to provide commentary in the 'requirement' fields so that potentially great candidates are not screened out due to a check box. For example, if the requirement was '10 years consumer experience' - I have 17 years of combined pharma and consumer experience that may have been acceptable to the hiring manager if they were given the opportunity to probe my business knowledge in those areas. Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback! "
"The recruiter was great. I was very disappointed in the management interview. The follow up was much later than had been communicated. When I did finally hear from a manager for an in person interview, the interview was a disappointment. I was contacted that the interview was going to start late. When I arrived, I could over here the entire interview of the gentleman interviewing before me. Once my interview did begin, the first interview question was concerning why I wanted to leave me current position. I had been displaced from my job in January, so it seemed that no one had reviewed my resume. The second question was ""Are you ever confrontational?"". I thought that was a strange question for an interview. I knew that I had no chance in getting this job after the second question. I just wish that I hadn't wasted $300 on a hotel room so as to make the interview on time. The interview was in a very expensive hotel in Atlanta. I don't think badly of J and J. I just think that I wasn't really ever a serious candidate, which I find unfortunate. I really wanted to be part of the J and J Family. 

Sincerely,
Meredith M. Renfro"
"The recruiter was great until she handed over the interview process to the hiring manager.  The communication with the hiring manager's administrative assistant was poor.  They confirmed my interview date two business days before the interview.  A range of tentative dates were set but confirmation occurred at the last minute.  The admin provided no help with travel arrangements or directions.  When the interview was completed there was no debrief explaining next steps; I was literally shown the door.  

After the interview I contacted the admin about miscellaneous travel expenses and I was told that JnJ does not pay these.  I had to contact the hiring manger via LinkedIn because they would no provide their business card or contact info.  Through LinkedIn I inquired about reimbursement of my travel expenses.  Three weeks later the hiring manager approved the expenses and I was paid.

I had tremendous respect for JnJ, however, this experience has really given me second thoughts on how JnJ conducts business an treats its employees."
"The recruiter that called me from j and j called me to sell her business. She's a career coach.  She works at j and j as a recruiter and at the same time promotes her business as a coach.   I though 

Not bad!  

"
"The recruiter stated he was very interested in going forward with the next phase of the interview and was going to contact the hiring managers. 
He told me he would call me back in a few days and verified my contact information and email address. He also stated he would email me his contact information shortly after our conversation. When I attempted to contact him via the phone number he initially called me from I reached technical support and no one had any idea whom to contact.
I would respectfully ask that the recruiter contact me as I have some very unique qualifications that 99.9 % of the representatives do not have.
Sincerely,

"The recruiter should provide more feedback and updates to candidates. During the initial screening interview with her, I had contacted her about the status, she didn't contact me. I had to follow up with her a few times to hear of the status. I found out that the position was offered to and accepted by another candidate from the hiring manager through an email.  I never heard from the recruiter about this."
The recruiter should have the decency to email the interviewee back when the interviewee emails them and ask for feedback on why they didn't get the position. One of the interviewer came off very unwelcoming during the interview. 
"The recruiter should have contacted me as to why I was not in the selection process, especially since I am a prior JNJ employee.  "
The recruiter should have called to discuss the position.
The recruiter should contact me and provide a reason why I were not a good fit for the position I applied to.
"The recruiter should be prepared with interview questions and familiar with the role.  The interview didn't ""flow"", there were periods of silence (I am guessing he was reading notes?).  I sent a thank you email, but never heard anything back directly from the recruiter.  I did receive a generic rejection notice."
"The recruiter should be able to adjust to the development of the interview considering the rational diversity of the candidates. The recruiter should not be limited to following a script where it restricts the candidate's sincerity and even limits him in expressing his ideas. For the second time I had the experience that my interviewer interrupted me by not allowing me to complete my ideas giving the feeling of hostility in the process which is not aligned with the values ​​of JnJ. Based on my knowledge and experience she has a minimum knowledge of the subject so if the candidate delves into ideas she can not adjust to the conversation.
In addition the recruiter must maintain impartiality at all times (in my interview I could know that they were going to recruit a man) and above all to avoid communicating their input with body language to security employees who even looked at me with regret when leaving.
Recommendation:
1. Panel interview to incorporate the vision in the specific field of the position and thus allows to add objectivity to the process.
2. Create awareness to the recruiter that the candidate is also evaluating the company profile through it."
The recruiter sent an email indicating they had chosen not to pursue my candidacy for this position but Did Not provide a reason for why it was not a good fit. It would be helpful if a reason was given. Thanks
"The recruiter said she was getting in touch with me because my resume had been pre-screened by the business group.  I answered all her questions positively and she left me with the upbeat feeling that I should hear from someone soon. Not only that, but that there was more than one opportunity for a forecaster.  I never heard back and had to email the recruiter to ask for a response."
The recruiter provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position that you applied for.
The recruiter or the HR never contacted me or provide me a reason for my resume not being shortlisted.
"The recruiter never contacted me. Simply forwarded my resume to the hiring manager. The hiring manager and member of his team interviewed me in a ""check the box"" style employed by Big Pharma. I could tell right away, I was being used as interview fodder. I never received any feedback from him or the recruiter regarding my status. Completely wasted my time. Very unprofessional. "
"The recruiter never contacted me, and called the J&J employee who referred me by my name instead of by their name.  There was no feedback at all regarding the position.

A response, even one that indicates that J&J will not be moving forward with my application, should always be sent to people who apply. "
The recruiter never contacted me to set up an interview.  No interview took place.
"The recruiter never contacted me thus, I have to say the whole overall process canbe improved. My husband is a CPA,JD and he had a similar experience. Thank you very much,
Diane Black,MS,RD,CDE All But Dissertation"
The recruiter never contacted .. received this survey without an interview..
"The recruiter needs to reach out. At a minimum, by email. "
"The recruiter must give short but specific  feedback why you doesn't fit with the position, the communication is always generalist being using for all."
"The recruiter made me think I got the job and that I will be contacted by either her or the manager early the following week while they do background check, etc. Still haven't heard form either of them."
The recruiter is very nice and gave me more details in relating to my interview. I am deeply appreciate her effort to keep me inform.
"The recruiter I worked with was kind and honest, but it was difficult to get updates from her and I wonder had I not reached out if I would have heard anything at all. "
"The recruiter I spoke with was very nice and she emailed and called me a couple of times. We really didn't discuss why I was not a good fit for the position because I really didn't interview or have much interaction about the actual position. I was internally reffered from a friend I used to work with at a previous company, I then applied online, and then I received a notice that I was not being move forward. 

The reason my answers to questions 3,4,and 5 are because I just don't have enough data to commit either way. From my external point of view I really like J&J although my recent interaction was very abrupt. I am a Army veteran and I am serving in the National Guard as an officer and I like what I read about J&J and their support to their veteran/military employees. I am with a company now that maybe does not understand the value a military member brings and lastly I think it is pretty awesome that the CEO of J&J is a former fellow Army Officer. 

"
"The recruiter I dealt with - Julia Brown - was very nice but likely young, inexperienced and did not represent the company well at all. She knew nothing about the position and could not get me an answer on timing of things."
"The recruiter from J&J was strong, but she was left out of the loop from the hiring manager at Janssen at the end. The process was smooth for each of the 3 interviews I had, until the end when I didn't hear anything for a couple of weeks. I think they moved a little slow on notifying me when I was not selected to move to the finals, and I didn't receive feedback around why until after I inquired. Overall the process was okay, but as a candidate trying to weigh different opportunities, it was a bit frustrating to be kept in the dark at the end, when I suspect that the candidate they did move forward with knew right away... "
"The recruiter for this position, Mr. Alex Saunders, was fantastic. His professionalism, enthusiasm and timely updates were very much appreciated and upstaged only by his hand-written thank you note that was mailed to my house! I could not be more impressed by his kindness and obvious commitment to live by the Credo and values that Johnson and Johnson stand for.

Sincerely,

James Citak"
"The recruiter either getting in touch with you via letter, email, phone call letting you know you didn't get the job  before receiving a survey from J&J."
The recruiter doesn't seem to know anything- simply say- contact hiring manager for feedback.  Where is value add in that?
The recruiter does not have any knowledge of the tool or software. And he does not treat with respect. 
"The recruiter did not reach out to me, I received an automated email. This was a very non-personalized process.
"
The recruiter did not follow up as promised and show lack of respect to potential candidates.
"The recruiter did not contact with me at all. The computer scans will miss out of a lot  of high quality of skill candidates. As a certified quality professional from the ASQ and IRCA and have a pharmaceutical background,  my  qualification and working experience in an ISO 9001 QMS and Good Manufacturing/Clinical/Laboratory Practices will be a significant value to your organization. Unfortunately, the J & J does not care about that! The J & J is an American company so you should take a consideration of someone who received an education and working experience from  the United States of America first! The J & J is the number of ranking of pharmaceutical and medical device company in the world so I would like to work for the J & J,  unfortunately,  the J & J does not give me a chance to work for your organization! This is my third times to apply for a job at the J & J .

How to improve the recruitment process? Get rid of computer scan and use a human being to go through the process. Select the high quality of candidates base on the qualifications and certifications. Do the J & J will take my words??"
The recruiter could contact the person via phone or email to let the applicant know if the company has any interest in the applicant. 
"The recruiter contacted via me on March 8, 2017 and could not find time to speak with me until March 21st for a phone screening. On March 16th I emailed asking if the position was still available because of his failure to respond. I felt like I was chasing after him. My expectations were low by March 21st when we finally spoke. The screening felt like charity by that time. He told me that the next step would be for him to get back to me. On April 4th I received a genetic email from J&J notifying me that I was not selected. I was surprised to get even that based on my experience with Lee Manning."
the recruiter contact me and provide a reason why I was not a good fit for the position I applied to?
the recruiter contact me and provide a reason why I was not a good fit for the position I applied to
The recruiter can reach out to internal candidates and keep in communication with them. 
"The recruiter can be in more contact with the candidate during the start of the interview process.  For example I have applied for many positions and I do not get any correspondences until about 2 months later that I am not selected for the position.  It would be nice to know that I was not selected for the first round of inteviews and not at the end when the position has been filled and closed.I understand that maybe this is the process, which then would allow a re-evaluation of the candidates if none are qualified, but a simple notificationt that the interview process has started would let me know that I was not selected at first, but there is hope."
"The recruiter called, but did not go through interview screening, only concern the salary requested too much.  However, he stated that he will discuss with company about the salary range.  I have to email/call several times to follow up with him.  Finally talked to him, and he said my experience is not match with what they are looking for.  This is very confusing screening process, because the reason changed every time we talked.  "
The recruiter called me to interview for a position. We had a quick conversation and they said they were going to pass my information along to the manager.  After numerous follow ups with the recruiter once I didn't hear from the manager - I received an automated e-mail about three weeks later letting me know J&J decided to go with another candidate.  I felt like the recruiter could have called if there was a mistake - instead of after numerous follow ups with no response just sending an automated message.
The recruiter always must contact the candidate to clarify any information related to the application answer. This will be the candidate to express his expertise related to the position base on the requirements
"The reason why I am not selected for the position. I am not looking for to challenge J&J decision for not having selected me, I totally respect it; but I need to know what I should improve for future job applications, what I did wrong during the interview, what are my weaknesses, etc."
The reason I received for not advancing was that it was decided the position was no longer needed.  To the extent possible it should be decided whether a job opportunity truly and realistically exists before it is posted and interested candidates invest time in applying.  
The reason I received for not advancing was that it was decided the position was no longer needed.  To the extent possible it should be decided whether a job opportunity truly and realistically exists before it is posted and interested candidates invest time in applying.  
"The question should be what can't you do? You took forever to just deny me even the chance to be interviewed for a job that I was very qualified to do. In fact, I know I would be excellent. I don't apply to a job unless I know I match what the employer is looking for. My level of experience in the area I applied is unmatched in the industry. You never even gave me the time of day. Great survey."
"The process where I can see is good enough, but sometimes I would like to understand why the requirements does not match with my skills, in general the process is very good."
The process was very lengthy over a couple of months and 3 face to face interviews with the manager. It felt like she was just dragging her feet.
The process was very erratic. The hiring manager was very slow in response and it became very obvious that manager was very hesitant to hire me due to concerns of my experience and relationships with her management. Ageism is alive and well and disappointed that managers are not better trained on benefits of hiring people of stature and skills.
The process was user friendly and at this point I do not foresee any improvement is needed
The process was streamlined and easy to follow.  A bit confusing though to receive the feedback  survey before I learned about wether I was moving  forward in search.  
The process was sterile and cold. 
the process was not very personalized. it seemed very automated.
"The process was longer than usual, It took almost 4 month's to finalize the results. 
I didn't receive any call from the recruiter by herself. However, I had to tell her that I have been waiting for the results and I have couple of other offers. Please share the result so that I could decide accordingly. 

I would like to provide my feedback on the process duration it should be reduced so that candidates not need to wait for longer time."
"The process was inconsistent with communication. Till this day, I have not received any feedback on information on why I was not a good fit nor if the position was even filled? I had/have high regard for J&J until this process, it's my 2nd time interviewing and the process is quite biased and I am afraid discriminatory in nature (interviewer panel member). The process was the proverbial ""waste of time"" because one member had already determined the outcome. I would have been much happier with ""thanks for your application but at this time there is not a fit possible"".  This way I would have avoided 3-days out of my clinic without pay.  I understand J&J wants to meet with all standards on diversity but I feel as if I was interviewed so that the dept/panel would have a slate of diverse candidates and then dismiss me as a qualified hire.  Hard to think otherwise with no follow up communication. I do appreciate the time, expense and other peripheral team's efforts. Thank you.  Tom Young, MS, PhD, NP/Medical Science Liaison Interview Candidate. "
"The process was good and the feed back happened.
"
"The Process was extremely painful the system crashes several times and I never heard anything back for several months plus I was a employee referral candidate so to hear nothing back was very unprofessional! 
"
The process was extremely impersonal. More direct feedback is valuable and could result in referrals.
The process was extremely impersonal. It would be valuable to have more direct feedback in a more timely manor.  
"The process was excessively long for me which was acceptable in the sense that I really want to join J&J, but I had to follow up a number of times before I received a reply after my phone interview and between phone interview and in person interview. I was bit disappointed that after having received my rejection email and sending a thank you email stating that "" Although I am very disappointed, I respect J&J's decision and sincerely appreciate everyone's time and assistance throughout the process. I sincerely feel privileged to have been granted an interview and the opportunity to present myself to J&J and I will continue in my goal to join the J&J team. Please provide me any feedback that you may have regarding my interview process and/or that may make me a more viable candidate in the future, or how I may improve as I continue to seek out opportunities at J&J"", for which I have not received a reply which may be J&J's policy and that is understandable, but I really wish I would have received some feedback to improve for next time. The only significant issue was the interview room which was very small for 3 people and the room was extremely hot and very uncomfortable for myself and the interviewers and as a friendly suggestion for the future, a conference room is a better option. I would still like to join J&J and I would go through the process again!  "
"The process was effective.

I appreciate that I received a response, even though I was not moved on in the process.

I hope to be considered for future positions

Regards,

D.J. Pack"
The process was easy to get to and easy to apply. It was a fine process. 
The process was easy and straight forward. Only draw back was not follow on if position was filled.
"The process was cold and very final. Do the opposite. It was so quick and final.

I understand what you are doing and it is understandingly calculating."
"The process takes too long, and it seems nobody is making decisions in key steps.....I was told something at the early stages, and then I was told the opposite things in the later stages......talked with other candidates privately, and all f us were very confused. It seems that the ideal candidate is a moving target even for hiring managers..."
"The process takes a very long time to play out. First contact by an actual recruiter can take as long as 6 months. When contacted, there will be a decision provided but no feedback as to why the decision has been made. Additionally, your automated system provides acknowledgement of receipt of application immediately, which is fine but does not communicate that a person is evaluating the application.
The company has  great reputation but I've heard from recent employees that the environment is not very good at this time. I've heard that there is much too much bureaucracy and politics involved with working at the company. "
"The process should be broaden to consider applicant's capability to perform given his/her track records in a different industry. 
If J&J limited to only people with healthcare background then you may missed out some excellent candidates with a diverse background and can provide different perspective in problem solving."
The process seems very straightforward. More personalized feedback on why a candidate is selected would be helpful. 
The process seemed largely impersonal and as though my applications went into a huge black hole. I only ever received automated replies and some were many months after my submission.
"The process of applying was organized and easy to complete. This survey seems to indicate that a recruiter was involved. My experience was only through the website and digital response. A cover letter was submitted indicating an interest in the Finance Division and I would still welcome speaking with a recruiter about my capabilities for employment within this division. Johnson & Johnson could improve upon this process by having an option within the Talent Community to have a conversation/interaction with a real person. Thank you.
"
The process needs to be quicker. it took almost 4 months to hear anything. 
The process needs to be more personalized. Candidates are removed from consideration based on what I assume to be search criteria. If a recruiter looked outside the box and spoke to people they would end up with better employees.
The process needs to be a little bit faster to inform one whether they are a good fit or not. 
"The process must be transparent and fair. If the position opportunity is just for local/region candidates, it should not be opened for out of that. I have applied for many opportunities where I have enough skill, competences, knowledge or above, but I was not considered be part of the process."
"The process must be more transparent and fair. If the position opportunity is just for local/region candidates, it should not be opened for out of that."
The process is very slow for jobs that I believe I am a direct fit for. For jobs that I'm not a good fit the response is quick and I appreciate that. Thanks!
"The process is too long. WAY too long. It's a sales career.  This isn't rocket science, besides, all you want to do is hire the prettiest girl you find, even though she might have the common sense of a 6 year old. The medical/pharmaceutical industry seems to have an inflated idea of how important these sales positions are. It's not even sales.  It's marketing."
"The process is one of the worst job application processes I have ever been apart of.  There is no coordination between the candidate and the recruiter, the recruiter sent me the wrong info twice, and the recruiter replied to me via another candidate's email. 

It also appears that everyone wants ""leaders"" but we do not seem to want people to execute and do the work.  We need to show higher emphasis on results in candidates and a little less in ""leadership potential"".  Too many generals, not nearly enough soldiers"
"The process is good so far. This is the second survey I am filling in, hope someone will get in touch with me over the phone so that I know this is serious. Thanks"
"The process is fine, it's very efficient to be notified but also very disappointing. It's hard to be excited about a company that has rejected you"
the process is easy and pleasant.
The process is clear ind intuitive. But it would be nice to know why I an rejected for a position that I am more than qualified for. Thanks
The process is a waste.these looks to be not real opportunities.
The process has taken a really long time and there was  never any message (not even a generic e-mail) to notify that you were not considered for the position. 
The process has been different for each of the positions I've applied for.  There is no consistency in the process.
The process felt very mechanical. There was no personal touch.
"The process feels very impersonal. Surely there are qualified candidates that are being overlooked by the existing online system. Placing a face, voice, or identity to this process would soften the experience without lowering your standards.  Our society has enough automation, be unique, standout, and get personal. Thank you, Laurel Bloch"
The process ends at resume submittal.  There is no contact about experience and skill set fit. And there is zero follow up if a person is not selected.
The process could be much faster it was very slow. 
The process could be improved if a person instead of a program would take the time to look at resumes of people applying to senior level jobs. I feel the people with the experience and leadership are being over looked due to certain words not appearing on a resume. 
The pre recorded interview was tricky. I feel like that it wasn't very personable. There were only three questions and it was hard to answer some of the questions in two minutes. I feel that it was unfair. I would much rather present myself in person or even over Skype. 
The position was withdrawn or filled before the process could move forward
The position was pulled. There was no opportunity. 
"The position was pulled, not that I was a good fit, so the question about the rationale was provided, just not exactly in the context of the first question.   J&J is a great company I think.   High regard for it.

Stephen"
The position was filled with an internal candidate. Even with three internal (including an internal VP level) referrals I was never contacted by recruiting via email or phone. The only contact was an email stating the position was filled with an internal candidate. A check in email/phone call stating that we are reviewing your experience and fit would be appreciated.
The position was eliminated so it's not a qualification issue
The position was cancelled due to changing business needs so I never interacted with the talent acquisition team or had experience with the J&J recruitment process to provide feedback in that area. I applied online & then received the cancellation notice a few weeks later.  
The position I had applied for had special circumstances whereas the existing Director was transitioning his role to a US Director and unfortunately there was ambiguity in who had the final say in candidate.  I applied for the role in August and met with the US Director and was told in October that the Recruiter had changed and they would be reposting the role.  I was told that I was still a viable candidate and there was no need to reapply.  I met with the new HR recruiters in I believe late October.  The US hiring Director kept me engaged with updates and in mid January the US Director advised me that an internal candidate had been identified and the role had been given to him.  I was a J&J employee for 4 years and it was a great moment in my career and truly respect the company and the US Director I would have reported into but the hiring process was plagued with ambiguity and setbacks. 
The position I applied for was cancelled so I have no review on this.
"The position I applied for was canceled.  I never entered the interview process, so I cannot comment on the recruitment process although I still think highly of J&J as an organization."
"The position appeared to be a good fit for me but all I received was a canned email saying other candidates were better suited for the position. Within 2 weeks of this note a firm called me asking if I would be interested in taking a temporary position with your company to do M&A work and specifically a carve out situation. Here to I was qualified but by the time the agency was able to put my paperwork in front of the decision maker, the company brought someone else on to fill the role."
"The position and recruitment process were well explained. The interviews emphasis was the apropriate one in my understanding. Obviously , I would like to be recruited, I expect to have other opportunities in the near future."
"The point above...I believe I had all the skills for the job..but still not sure, no one contacted me..."
The phone screener could have been more knowledgable about the position and more professional.
The phone interview seemed to have gone well. Any feedback as to the reason for not being considered for the position would be helpful in the job search. 
"The personal touch has been taken out of it.  Having to rely on just your resume doesn't always work.  I think you need to put the Person back into the picture.  If you have someone call each applicant to speak to them about either why you didn't fit or why you thought they might it would give a clearer picture to the applicant on what they need to improve their resume.  Look I know you get around 200 applications for each job, but still hire someone to call each one. Seriously!"
"The person I spoke with from the department I was interested in was very dismissive, and curt.  Phone interviews can be hard to read people but J&J should be careful about who they select to interview people on the phone as these are your first impressions of the department you may be working in.

As well, regular status of the interviewing process is helpful to keep prospective candidates engaged.  I know that the role I was interested in was eventually eliminated but it would good to let people know status/updates."
"The period of time between applying and getting the ""we have filled the position"" notice is a huge gap in time. Very ineffecient."
"The overall process was very good.  The Recruiter did call to tell me I was not selected due to an internal candidate.  The Recruiter and the Global EHSS Director thought I was a fit for Johnson & Johnson; however the position in Vacaville, California was given to an internal candidate.  In the future, it would be a good idea for the hiring manager to clarify  there is an internal candidate applying for the position.  Overall, I believe Johnson and Johnson is great company and I would be a pleasure to interview again, if a position became available."
The overall experience was positive. More timely updates on the status of the process could make the experience better for the candidate. 
The only way to supply is with an internal person as a referral
The only thing I ever got was this survey email. 
"The only response/feedback I received was an automated email stating ""We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Director, Quality Operations (9215160301) at Depuy Orthopaedics. Inc.""  The response was appreciated because I never received any responses back for positions at other companies I have applied to, but it then odd to be getting this survey asking ""Did the recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to?"" when I was, in fact, not ever contacted by a J&J recruiter."
The only recommendation That I can give you as a Prominent Company it's that the person who recruits have to be more considerable and ask questions beyond his or her intelligence. When you recruited people around the world or for a University you need to prepared a business plan and see if that country or the student can bring or leave business to the company. Every Recruitment means money and there's no way to put in jeopardy the recognition of the company.Recruitment its not only to review a resume or because he or she sound good or has a lot of study it's more than that. Student Recruitment in my experience means money. 
The only notification I received was that the position had been cancelled- not that I was not qualified or that they moved ahead with someone else. I am looking for a remote marketing role and if one comes up again I would like the opportunity to submit for the position.
"The only method of contact was the repeated asks to take this survey. A recruiter never reached out to me about my application, nor did I get a response that I was not being considered for the role."
"The only feedback that is given is when the position if filled and you are no longer being considered for the position.  I don't mind not getting a position, but J&J does nothing to let people know what is going on."
"The ONLY feedback I get is:
1. a TOTALLY generic rejection letter
2. This survey request."
"The only feedback from J&J was confirmation of receipt of the application.  There has been no further communications since.  The online process was cumbersome and the UX frustrating with long wait times for answers to load and frequent requests to 'add missing info' that was already uploaded.  

J&J is known as a family oriented and global citizen interested in the individual's well being.  While I fully understand the purpose behind leveraging recruitment software; it does impact the overall impression of the company as a whole.  I would suggest implementing a feedback loop to everyone who has applied confirming that they are not being moved forward for consideration and thanking them for their interest, etc...

"
The only contact that I had after the form email saying I had applied for a position was this survey.  I never heard a word but why would anybody call a candidate with an MBA and 20 years of retail/consumer goods experience?  How could a candidate like that ever fit in your organization?  
The ONLY contact I received was a rejection letter.
"The only contact I received from the recruiter was a letter months later saying they have other more qualified candidates. I used to work for J&J before my small company was sold to another corporation. I am well qualified as an ex-division manager for J&J with very high rating for myself and my team. I was also a managed care account director, which adds value to my experience. To not merit a be call telephone interview does not make sense to me.  "
The only contact I got was the repeated emails to complete this survey. What hiring process are you talking about? I applied for a job and then I get this survey.  
"The only contact I get is these surveys. I have gone as far as reaching out to the lead recruiter on LinkedIn asking what I need to be a better candidate or be acknowledged (outside of my 10+ years of experience, proven track record and 2 Masters Degrees). I receive no response."
The only communication I received was for a survey. Consider putting the survey team in charge of all future communications.
"The only communication I received was an email that they had chosen not to pursue my candidacy.  I don't know if it was because I was not qualified, over qualified or there were other candidates that were a better fit.  Nothing.  Candidates find this very frustrating."
The online system is not easy to navigate.
"The online process seems like an empty space into nowhere. I've applied to over 40 positions that I was well qualified for and or a perfect fit and received no feedback at all. I often wonder if the submission really goes somewhere. It's been a disappointing process. Feedback would be a nice plus, esp for employees of the company. "
"The online filtering of potential employees needs to be revamped. I didn't check one of the boxes - even though I should have after discussing why I wasn't qualified with a ""different"" HR person interviewing me for a different position (I didn't check the box as a result of too many qualifications listed in one sentence). Out of a 100% qualification for the sentence, I was about 90% qualified - I didn't check the box because I felt the company wanted someone with a 100% qualification rating. I was wrong!! That's OK. Thanks. 
  "
"The online application system seems to filter out my applications before they can be seen by a recruiter.  I have applied to numerous positions at Johnson & Johnson, and I have not yet been contacted by a recruiter.  I would be pleased to speak with someone regarding employment opportunities.  Thank you!

"The online application process was easy to use and the instructions were well explained.  The fact that a recruiter nor anyone from HR did not contact me was not a surprise. I simply figured that J&J receives so many potential candidates that there was not time to approach everyone.  I was not offended.  Of course, I was disappointed not to even receive a call back or interview, as I believe my skills would be beneficial to J&J/Janssen's mission either in the CMC capacity or within the global regulatory affairs area.  The recruitment process, being informal, is still effective and in no way influences my respect for J&J.  It would be a pleasure to contribute to J&J success in helping patients.   Thank you, 
Brett "
The online application process is intuitive and easy to use.
"The one thing I would suggest for improvement following my experience as a candidate is to provide more timely feedback or information about recruitment status after each stage of of the process: this is because after interviews in December I have not received any feedback from the company or contact, and a month is passed.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback.

"
"The official notification from J&J, about not being selected, come months after being notified by the recruiter. Not sure why the disconnect in the timing."
The notice that I didnt get selected came almost a year after I applied to the role. 
The next time someone from the recruitment team goes on maternity leave. Make sure the other recruiters have the potential hires information and not leave them to fend for themselves. And not have to contact the VP of the acquisition department. 
"The new website, ""My Next Step"" is terrible. Not being able to narrow to a department within a functional area or a state within a country? Not to mention that there is no training and no way to save jobs as previously. The new HR process means I literally have no idea who my HR partner is, and I have never spoken to a recruiter directly. While this is appropriate for jobs within my department, I have never actually had ANY contact with a recruiter, not even a follow-up e-mail. I have no one to give feedback to, and no discussion, presentation, or overview on how to search for jobs in the new site. The process of looking for jobs is becoming extremely unsatisfactory. Unless you actually KNOW the job exists, they are virtually impossible to find. "
the new recruitment page is more porfesional looking but there is no job cart that I can see and teh search is limited and information is not present such as how long teh job was open (posting date) and sorting is not present. So more functionality when revieweing jobs. 
The new job website is very hard to navigate. You should be able to put in a company or city within Johnson and Johnson and pull up all the jobs for that field. The old job site was more user friendly.
"The My Next Step Portal can be improved greatly.  I tried to search for a position by Req# and 3 different jobs came up, none of which were the position I was looking for.  I also received 3 duplicate emails informing me that my application was under review.  There are a lot of bugs that make the portal not user friendly."
"The most important part to me is getting a decision - no matter what that decision is.  There are some companies that rely on the job board's closed status to let the applicant know that this job has been filled.  
You provided an email to let me know my status.  More feedback is always helpful, but I understand how one job opening may have over 100 applicants and that it is not always possible. "
The mobile experience is good. 
"The minimal J&J can do is to improve or fix the automated filter. I understand than multiple (many) applications for a job are done permanently and it is difficult to contact every applicant.

But if you don't know the trick you don't pass the first filter and you are not considered at all.

If I applied is because I have the skills but unfortunately I was not considered.

The machine-generated email is quite good. It's unfortunate that the position was canceled.
"The low score on my viewpoint of J&J stems from the fact that i was never contacted for a phone screen or anything similar in the process, which is very frustrating given that my qualifications matched very nicely with the postings requirements. 

"
"The lack of communication contributed to my scores. I am beyond qualified for the positions I applied for but all I received was ""not the right fit"". I would like to see J & J become the pioneers that would at least let candidates know why they weren't chosen. As a prospective candidate, we cant change anything if we don't know the cause. I have emailed an inquiry as to what the reason was that I was not at least chosen to interview and I have never gotten a response.

Thank You :)"
"The lack of communication about whether I was still a candidate or being considered is less then forthcoming.  I would expect that once you get to the interview stage, or multiple interviews, you should be notified of whether or not you're still being considered.  In this case, that did not happen.  The only reason  you know you're no longer considered is lack of response within a certain period of time."
"The Johnson and Johnson must encourage those persons who are showing interest to join  Johnson and Johnson. They must feedback them without delay.

with high regards,
Dr. Afzal"
The job sight isn't very easy to navigate around especially when trying to modify your personal profile 
"The job search portal is not user-friendly at all. it is very difficult to get back to the original search field. Often, the geographic area resets for no reason. It was very discouraging not what I had expected from J&J.
I have never been contact by a recruiter only automated emailed responses. "
"The job posting was for a Plant Controller. The following was the process -1) J&J posted the opening on the internet, 2) I applied through the internet, 3) received a standard rejection notice through the internet and 4) requested to fill out this survey through the internet. 

Not a lot of concern or communication for the person applying for a higher level position. At least J&J sent a notice informing me of the status which is better than most larger companies.

"
The job I applied for was interesting.  It was pulled down and no longer available so I received an email letting me know this.  I did not have personal interaction with the recruiter.  
"The job I applied for ,I was told, put on hold 
So my answers reflect that"
"The JNJ recruiter who contacted me said that she would get back to me and I never heard from her again.  I followed up twice asking her to confirm simply that she had received my message, but nothing.  I figured she had left the company herself.  I have a very high opinion of JNJ as a company, but not as a recruiting employer.  I am gainfully employed in the medtech space so I wasn't disappointed that I didn't become a JNJ employee.  I was just disappointed that I took the time to even explore an opportunity because of the unprofessional nature of the HR and recruiting department.  This is meant as constructive criticism because it is a great company and the external face of the recruiting organization should be much better than it is.  Finally, I am impressed that you are conducting a survey to find out how to fix the process.  Good luck!"
"The J&J Recruitment process is among the worst I have seen in the Pharmaceutical Industry, great company lousy at recruitment."
"The J&J process worked pretty well, other than the fact that it missed identifying a highly talented candidate like me.  I was not identified by a recruiter, but rather applied after finding the position on LinkedIn.  Perhaps these questions make more sense if a recruiter is involved."
"The J&J process is not friendly to new candidates. I rarely, if ever waste my time with applying or going thru the process. J&J does not have he reputation the recruiters think as a ""good"" company to apply for.  Perhaps working there is better, but I am not holding my breath that they know what they are doing. "
"The J&J process is indistinguishable from 95% of all others, information goes into a black hole and never comes out. "
"The J&J career website is user friendly. 

However, I believe my background fit the position ( Senior Scientist, Assay Development, Screening (4475161220) very well. I have a lots of experience of immunology, molecular, and cell based assay, independently developed a few crucial products for current company. The hiring manager should reconsider my application. When managers select candidates, it will be nice for them to look at the big picture of the candidates:  accomplishment in the past, broad and deep knowledge, attitude and potential, not only a few key words, or US degree.  It will be also possible for top companies to have the option creating suitable positions for strong candidates. On the other hand, I would like to have the rejection letter with detail reasons instead of general notice (unfortunately, no company is doing that) to help candidates to improve their job search experience and career path.  

I sincerely wish Johnson & Johnson will be doing even better in the future, at meantime,  I am truly hoping I can hear back from you. 

Best !

"The interviews were either too short (30 min) or too long (60 min). If they were all 45 minutes each, that would have been a good amount of time."
The interviewer was racist and bully. One of them came with predefined notion to reject me. That was evident from the introduction process. He laughed at me. I will never recommend anyone to join J&J
"The interviewer Frankie McLean was very unprofessional and unprepared for the entire process. I have 15 years of Cardiology/Hospital Account experience. I had 7 letters of recommendation from key Cardiologists within the territory. I have won 8 National Sales awards and was the #1 Cardiology Hospital rep in the Nation at Novartis. I had 2 internal referrals from JNJ (Janssen) employees. One of the referrals would have been my partner (Jeff Adams). All of these factors should have been considered. Frankie chose a candidate with no Hospital Account experience and had not won a single National sales award. The candidate was subsequently turned down by the Regional Director Tim Conniff. Frankie sent another candidate and was turned down by Tim again. I do not understand how I was overlooked. I have spoke to several JNJ employees that are aware of the situation and all agreed that Frankie dropped the ball. Thanks for letting me share my experience.... Tom Luvender
"
The interview process was extremly disheartening and I did not receive ANY contact or feedback. As an internal candidate I would expect more. Not at all following our CREDO.
The interview process should be inclusive.
"The interview process did not skew my view of the company. It skewed my view of the hiring process. 

I would LOVE to receive constructive criticism or a reason as to why I was not a good fit. In my opinion my credentials were spot on.
"
The initial application process was one of the best I have ever seen and then no contact. Need to engage applicants through the process.
"The information about why I wasnt a good candidate was in accurate. They recommended updating my resume, which I had. So I have no idea where the confusion was. "
"The in-person interview started late and each interviewer was even later.  The one candidate was kept separate from the rest of us, we all were interested in why that individual was kept separate when he told us he was also interviewing for the same position.  I asked questions about the position and I was told this is still just a personality assessment and no details were provided."
"The human element of the process is missing.

I think the applicant need to speak with personnel from the Talent Acquisition Team, in order to get a sense of the position, also I believe you need to meet the applicant to determine if they are not qualified for a position. There are character components that can not be seen in text which could be vital in determining if the applicant is qualified,

Thank you."
The HR representative never replied when I asked for feedback from the interviews after receiving notification that I was not selected. Please provide feedback or at least reply to the request with a response. 
"The HR in JnJ should forward the applicant's resume to the respective hiring line managers based on the matching criteria, especially for experienced candidates. The hiring line manager's take the necessary decision whether to invite the candidates for an interview or not rather than the HR deciding or making the decision. The overall application and processing time need to be reduced as it can cause JnJ to lose some of the highly valuable, educated and experienced job applicants to its competitors. Also JnJ should give more preference to online applicants based on their merits and experience rather than choosing applicants for interview based on internal referrals / recommendations."
The hiring team already knew this position was getting re structured but this wasn't taken into account while calling me for the interview. I was asked to attend 4 phone  interviews which also included the initial HR interview and 1 personal interview with 3 different people. I felt like my time wasn't valued since the decision to restructure was already know prior to my interviews 
The hiring process had become extremely difficult and disheartening. It would be nice if recruiters respected candidates and not play mind games. If your not interested then be honest instead of leading them along. Also provide feedback after an interview to possibly help them on their future search especially if they ask. 
The hiring manager needs to better communicate with the recruiter. The recruiter offered the position as a Regular Full Time Position but the hiring manager told me the position was a temp only. It seems like the hiring manager just changed his mind on the status of the job without communicating to anyone . Definitely not very professional (at least not the JNJ style I was used to work for).                                                                                                 disappointed...
"The follow up is nonexistent. If we fill out the application and apply at minimum, J&J should send a form rejection letter.  I assume from the survey I did not get an interview or the opportunity to interview for role. I think there is a better way to communicate that. "
The first thing Johnson & Johnson can do is invite me for an interview.  Then I can rate the interview process. 
"The first recruiter I worked with was great, the second recruiter spent 20 minutes going over benefits of working for j&j with me, and then when the time came to make an offer, she told me that the position changed to a contract position and wouldn't include any benefits. The switch in recruiters early in the process leads me to believe it was known that this was a contract position long before I took a day off from my current job (at 35 weeks pregnant) for the in person interviews. The job scope change did not sit well with me."
"The first communication I received from Johnson & Johnson after acknowledging receipt of my application was this email survey-- which also was the first that I understood my application was viewed, considered, and rejected.  "
"The final interview felt like only as a polite call and not a real interest in the profile. I have to strech the fact, that I have fulfilled all requirements on the job description - what is beyond any usual JnJ requirements. 
I would advise, if you have a candidate pre-selected; dont let others to the  process because it is causing serious trust issues. Otherwise provide a feedback.
Greatest disappointment through the last years..."
"The feedback process of my interview was less than ideal.
The hiring manager didn't interview me, and, instead of taking the time to provide feedback to me, she e-mailed the feedback to my Manager who was put in a very difficult position. 
This was very poorly handled. In addition, I was told the business case I presented was in thousands when it should have been in millions. The business case provided to me was in thousands. This shows to me that the interviewer was not prepared. Not to mention the body language. After being in this organization for many years, I am very disappointed of how this interview and feedback was handled. "
the feedback is needed on why I was not a fit
The feedback from the recruiter or interviewer when you are not selected for a position is very important because we want to improve for a future interview
"The feedback early in the process was fantastic - very fast...but at the end there was just silence.  And I have asked for feedback and haven't received it, which is frustrating.  I like the company and felt that everyone was very professional.  Telling someone why they weren't chosen is hard, but it is helpful to the candidate to understand.  Sharing that feedback would make your process even better."
The fast application process through the Linkedin interface was much better than the one from the company website.
The fact that you rejected my application implies that your organization is something that does not have a proper philosophy to make right choices. I will not waste my valuable time for futile effort. God bless!
"The fact that Johnson and Johnson could not do a proper one on one phone interview, rather opting for an uncomfortable virtual interview, shows they lack communication skills and I am very happy i did not waste my time with additional interviews. "
"The fact that J&J requested I take this survey when I never heard a single word in response to my original application is indicative of the short-circuited state of the Company's recruitment process.
I never spoke to a human regarding my application. In fact, I would be stunned if human eyes even looked at my resume to determine the fit was not good enough to even justify human contact.
And this is not the first time J&J has reached out to me under the exact same set of circumstances. With these recruiting and HR policies, J&J is ruining its reputation with potential employees, and its larger overall brand as a Company. It's a great shame."
"The fact of the matter is that I can't recall hearing anything since my application was tendered on 3/21/17. This is a senior role, I would expect a little more communication, particularly from J&J-- especially when there are other large & small companies out there that are far more communicative and respectful of an applicants time. It really reflects poorly on a well-established company when the HR process is poorly organized.

Recommendations:
1) Keep the candidate informed
2) Actionable feedback upon rejection (e.g. you lack skill X, experience X, etc.)
3) An easily accessed job portal that one can log into to check status- updates

"The fact of not being contacted after the submission is understandable once the open position may have had hundreds of applicants. My understanding is that my personal qualification/salary/actual employment level for some reason did not indicates myself as a high potential for the position. I got an e-mail saying that I would not be considered for further steps in this process, which is completely acceptable. The system response indicates for me how highly qualified J&J is as a company and I will keep looking for further positions. Ires Silva (iresesilva@globo.com / +55 (19) 99314-5697)"
The experience was very smooth and pleasant. I have no recommendation for improvement.
"The employment Web site is, for the lack of a better term, ""broken"" and it's astounding that such a large company is either not aware of or is unable to remedy the problem."
"The employment form/process is long and
Ardous. Its not realistic to ask people to fill that out frlm the start. Ask for resume Nd
Them maybe one page on info."
"The employee's at the Lititz facility were very helpful and friendly to me during the process. I have never experienced this kind of treatment in other companies I have pursued employment. My only complaint would be that I wish they would have given the scores on the tests given for employment. Thank you, and keep up the good job your team is doing."
"The employee referral website could add basic search functionality (location, franchise, etc.)."
"The email which is sent out, should mention the position as candidates may have applied for a number of positions."
The email notifications about new jobs is NOT working. I have put in both work email and home email and I get nothing. It used to work so I not sure what happened lately. 
"The email informing me I did not receive the position for which I applied for stated ""Following your interview for the position..."" I was unsatisfied because I was never interviewed nor contacted by a recruiter for the Ethicon Sales position. "
The email I received just said I was not the chosen candidate.   It would be helpful if I had more feedback to see how I could improve on future interviews.
The email I received about my application did not explain why I was not being pursued. It only indicated that I was not being pursued.
"The email I got says, someone who has recently gone through our recruitment process.  I never heard a word from J&J.  Sending this survey to me does not make sense."
"The email came my way 3+ months after my application, and there was no ""person"" involved. Compared to other large companies that I applied at the same time, the response time and communication was sub-par. I am used to getting a quick response via email and phone, so after not hearing from the company for over a month, I pretty much cross the position off as ""lost."" I think it is hard for people to remain interested for a job this long while actively looking for a new job."
"The direct recruitment process online was satisfactory.  

However, subsequent to the job application this survey refers to, I applied for a more suitable position at J&J through a third party recruiter. 

I accepted a contract role – Safety Analyst, Horsham, PA -- extended to me on April 28. Unfortunately, due to weeks of this particular third party’s mishandling of the post-interview process, e.g. delayed and erroneous communication, as well as misinformation, the role that I so eagerly anticipated became unattainable.

I am using this forum to convey the need of a newly hired candidate to be able to communicate with Johnson & Johnson if/when a third party recruiter’s actions (or lack thereof) result in the loss of such a promising opportunity.

I remain extremely interested in the role that I accepted.  

Thank you for taking the time to read this."
The details on the position notice (add) did not mention the extended territory to cover. The interviewers never let me know what % of travelling there would be. I found out from someone outside the proccess. Maybe I would have withdrawn from the interview proccess if i had known.  
"The current computer screening process eliminates very viable people from the list of candidates a hiring manager has to choose from.  I think the process is so uniform so that recruiters aren't required to consider other potentially qualified individuals.  The focus in hiring should be more on the aptitude, past performance, the character of a candidate and their education.  Are we kidding ourselves to believe the best candidate is the one with the MBA versus the one who has stellar proven performance.  The screening is certainly the safe way to hire people, but it will certainly not move talent in and up. J&J thinks it is being fair but it is actually discriminating by discounting people who have suitable merit and talent, but do not fit a set of criteria.  Good people are sitting still while hiring managers are not presented with talent.  I oftened wonder how in a company of this size, we were provided so few candidates for a role.  It has become clear to me that the process is creating this.  "
The complete process should become more transparent.
"The company should, a a minimum, issue a standard form letter to unsuccessful applicants. Otherwise, the applicant is left in a vacuum, without comfortable freedom of action is seeking alternative employment.

The company needs to have a fair recruitment process to open the opportunities besides the already selected internal candidate.
"The company holds the decision and can do as they see fit on recruiting, interviewing, and hiring personnel.  Managers understands their ecosystem and should know know if a candidate has the experience to draw their attention. I don't know the entire process to make a recommendation at this time."
The communucation was a standard email message so I don't know if it was a recruiter or the system
"The communication was from a form letter, and very impersonal.  "
The communication is the major gap in the recruitment process. 
"The communication and I felt age discriminated against to be honest. The job requirement was exactly what I do and have been for many years.. not a call, not a reply."
The communicated (by std email only) reason for refusal was absolute crap.

"The application was cluttery and terrible relative to a lot of other ones I have filled out. The response letters seemed very generic and impersonal. When I attempted to reach out to them, I got no response. 

The entire experience was very crappy for a company of this magnitude. It seems the HR team only cares about it los own self-preservation and doesn't seem to care about the user experience through out the process. "
"The application questions are typically either very generic, or so detailed they are almost unrelated to what is described in the requirements.  When the automated 'rejections' are sent, they are not timely and have no indication as to rationale for non-consideration, other than another candidate more closely matches the qualifications. 

For the most part, the hiring process at JNJ is much like a 'big black hole', which is hard to believe for such a great organization. If fortunate to be selected for an interview, the interview process and working directly with a recruiting contact, works well.  AFTER the interview, unless the hiring manager themselves replies, there is typically no follow-up from the recruiting team.

The application process was very easy. I recieved the rejection email in a timely manner. No improvements needed at the time. 
The application process was very easy. I never heard from a recruiter or anyone after applying.
The application process is lengthy and time consuming.  The rejection emails do not explain why I was not considered for the job
"The application process at J&J is the worst. Its bloated, ineffective and out-of-touch. PR, appearance and the presumption of being interested in candidates is more important than actual reviewing, understanding and making changes to its hiring practices to be more inclusive. You are missing some very good people. As an example, I have 17 years of global sales and marketing experience in healthcare with an MBA and chairman of a non-profit community out-reach program in eye care working with Wills Eye and Temple Medical. I applied, by conservative estimates, over 187 times in 10 years. I never received any consideration much less a phone call or interview. I conduct recruiting, hiring and on-boarding for small businesses and can say without equivocation, your system is broken.  
Two month's ago I wrote a letter to Ashley McEvoy expressing my views with suggestions that would help J&J. What do you think happened? Not a single word confirming receipt. Geez, considering how I am treated as a non-employee why would I think J&J is a great place to work? "
"The applicant should know the reasons for the acceptance or rejection of the application. However, I know this is not possible for each applicant, but Johnson & Johnson should give some comments if the applicant got rejected due to some minor reasons. In my opinion, the applicant could improve himself/herself for future recruitment in Johnson & Johnson. "
"The announcement I applied to was subsequently cancelled, so I can't really comment on this."
The above questions indicated there was an interview or contact by the recruiter.  There was not.  I am a recently displaced employee that really liked my work and JNJ and would happily come back.
The ability to upload files as PDFs would be much improved to having to add text.
"The ""lack of fitness"" email came across as dismissive and superficial.
A clarification of the mismatching elements between the position and the applicant's credentials would go a long way in demonstrating J&J's class. 
A phone interview would - I believe - benefit J&J in unearthing good candidates.

Thank you for putting the survey together. I wish you and J&J the best."
"that i really don't know...
i haven't been asked to talk to anyone.."
Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback. The recruitment proceed is very slow so it will be great to get regular  communication status fir the applicants and finally when the decision is made. As a developing opportunity the applicants would like to know the learnings of the process. 
Thanks for the notification; and congratulations for the decision choosing Shared Service to be located at Bogota DC
Thanks for reviewing my resume.
Thanks for having my views 
"Thanks for asking for the feedback. 

Three feedbacks:

1. In today's world, resumes are not true representation of talent. Adding a technical questionnaire to the application process that would help you filter the good candidates and reduces or eliminate any doubts/prejudice/biases. Its unfortunate that I didn't get a call from J&J team to demonstrate what I have to offer, but having a better process would help hiring manager to understand all the applicants.

2.  Also visa sponsorship question that is currently in almost all employers is ambiguous and every recruiter and also applicants have different understanding of sponsorship. In, SAP HCM expert and I work different HRs and recruiters, everyone has a different understanding of that question.  Changing the verbiage would help.

3. Overall, applicant registration process was smooth.

Thanks for asking feedback for a dream system!
"Thank you, the process of the online application was fairly easy. Unfortunately I don't beleive my resume was even read and received a quick response of rejection.
I've been groomed to be a corporate machine by Pershing & Co. since the age of 18. The company sent me to NYU where I've taken every business course NYU offers to obtain a Masters in business. I didn't take any core courses hence no degree. I worked my way up the corporate ladder to manage an institutional trading operation on the NY Stock Exchange where we captured 10% of NYSE volume. I am a very talented trader and would be an asset to any organization. When I was hired Pershing &Co asked to help build a company, I was #89 in 1980 and when downsized in 2002 it had grown to 5500 employees. I am a team player and enjoy all aspects of trading. 
I highly respect the company of Johnson & Johnson and the way it is managed and would be greatful if your organization would reconsider me.

"Thank you so very much for reaching out to me, and asking me these questions. 

As a former J&J employee, I would have appreciated the opportunity to have a phone screen and/or receive more specific information as to why my candidacy was not pursued further. I had a wonderful experience working for J&J in the past. It is my impression that the company has changed since I left, and I certainly know I have grown personally and professionally. I truly thought I was a good fit for the particular job I applied for (EHS&S Manager 000016NT). I cannot imagine there will be any other employment opportunities with J&J that would have been as good a fit.

Thank you for the opportunity to fill out this survey.  I have submitted several resumes to J&J and have never heard from a recruiter except for a automated email.  I was with Baxter Health close to 17 years having several sales positions and a great successful diverse back ground.  Would have like to know what my back ground was lacking.  
Thank you for the opportunity and this feed back. 
"Thank you for the automated emails telling me that I was under review, then it was chosen to not pursue my candidacy.  I really think that there have been improvements made in the process by allowing candidates to track the progress; however, I think that even an email letting the candidate know why they were not selected - specifics for what would be needed to achieve a successful candidacy including interview and feedback for internal applicants would allow the candidates know what extra skills or experiences would allow them to succeed in future endeavors for the positions applied for which would inspire people like me to work on building those skills for the next time an opportunity such as this would be beneficial.  
Also, the new My Next Step should allow internal employees to search by location in order to find jobs in their area without having to search through hundreds of positions, similar to the search functions found in the old ""my career opportunity"" sections.  
Again, I strongly encourage J&J to focus on educating and promoting associates already in the company as they have knowledge that takes outside hires longer to make strong decisions (even up to a year before they are knowledgeable enough on the internal processes and operating systems required to make sound decisions which address the issues that arise in the most beneficial way to the company as a whole.)  I read recently that J&J promotes approximately 30% of internal applicants.  I agree that companies need a diverse work force and new employees bring new ideas and observe opportunities for improvement often missed by internal associates that can overlook items as they grow accustomed to them.  I also believe that hiring management level employees from outside is not always the best for the company because they don't have the internal knowledge needed to provide leadership depending on the role.  I suggest hiring outside employees at a lower level and having them learn and advance with time, and educating the most knowledgeable and committed internal employees in order to place them in upper positions as they are familiar enough with our past, present, and often have great solutions which make sense and add value.
I am sincerely trying to better myself and find a way to progress to the next level but the interviews I have had internally have provided feedback that I am overqualified, yet I make less money than the employees selected and have not had an opportunity to advance with the knowledge I have worked hard to learn in order to be a well informed candidate for many positions.  
Finally, it seems that internally as positions are posted, often the employee has already been chosen to fill the new role.  It seems interviews are mere formalities.  I actually received feedback that the recruiter felt I was the best fit with the best qualifications for a job for which I had applied, yet my feedback stated that they did not see what the recruiter saw in me and while my interview was good, I did not adhere as strictly to the STAR format as they felt was necessary when answering questions.  I feel stuck in my role and even demoted and I have no way to address this despite 5 years of complete immersion and learning skills I felt would benefit the company including complete dedication and commitment to my job role.

Asian job seekers face disadvantage even when they have higher degrees, study finds

A new Canadian study found job applicants with Asian names and a master’s degree got fewer interview requests than counterparts with Anglo-Canadian names and only a bachelor’s degree.
By Nicholas KeungImmigration reporter
Wed., Jan. 25, 2017

Job candidates with Asian names and Canadian qualifications are less likely to be called for interviews than their counterparts with Anglo-Canadian names even when they have a better education, a new study has found.

Using data from a recent large-scale Canadian employment study that examined interview callback rates for resumés with Asian and Anglo names, researchers found Asian-named applicants consistently received fewer calls regardless of the size of the companies involved.

Although a master’s degree can improve Asian candidates’ chances of being called, it does not close the gap and their prospects don’t even measure up to those of Anglo applicants with undergraduate qualifications.

Compared to applicants with Anglo names, Asian-named applicants with all-Canadian qualifications had 20.1 per cent fewer calls from organizations with 500 or more employees, and 39.4 per cent and 37.1 per cent fewer calls, respectively, from medium-sized and small employers.

“The disadvantage of an Asian name is less in the large organizations, although it has not disappeared,” said the joint study by the University of Toronto and Ryerson University, titled “Do Large Employers Treat Racial Minorities More Fairly?” It will be released Wednesday at a forum at U of T’s Munk School of Global Affairs.

The challenge, the report said, is that more than 70 per cent of private sector employees in Canada work for companies with fewer than 100 employees.

Paul Nguyen, 36, who was born in Canada to Vietnamese parents, said he was not surprised by the findings, as he has seen first-hand how a visible minority colleague with a doctoral degree was passed over for promotion in favour of a Caucasian with a bachelor’s degree.

In fact, Nguyen’s parents decided to change his name to Paul when he was in Grade 8 because his original name, Phuong, was frequently misspelled or mispronounced.

“It just makes it easier for me to navigate in the system,” he said.

The new study follows earlier research led by University of Toronto economics professor Phil Oreopoulos, who found that for every 100 calls received by applicants with Anglo names, applicants with Asian names got only 72. However, his study did not break down company size and occupational skill level.

The applicants in the study had fictitious names that were English (Greg Johnson and Emily Brown), Chinese (Lei Li and Xuiying Zhang), Indian (Samir Sharma and Tara Singh) and Pakistani (Ali Saeed and Hina Chaudhry).

Researchers in the current study further dissected Oreopoulos’s data, which was collected from a field audit that involved sending 12,910 invented resumés to employers for 3,225 real job postings.

Using a standard occupational status scale, researchers classified the job postings into high-skill positions such as accountant, civil engineer or sales and marketing manager; average-skill jobs such as financial adviser and claims adjuster; and lower-skill jobs that included bookkeeper, accounts payable clerk, restaurant manager or cashier.

While the study found the extent of discrimination against Asian-named applicants with all Canadian qualifications was roughly the same for both high-skill and lower-skill jobs (32.9 per cent less likely to get a call versus 30.7 per cent), skill level mattered much more when the Asian-named candidates have some foreign qualifications.

Whereas the Asian-named applicants overall had about a 53.3-per-cent lower chance of getting a call for an interview if they had some foreign qualifications, this rate rose to 58.5 per cent for applicants to high-skill jobs, and fell to 45.7 per cent if the openings were for lower-skill jobs.

“The less favourable response to Asian-named and foreign-qualified applicants at higher skill levels may arise because in those jobs, more is at stake in the credential assessment, so avoiding the issue by not calling is seen as the safer option,” said the study.

Researchers went one step further by looking at how Asian-named applicants with higher levels of qualifications fared compared to Anglo-named candidates with lower qualifications.

For Anglo applicants citing a master’s degree in resumés, the study found, the chance of an interview improved from 69.9 per cent to 81 per cent, or 11.1 percentage points — about the same percentage point increase as for their Asian counterparts (from 45.9 per cent to 56.5 per cent).

Although the positive effect of the extra education was notable, it was not enough to offset the overall disadvantage of having an Asian name. The callback rate for Anglo applicants without the additional degree was still 13.4 percentage points higher than for their Asian counterparts with the additional degree (69.9 per cent versus 56.5 per cent).

Jeffrey Reitz, a co-author of the current study and sociology professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs, said the findings call for the adoption of what’s known as an “anonymized resumé review” process — coding candidates without identifying their names — by Canadian employers.

“Some people are concerned this is something we are doing to accommodate minorities, giving an advantage to minority people by deferring to them,” said Reitz. “But no matter what political correctness is doing, it is not offsetting the problems.”

Blind recruitment can have a huge impact on eliminating some of the employers’ biases, as in the case of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra when it began auditioning musicians behind a screen in 1980, according to a CBC report. The orchestra today is almost half female and more diverse than in the 1970s, when it was dominated by white men.

Rupa Banerjee, another co-author of the paper and a professor at Ryerson University’s Ted Rogers School of Management, said she is not aware of any Canadian employers using blind recruitment practices.

Legislation such as employment equity measures will not eliminate name discrimination, which can only be addressed through education and training of hiring managers, she said.

“A name matters because it draws on implicit response and activates stereotypes on what a job candidate would be when you only have less than seven seconds to look at a resumé. People judge by the name they see,” said Banerjee.

“Anonymized resumé reviews can’t eliminate discrimination completely. That’s just the initial hurdle. When you go into an interview, you can’t hide who you are and remove your ethnic markers.”"

"Talent Acquisition Specialist should observe professionalism in contacting applicants, and email correspondence should not begin with ""Hi"".  A basic formal greeting of ""Dear Mr"" or ""Dear Ms"" is more business appropriate. Talent Acqusition Specialist should provide timely updates to applicants as to what exact stage the recruitment process is going, so that the applicant is not left in the dark stuck in the guessing game.  Applicant should not have to follow up after the initial interview if and when the personal interview will take place.  The administrator conducting the personal interview must advise applicant to expect insufficient parking for guests, especially if the applicant's first question at the first point of contact was availability of guest parking, and offer the option of public parking spaces most convenient to place of interview.  Not providing accurate information already puts the candidate at an unfair huge disadvantage, even before the actual personal interview has started. Talent Acqusition Specialist and Administrator must coordinate to ensure that the candidate applied for the correct position for which the personal interview was being conducted, and not to be advised on the day of the personal interview itself that the position which the applicant applied for has already been filled but was being considered for another position within the department.

How is that working out now? From what I heard things are not moving along. If I were in that position J&J would not be looking to hire contractors to help, just saying. Please know that I am not upset at all that J&J took a pass on me and I do wish the best for J&J. Again, take a look at my resume. I am back to work now and will continue to contribute 110% because that is what I do.    "

Hire a personable recruiter to contact candidates over the phone and screen them. It may be a good idea for the recruiter to speak with the hiring manager first to get a feel for expectations and the like. 

The current process, which seems to rely heavily digital screening, is very impersonal and gives the impression that J&J does not invest in human capital. In other words, ""come here if you don't wish to develop you're career"", ""this is a great place to stagnate professionally, then die."" 

The recruiting process, or lack thereof as it currently presents, has been a total disappointment. My advice to J&J would be to go on Glass Door, see which companies receive good reviews for recruiting, and take some notes. ""Crowd source"", because right now J&J does an absolutely terrible job at recruiting."
"Start the interview process with an actual person, whether on the phone or in person.  The web cam interview with a video screen does not allow for back and forth communication.

"Some sort of feedback would be helpful.  I know this is tough with the amount of applicants you have, but hear me out as a way to automate it.

1) For each job description, have the candidate fill out multiple choice questions with requirements and preferences from the job description 
2a) Go through your regular resume screening process
2b) Create a easy If/Then, True/False logic that would automatically align the candidates' answers against the ideal job description/requirements.
3) If you choose not to interview them then send out an email detailing the contrast from the logic.  Each logic would have a specific human generated response.
4) Include a test in the application process that would be math, verbal, situational questions and show them the mean, what your range is and where they are at.  Show them a legal, abbreviated for of the results vice what that particular positions best suited needs are.

At the end of the day this system is meant to automate repetitive tasks, but NOT screen out applicants.  If the candidate is a perfect match, there truly no reason for at least a 15-20min phone screen.  If the Candidate is not a perfect match, you can see still consider them, but when they are out, you have a documented reason why. 

Additionally, I think that you can use this data and process to: 
-build a better and critically thought out job description
-see the personality types and intellect of the people applying for you jobs (are you recruiting in the right places)
-see the experience of people by position that are applying (are you recruiting in the right place)
-if the tests are set-up correctly used throughout the employees term, see how people are evolving while in your organization and guage those test scores against existing positions in the organization.

"Some sort of correspondence from the recruiting team, other than a generic ""received your application"" notification.
"
Some sort of communication should be sent to all applicants whether they are being considered for the position applied for or not.
"Some recruiters are better than others, but the importance is making sure you have closed the loop for all candidates; i.e. providing clear feedback and direction - where they are in the process, what the next step is, why they have not received feedback yet, why they were not considered, etc. I have interviewed for positions where I never receive verbal or written notification that I did not get the job offer. I contacted the recruiter a number of times and was told I should contact the interviewer instead of the recruiter. That should be the recruiters responsibility to make sure the process has closer, not the person being interviewed."
Some questions are too specific. It does not allow for motivated people to learn new skills. It appears you only want a specific previous skill set. All that does is to continually circulate individuals from pharmaceutical company to pharmaceutical company. 
"Some of these questions do not apply to me since I applied for an internal position withing Medical Affairs and I am and continue to be a member of the Medical Affairs team. I think some of these questions are more appropriate for an external candidate regarding the interation with the recruiter.
I am and continue to be apreciative to be a member of J&J.

"Some level of personal interaction, especially for a senior executive posting, should be de minimus.

"Sofia Panzero lead a very transparent and clear recruitment process with me. 
I always received an answer from her in the following up process I did.

Sadly my profile was not fitting within the position level you were offering but I hope to keep participating in future opportunities "
"so it sounds like I did not follow the formal process especially for this position. I did not talk to a recruiter or HR really. I understand from the hiring manager that my resume came to him late in the game, he liked my background so he contacted me directly and we set up a meeting directly after we spoke on the phone. I was towards the end of my interviewing process with another company so he needed to make an evaluation quickly. I understood my background and salary were a bit higher than the position called for and he was going to consult with his leader to see if there was flexibility. I did not really hear back from him after I let him know my other offer came in quicker than expected. I know he was very busy so it is not a big deal. I also needed a bit more flexibility in terms of partial work from home which did not seem like a fit for his need. I wished him and I wish you all best of luck in filling the position if you have not done so already.
I think this is for the strategic customer group CV-- that is the one I am referring to just in case it is not- I have gotten several of these"
"So I was a referral from a current employee and I had a ""phone screen"". At the end of the conversation the recruiter asked if I had questions and I asked where are you in the process what are the next steps and she said we are hiring someone next week. So basically I was made to feel like she was just doing this phone screen because I was referred but I wasn't actually being considered despite by 17 years of successful sales experience in pharma.  I have since found a different opportunity with another company but that left an unprofessional impression on me in regards to the recruiting process at J&J compared to the other pharmaceutical companies I had been interviewing with. "
So I guess I didn't get the job?
"So far my experience has been very positive.  When I get the notice that I am not a fit, although it would be nice to get feedback and to why, I do understand the 100's of applications that are received for a particular position.  I am right now in the running for another position, and the recruitment process has been fantastic so far."
So far I see no need for improvements.
"So far all the responses I have received are automately generated, with no particular title or names to be addressed. The applicant is completely left out with any human interaction in the application process. It will be helpful if someone can reach out to the applicant to talk about the job content, even if he/she might not be the perfect fit. It is hard for the applicant to feel that the J&J team is serious about hiring someone, which is exactly the kind of atmosphere that the HR should focus on changing. "

"Since you didn't tell me the recruitment process, I can't tell you anything."
Since this survey seems to be the chosen form of notice perhaps it should state rather than merely imply that the candidate was not selected.
"since neither the recruiter or interviewer contacted me, don't you think you should check that fact before you send out your survey?"
Since I have worked as a contractor at JNJ I wonder why I haven't been selected to work again at JNJ. I would have liked to work either part time or even full time.
"Since I have not been contacted by Johnson & Johnson for any reason except to fill out this survey, it would be helpful if prospective employees would get at least a courtesy of a feedback after they go through a lengthy application process."
"Since any application process is tedious by nature, I would recommend to any employer that they avoid requiring the candidate to re-type information that is already contained in a resume.  Recognizing that larger employers receiving a high volume of applicants, such as J&J, need a consistent format of candidate data in order to expedite reviews, it would be courteous in those instances for the employers to identify disqualifying features from the outset (e.g., lack of specific licenses, experiences, etc.). That would spare unnecessarily lost time and effort on the part of both employer and candidate. Remember, many of the applicants are managing full time jobs so completing an application process occurs (or should occur) during non-work hours. For those wishing to provide thoughtful responses this is a time-consuming process.  Letting candidates know of non-negotiable, baseline hiring requirements would be extremely helpful and appreciated. Thanks for opportunity to submit feedback. "

(I should note that I had applied for a different position previously and did receive an automated notice in that case, so I am not sure why this would not be the norm for all positions.)  It is understandable that HR does not have the time to individually reply to each person who applied for a position, but at least some notification that a position is closed would be nice.  "
Send why is not a good fit
Send updates in a respectable timely manner about the position.

Resumes only give a brief perspective of the candidate. Interviews can provide so much more info. Perhaps at least a phone interview for a couple of minutes is something that should be considered more often.
Resume or biodata needs to consider for other opening s of rejected candidates for applied position . This helps to get best candidate for best position.
Restructuring impacted the position.  It was an unfortunate situation but the KAM new orleans position was collapsed.  Dissapointing overall to go through the entire interview process and have that happen.

Change Website companies for the application process.  Website design is  the worst I have seen in all my recruitment as well as my normal website visiting.  The search capability for instance - the ability to select location requires selection of continent, then country, then state, then city.  There is a technology called AJAX that allows you to start typing a city name in a box and it returns possible values as you type.  Most of us know how to correctly speel our own city names, or the names of the location where we want a job. 

As a good typist, it still takes considerable time to complete this application.

What really sets J&J apart is the lack of a response, whether positive or negative."

Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback. "
"Rejection e-mails are auto-sent only months, sometimes a year, after the position is posted. No company is worth waiting a year for. J&J's recruitment process being so mired in bureaucracy is surely an indicator of how monolithic its corporate culture must be. I'm willing to take my talent elsewhere."
Reinforcement Training
"Regular (maybe monthly) status updates on the recruitment process for a position.  Updates can be as simple as: seeking candidates, reviewing applications, interviewing, position filled, position on hold, etc.  My application was active for quite a long time (10 months), and I still had an interest in the role, but didn't have any way to know the status.  I ended up taking another offer before learning that the position had been canceled.

It would also be helpful to have a hiring manager or recruiter contact for any job postings.  While it is understandable that recruiters might get excessive messages, it would help to be able to get more information about a position before applying in order to save time for both the applicant and the recruiter."
regardless of your talent most manager just look at the name and they won't even consider you because they're looking for John Smith force managers to consider diversity
"Regarding the question: ""Did the recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to?""

I was not aware that I had been rejected from the position. This survey is the only notification I have received. There is no question here about my rating of the recruitment process, but I feel that learning the results of my application through a survey negatively reflects on the recruitment process."
"Referring to your above question which asks, did the recruiter contact you to provide a reason why you were not a good fit.  I was only told, the company was not pursuing my candidacy; but went on to say:  ""We encourage you to continue to review the job openings posted on our careers web site at Careers.""  There would be no reason I would want to continue to seek employment with your company if I was not told the reason(s) for being eliminated."
"Refer jobs to me that are more aligned with my background and experience. I for one am tired of applying for positions just to be rejected 100% of the time. Johnson & Johnson has a large presence in my area, and I would like to be part of it."
Reduce time to review and comment applications.  Actually contact applicants to inform them of real reasons they were not selected for interview and reduce that time it takes to contact applicants.  It takes J&J far too much time to contact applicants.  Applicants at left waiting in the wings to hear nothing from the company.
"Reduce the time between interviews (phone and in person)., include a reason why the candidate was not selected. This was my email from J&J - We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Senior Process Engineer)"
Reduce the response time between job application and first feedback from 3 months to a few days
"Reduce the overall time it take to recruit... Currently, it is about 3 months... "
"Reduce the number of questions required when initially applying -- it was pretty laborious. A quicker response would be appreciated. The best companies I have dealt with do respond faster. 

And while my opinion is of course biased, I am surprised that there was no contact from recruiting or screening of any kind. I applied online for a role that matches my skill set and experience rather directly, and there was no contact for 6 weeks, until I received an automated email saying I was not selected. 

On the positive side, I appreciated the email. Not every company does that. "
"Reduce the number of clicks to completing an initial application. However, overall, your online application does not inappropriately waste a job seekers time.   "
Reduce the amount of wait time during the application processes and denial or acceptance.

Recrutier involovment for positions at all levels and timely feedback.
recruter did not call me
Recruitment should not be limited to only the specific countries with vacancies but should be open to all other nationalities. That way the company will be able to promote diversity of ideas.
Recruitment process was not open and did not really provide a balanced approach.  The Taleo and referral system leave a lot to be desired as well as HR staff ability or dedication to resolving know issues.
Recruitment process was as expected.
"Recruitment process through internet and requirements appear to be restricted by policy requiring Bachelor's degree.  When I went to College they didn't offer progressive, competent IT Degrees.  I went to a speciality school, Chubb and at that time, Chubb Institute candidates where considered superior to college grads in the IT field.  For some reason today, existing recruiters do not seem to understand or respect that and go strictly by guidelines requiring Degree from college. I spoke with a friend in HR at J&J, whom advised me that's just the way it is.  Its unfortunate as most of the richest people in the world never completed college or took alternate routes.  J&J may be missing out by using automated tools, ironically developed by IT people to limit the applicants. Just some things to thing about.  Feel free to reachout and discuss. Michael Wizemann 732-718-9206 mwizemann@verizon.net. "
"Recruitment process needs to be more transparent and honest. If there's a strong lead candidate, you should not open the process and invite people to participate just to have a strong pool of candidates. I had interview slots of 30 minutes and often the interviewer was late, leaving us 15 minutes or less, it was quite disrespectful actually."
Recruitment process needs a lot of improvement. Feedback is very rare.for internal employees outside of the typical rejection letter.
"recruitment process is worse
improve communication,
way to view the interview process
value all potential Candidates 
Invite Candidate to join JnJ community
Help candidate improve their skills for future position"
Recruitment process is very slow and the application process is very tedious and not at all user friendly 
"Recruitment process is very impersonal.
I have tried several times to apply for positions and never heard back from a live person. I am not even sure if I am actually being reviewed, or if the computer generated emails are being sent by a live person.
I am a senior level professional pharma leader with 30 years experience, and find this to be discouraging from a company such as JnJ"
"recruitment process is too long, I've moved on when I received the generic email ""you were not selected, please join our talent pool....."""
Recruitment process is horrid.  Not only did I hear NOTHING from the process everyone I refer in also hear NOTHING.
Recruitment process is fine.
Recruitment process appears to have many oportunities to improve in whole process. Appears low commitment with integrity to give equal opportunities to all candidates.
Recruitment based on fact and not feelings.
"Recruitment at J&J now is an automated joke.  As a 7 year employee of J&J, I have a loyalty to the company.  10 years after leaving the company I have returned to a geography that would allow me to work for the company again. I have applied to several open positions.  In several cases, after months of hearing nothing, I have received an automated response that 'due to changing business situations, the position is no longer open'.  In another, I was given an automated response that they were looking at more qualified candidates - which is ironic because the position I applied for was the position I had in the middle of my career with J&J.
At no time was I contacted by anyone at J&J.  Half of the time there was never a response at all.  Seems logical now that so many positions at my former company are unfilled, or filled by non-qualified applicants that leave soon after (which I know based on the discussions I have had with former colleagues that I am still in close contact with).  Very sad."
Recruitment and hiring is a very personal thing. You should try having people involved in the process rather than just relying on software. 
Recruiting should be about a relationship and not a program which filters resumes online.   Suggest at a minimum a call to the candidate to show J&J's sincere interest in recruiting the right person.
"Recruiting process takes too long. It is the longest one I have ever experienced, with little to no communication while you are waiting."
"Recruiting process for J&J is very archaic.  The software system utilized is probably not working, and recruiters are probably not as experienced or educated as those they are interviewing...or not interviewing.  This system is an awful system!"

on a timely manner. This would help to increase the productivity of the company, so that both will get benefited."
"Recruiting / hiring is a black box.  I have no idea how matters are evaluated.  I have zero feedback.  I have never heard from recruiting staff re: application, despite working on site as a contractor for two years in positions of increasing responsibility.

Since J&J recruiting is entirely opaque, I'm unable to offer specific recommendations other than 'allow applicants some information'."

Recruiters seem to be not effective in identifying proven candidates. A quick short phone interview would help identify likely candidates instead of filtering them out.
recruiters need to tell applicants as soon as possible if they are not the right applicants not wait until 3 months later before sending out a generic rejection email.
Recruiters need to contact the person applying for the job to let the know why they weren't selected.
"Recruiters need to contact all applicants at a couple of points in the process:
1. To let them know their application/resume was received.
2. To let the candidate know what the outcome of the review is by either declining or setting up interview.

This would show a great deal of consideration and courtesy to applicants who have taken the interest and time to apply for positions at J&J. "
"Recruiters need to call if vacancy exists.Barring once 3 years back,I havent received any follow-up or calls.  Also,my id/password has been showing authentication failure ,does'nt seem to clear up. Any help will be appreciated."
"Recruiters do not reach out to internal candidates or keep them informed on their application process. It leaves internal candidates feel as though their career advancement is not appreciated, nor is the company invested in talent engagement. "
Recruiters could at least contact me with their feedback especially since I was a referral. Thank you. 
Recruiters can contact those applying for the positions.  I never received any contact from J&J regarding any of my submissions.
Recruiters can communicate more to let the potential employee be aware of why they were not the fit required at that point in time. It should be stated that that I got a letter stating that I was not selected but did not know why.
Recruiters are to be understanding the job description and applicants' resume better.
Recruiters are rude and do not care.
"Recruiter/HR manager needs to provide timely response to the candidate regarding status of the job application.

Note that some job applications have been open for months and there is no transparency with respect to being selected or the outcome."
"Recruiter was very impressed with my background and experience, and was impressed after the phone interview. I was told I would be contacted to set up an interview after the recruiter reviewed my information with the hiring manager, but I was never contacted regarding an interview, which is mind boggling considering my background and experience and feedback from the recruiter from our phone interview."
Recruiter was not familiar enough with investments to understand my qualifications and have a meaningful dialogue.  Given this disconnect I think a phone interview with the hiring manager would have made sense.  I feel my bacckground and qualifications for the position was a perfect match for the job description.  It was not explained to me why I wasn't given the opportunity to speak with a hiring manager.
Recruiter to contact. 
Recruiter should update candidates the stage of their application. 
recruiter should tell the reason for which the application has been rejected 
Recruiter should notify the candidates stage of application
Recruiter should follow up with candidates after interviews. I had to contact the hiring Manager directly.
"Recruiter should contact all candidate and give a feedback, HR talent recruiters are increasing mistrust in the company that from one side shows CREDO values and from the other ignore employees. I don ' t even think this feedback will be accounted for improving quality"
Recruiter should call and check if the candidate is eligible before not considering for role.  
Recruiter should always contact you to provide reason for not being selected. This allows the candidate a better understanding of areas he needs to improve in order to better prepare himself for future J & J job opportunities.

Recruiter interaction is non existent. Feedback is hit or miss.  This is the way it has been for 10 years. I never treat applicants like this. The problem is you are too big and have no best practices or SOP regarding this aspect of your recruitment process. I would bet your candidate experience surveys point this out as a consistent issue. Great company horrible candidate experience

"Receiving this survey was the only communication I received informing me that I will not be considered for the position applied. An e-mail from JnJ HR would have been appreciated. Also providing information as to job status within my profile on the careers site would also be helpful. 
Thank you for my employment consideration. "
"Receiving this survey implies I was contacted by a recruiter for an ititial assessment, but I was not contacted at all by anyone. My resume entered the black hole of death.... a clear sign you need to hire me as your process improvement manager!"
Receiving an e-mail to take a survey is how I found out I was not selected for the positions I applied to.  I do not find that an effective means of communication. 
Receiving a notification that the position was filled or the process still ongoing.
Received an email that my application was received the same day as the email that I was not being considered for the position.  And that was about 2 weeks after I saw the job re-posted.  Timing of emails seemed poorly performed. 
"received an email indicating position was on hold, so these questions are not worded to match this scenario"
Received an email about not being considered for this role.
"Received an email about not being considered for the position, so unable to answer questions about interview process."
"Received an automatic email, with a couple of hours, of applying.  Was this automated through you're recruitment portal?  The online application process seems to be completely controlled by your system (ie:  keywords) and not by people.  But you are hiring people, so I was very disappointed by that.  Overall you're system is just big business not the people business and I think because of that you might be loosing great candidates who can offer a lot to your company."
Receive timely feedback through emails or phone calls. For example i did not receive any feed back on my application 
Receive this trust for feedback. Yet I was not contacted for any part of the interview.

Receive a feedback on the reason for not reaching the interviews.
Reasonable quick feedback to the job seekers would help
Reasonable communication 
Realize that it us completely broken. Waited over 5 months before being informed about the decision. Never felt connected at all. 
"READ the resume, for starters."
Read the CV!  Using questionnaires solely to judge candidates are really robotic as well as if not organized properly will misguide.  For example a person with a PhD and 10 years industry experience is less than a person with a MS and 25 years experience.  This example is one of the many reasons why lead discovery in pharmaceutical companies have not measured up to their actual capabilities. 
"Read the cover letter a bit more thoroughly. As the son of an H.R. director (Chanel, Caldor, Hess, Fordham University) for 44 years I am aware that many in the role scan fast and discard many applications, but beyond being quite qualified, I made reference that I worked there before (and when  I was suddenly hospitalized and returned on a Friday---against medical wishes, I was cut upon leaving without cause.. I later reached out to my former supervisor, sent a long E-mail, only to get no response), but beyond having 14 years in customer service that made me very qualified for this role and having worked there before, though I am realistic that I am one of 221 that may have applied, as far as ""what can be done to improve the process"", instead of 'scanning & discarding' so quickly, take a closer look at who you're scanning and discarding and read their background and cover letter a bit closer as you're missing out on a highly skilled candidate with valuable experience."
"Read more carefully the resume, sometimes the person fit perfectly, but the recruiter don't see the highlights. Anyway one they would be my chance to work for J&J"
"Reachout in a timely manner, speak to applicant about their potential contributions and see how you can improve you services via a live contact."
"Reaching out to potential candidates would be ideal. Even if you as an employer chooses not to pursue a candidate, an automated email with such a declaration would be helpful. To date (5/16), I have simply participated in 2 of these surveys; I applied on march 13th. I have no idea whether or not I am currently under consideration for this position! So system alerts - at a minimum - would be helpful. Preferably, an HR representative would have made contact, and provided additional insight regarding next steps if any. Now, 2 months later, I can only assume that there is no interest. 
Thanks!"
Reaching out to candidates directly via LinkedIn based on prospective fit.
Reach out. I have not heard from anyone regarding the position. Candidates would like to know what is going on in the process.

Reach out to young candidates and let them know how we can improve our application.
Reach out to qualified candidates to ensure they have a fair opportunity in the hiring process
Reach out to qualified candidates for a conversation.  The process is very impersonal.
"Reach out to properly screen candidates before automatically disqualifying them. My resume was a very strong fit for the role and I was rejected in less than 24 hours. It is evident that this either the recruiter did not intend to hire anyone from the outside and already had a candidate identified, or didn't even take the time to properly peruse the resume. "

"Reach out and explain why the candidate wasn't considered, that's basic courtesy I reckon."
"Reach out and communicate to the candidates, rather than leaving them blind as to why they were not considered."
Rational for rejecting qualified prospects. Better communication (not just rejection email)
"Rather than sending general emails of rejection(not acceptance), I would appreciate a short concise email on the reason behind it. I duly understand it is not an easy job to write emails to every applicant, but doing so adds image to J&J as a caring company, which is also the worlds largest pharma."
"Rather than getting a form email saying I wasn't the right candidate for the job,  it would be nice to know why I wasn't.  It would also be nice to be contacted by a person.  I have an extensive background in Finance,  Commercial,  and Contracts (including all government contracts) across the board of branded,  generic and OTC pharmaceuticals,  and medical devices.  The way I was notified of not being a good fit, and the lack of anyone indicating where I would be further ahead focusing my search in such a large company,  is frustrating and disappointing. "

"Quicker feedback, recruiter actually talking to applicants"
quicker decision and better communications during the process to set expectations for the timing of the final decision
Quick and immediate contact 
"Put the ""personal"" back in the process.   Very little if any feedback, no in person interaction at all.   With primarily sales or sales management positions in particular, if you are relying on a resume only or ""piece of paper"", you are missing a huge HR advantage to finding and yielding the best talent at the beginning of the process.  Also, it appears actual resumes are not reviewed.  For example, with the little scrap of written feedback one may get in the denial process, it may say,  ""sorry we are looking for veteran"" and it says clearly right on the persons resume that they are in fact a veteran.  That is just a slap in the face.  "
Put more effort in the communications.
Put more clarity in the job title and description. I spoke with a few J&J employees who didn't understand what the jobs entailed after reading the title and description. 
"Put in job posting website/your own portal the pre requistes need to match that you need to have citizenship or green card and with h1b visa are not eligible.

Not satisfied with the way how you handled it. "
"Punctual, professional, kind. "
Published potential candidates scores by ranking working experience and education
"Providing timely updates at each stage of the interview process. 
I would like the recruiter or the hiring manager to explain the reason why I was not a good fit for the role as well."
Providing the reason why a candidate is not a good fit for the position he or she applied to is very important. It can help candidates applying for the positions fit them better in the future.
"Providing results of application and Timelines on when the results will be shared would really help candidates instead of applying and assuming the possibility of application may or may not be even looked at.

Providing reason why the position was not a good fit.
"Providing prospective candidates with updates on their applications would be considerate.

Providing feedback in a more timely manner when the recruiters decided that the position will not be filled and reason why. 
Providing feedback besides an email saying your application isn't being pursued would be appreciated. I was enthusiastic for the position and had the experience and education. 
Providing feedback as to why you were not considered would help candidates understand.
Providing feedback and suggesting alternative positions that are a better fit would be highly appreciated
"Providing feedback about the reason to not chose me. It would be a valuable information for my professional development.
Anyway, thanks for the opportunity.
Yvy"
Providing feed-back even if it's brief after each stage of the interview would be great and serve long way. I was interviewed over the phone b recruiter and after that never heard back. Thank you.
providing a reason why I were not a good fit
"Providing a reason on why a candidate has not been selected for a position, this will help in future application."
Providemore more timely and personal feedback
Provided with generic decline letter but did not have any contact with a recruiter to understand why declined from further progression as a candidate.  I liked that at least there was an email acknowledgement of next steps and in this case a decline of candidacy for the role.
"Provided a more thorough response as to why I may not be qualified for the position.

"Provide valuable feedback to applicant. Never got contacted by J&J recruiter while same position was presented by contract recruiting firms as a god match. However, contract recruiter can't represent the candidate once already applied on J&J website.

In reality of life, all hiring manager looking for exact match so no further investment needed in transition/ training. Once employee join the company, they found the candidate same as others and encourage to perform above/beyond  as well looking forward for out of the box ideas. Is it really makes sense? The outstanding candidates are never satisfied with one skill and they always looks for more...

"Provide updates. I did not realize there was a hiring freeze right after I interviewed since there was no feedback. 
I would have changed some things with my job search if I had known there was no chance of employment at Janssen (at the time)

Thank you! "
Provide updates.  I was not updated at all in the process at any stage.  I only received the generic email telling me i  was not being considered for the position.
provide updates- no updates were provided from hiring manager or recruiter despite multiple attempts to find out status of position after interviewing for four+hours. Very unprofessional! A simple email stating that another candidate was hired would have been nice.
"Provide updates to the applicants. People should receive some type of notice regarding their application, whether or not they were selected for an interview. If there was a specific reason they were not chosen, please provide."

provide timely feedback thru each phase of the hiring process.
provide timely feedback regarding where you  are in the process.  One should not have to send email after email or make 4 or 5 phone calls and never speak to someone only to receive an email six weeks later indicating your not moving on in the process.  Very Poor!
"Provide timely feedback after the rounds of interviews to keep candidate in the loop. I never received any input on how my 6 interviews went nor a quick call from the recruiter to follow up, I think this was unprofessional and kept me waiting for an answer for several weeks."

"Provide some feedback re selection, or non selection.
Also recommend types of positons that are more in line with skills and experience."
Provide some feedback on reasons why an applicant does not meet job descrition and requirements.

Provide some feedback about why I was not selected for the position applied.
Provide some feed back on why someone was found not fit for the role - specially for senior roles 
"Provide some element of feedback to candidates.  I realize that with so many job openings and so many applicants it is a difficult task, but it would be wonderful to tell those who did not make it through the initial selection process their status, so they do not have false hope."
Provide some communication either way if selected or not. I was an internal referral and never heard a word after I applied. I am assuming the position I applied for months ago has been filled. It is nice to hear thank you so much for applying but we went a different route.

Provide enough communication of the status of the interviews etc. I haven't yet heard back from an interview I attended several months back. Ironically I thought the interview went quite well!

"Provide earlier feedback on whether candidates are being considered for a role. 2-3 weeks max. Even if J&J uses applicant trackers rather than having hiring managers or HR review resumes, at least have it send a generic message to those that don't meet the needs of the role.

The funny thing is nearly seven years ago I had a phone interview with someone from HR and J&J and heard nothing until months later by which time I accepted a position with another company."

I received the email from Ms. Jasmine Miles on my bidding for ""Senior IT Manager, Regulatory Execution & Delivery PLO"" but I had to ask for details on why I was not considered.  In my opinion, this is very important as it helps the individual to prepare himself for future opportunities by reaching out to close those gaps.

After applying for several jobs where I thought I would be a perfect fit, and not even being considered for an interview, my enthusiasm for applying at J&J has dwindled, as I see this as a waste of time. I have to assume that J&J recruiters have in mind a variety of selection criteria, not just the professional fit. I find this ridiculous, as in my mind the best qualified should get the job. Thus, I am not even sure if I would want to work in an environment where professional qualifications are just one among other irrelevant (in my mind) criteria. "

Provide Better feedback!!

Provide a way to get feedback on why you were not a good candidate. I tried to contact to find out but there was no response to my e-mailed query.

Provide a valid reason / basis for short listing candidates.
"Provide a type of feedback that allow a candidate to have a more clear understanding of why he/she has not been considered.
Find the way to humanize the communication with candidates. Right now it feels very mechanized.
Can a new system be developed that helps with the hiring process?
Maybe the jobs can be posted along with a checklist that shows the weight of each requirement.
Then, have a mechanism in place that preselects some candidates more automatically 
Limit the amount of questions on the early stages, then incorporate the necessary question later in the process
For those candidates that made to the second, third and further cycles, have a more customized feedback
That way you can conform a pull of potential candidates, which you can revisit later on, without committing to employment until they pass all of the levels.

As a candidate, any person can easily figure out how much chances they have to be considered.

Please note, as far as I know, the process I just described doesn't exist, however since you asked for feedback, I'm trying to provide some usable feedback, beyond a simple complaint.

Thank you for asking.

Best,
Turian"
Process is Good.
Process is extremely impersonal and choppy with zero follow up.
"Process feel lacks a personal touch and seems more like a ""Robo-talent-recruiter"" where I only intetacted via a website and email and not a single time with a person. Even for positions where I was a good match. Job description lists preferred qualifications but then in the application process these are required to be responded to as yes or no leaving one to think these are used to automatically eliminate candidates. For example , trackwise or sap experience ....is irrelevant as these are just systems for capa investigations or enterprise systems. More important is its concept rather than knowledge of navigating through the software. In summary process has been automated to the point that candidates like myself feel discouraged to continue applying."
Probably send some updates on how the process is going and estimate a time frame for the hiring process to be complete.
Probably not rely on robots to offscreen resumes
"Probably my concern has not solution due to the overwhelming number of application you handled, but Its hard not to have the feeling that your apllication has been managed by a robot based on some blunt rules (that could oversee the true value of a candidate) and not by a keen trained human HHRR official.

- Improve communication with prospective employees even through the automated system
- Be prompt in response 
- Don't have listings open for several months or years
- Keep listings current"
"Prior to the video interview, I believe it would be beneficial to have a phone interview to better prepare the candidate for the video interview process. For someone who has never participated in a video interview, it is an interesting process to experience."
"Prior to send this kind of survey, a formal communication should be send to those employees that apply to any position, even though, candidate is not qualified for the position. "
Present more opportunity to contract employees who work with JBI counterparts. It would be very motivating knowing that I have a real chance of securing an opportunity with the company in which I sell & provide vital resources to HCPs to on Janssen Biotech's behalf. 
Preference to established and proven prospective candidates. 
Postings made more clear and accurate to the specifics of the position and what the recruiter is looking for.

post salary range for the jobs.....
Post real openings not positions that someone is being promoted into or a candidate is already identified for it.  This gives a false sense of opportunity.  I am tired of being told that I'm one of the three required intrerviewees and not a real candidate for the opening.
Post real openings not positions that someone is being promoted into or a candidate is already identified for it.  This gives a false sense of opportunity.  I am tired of being told that I'm one of the three required intrerviewees and not a real candidate for the opening.
"Post job openings online only if you genuinely believe this is where you will find talent to fill your positions. As a graduate fresh out of college with a 3.8 GPA in chemical engineering and plenty of internship experience, I expected to at least have some success with the job application process. I filled out 124 online job applications and only received 1 interview offer and it was for a business position, not engineering. 

I don't know what it is you (and most other companies) are looking for in your online applications, but I strongly believe it is not effective because I don't understand how so many talented individuals go unnoticed throughout the process. If I can get accepted into Stanford's graduate program of engineering and not receive a single interview applying to engineering positions, what does that say about your process? "
Post actual openings where no one has been identified for the position.  Posting jobs that the reporting manager has a candidate in mind for provides a false sense of opportunity.  I have been told on many occasions that a minimum of three candidates need to be interviewed and I'm just one of the required interviewees not a real candidate for the position.
"Possibly, consider seeking motivated professionals from the fields the products are targeted for. A candidate may not have proven experience in a sales territory, but the passion from an individual who uses, and knows how to position the product among their peers could be a great asset. "

"Poor Human Resources work.
My skills, qualifications and expirience were the perfect match to job requirement but did not even received call from HR to discuss position.
Not really sure what HR are basing their decisions.

Poor follow up and response for the application process and decision
Poor feedback when using LinkedIn or social media hiring process.... it could be better and more professional.

If they feel that the candidate is a hard worker, then some members in the group do micro-politics to avoid hiring. It happened to me with J&J.

"Please look in for the candidates who have been working for JnJ over years (directly on site or as vendors). I myself have applied for the positions at JnJ and having contributed 3 years of my life working on various projects for JnJ.

In my case, I was not contacted and had to repeatedly follow up with my recruiter over the course of a month and a half following my interview. Also, the management team's expectations for the role had a different focus than the job description. Please ensure that the job description aligns with the evaluating team's expectations."

"Please check your recruiters - someone is saying that they contacted candidates and they did not ... I NEVER had any contact with a J&J recruiter about this job, and yet I am asked to complete a survey about my contact and the interview process? Someone is lying somewhere! Evidently, like just about every other J&J job, the candidate was already identified and the recruiter is just going through the motions and saying they interviewed people. Please catch this type of dirty employee! In my 10+ years of former employment with J&J, I was burned too many times by this (we already identified someone, we didn't have to relocate the candidate we chose, etc. etc.). SHAME ON J&J."

"please ask references and speak with them. I prepared a strong interview with a PPT interview. I was recommanded by Janssen people, I worked 5 years at Janssen and got rewarded many times. At the end, one of the example I provided to the recruiters had them think that I was not a good collaborator a d that my attitude would have been deleterious with the reps. So disapointing...I was asked for a situation where relationship is not easy and honestly, I don' t have many examples, and I think I've been misjudged. Real collaborators could have testified my true attitude and provide good feedback (medical or specialty reps, managers, business unit directors, regulatory or legal Partners...). Please consider talking with candidates' ex colleagues to get a just picture. I could have considered providing a fictive story about a relationship that was not optimal but turned out as best buddies in the world. I chose honesty and my work was crowned with success, at the end of the issue I refered to in my example. It left a bad taste of the whole process. It won't alter my perception of the years I spent at Janssen, but I've been rejected twice since then by your interview process. Once as a specialty rep in gastro (2016): was told I was ""too passionate about medical education and that I would quit the company if I would receive an offer elsewhere"", then ""not a so good collaborator for a MEM role, it seems, based on a situation I was asked about (2017).  5 years at Janssen (2001-2007) then 2 of these interviews...

Personally reach out with a recruiter.
Personalized communication 
Personalized attention because a resume is only a review of  a candidate is.
Personalize your approach.  The electronic interface is very inpersonal and doesn't capture what potential clients have to offer J&J.

Personalize responses

"Personal feedback would be great. Also, technical support speaking directly with a person as opposed to online. "
personal feedback from recruiter would have been good. J&J can miss opportunities to get best talent without personal interaction. Talent cannot be judged by looking at one page resume. There will be a lot beyond resume. Talk to people to know them better!
Personal feedback
"Personal email, phone call, etc to explain why they were not chosen for an interview. Also to hold on to resume and make suggestions for other positions the applicant may be qualified for."
Personal contact would help.
Personal contact would be nice......
personal contact is always an improvement.
Personal contact from HR. Phone interview. Reasoning for getting/not getting an interview rather than the a simple go/no go style email.
Personal contact
Personal contact
"Personal Contact
Reply with feedback "
Personal communication would be my recommendation 
Personal call especially for those candidates that fit criteria. 
Person to person contact would be great. The automated responses are seriously delayed and are not personable.
"Perhaps this is just frustration from a candidate's perspective, but I have filled out more than 30 of these surveys, yet nothing changes, making it appear that these results are not being evaluated"
"Perhaps there can be dedicated staff tasked with just looking through all the applications in the initial phase to make sure none of the highly qualified ones are missed. For applicants, it would be great if we can simply upload a PDF resume and fill out a minimum number of forms. Also, maybe alerts can be automatically sent to applicants when their resume has been viewed, moved to the next step, or even when the job posting has closed and applications are no longer being accepted."
Perhaps send an email to potential applicants letting them know they didn't get the interview/position rather than finding out via a survey.
Perhaps reach out or call.
"Perhaps provide more feedback as to why a candidate is not a fit to continue the process, especially for more senior/executive roles which I have applied.

I have applied several times to J&J in Tampa, exceeded the listed qualifications, experience, and requirements... yet receive no contact other than an automated email rejection with no explanation.

Perhaps it is the distance from the facility, even though it is commutable &lt;50 miles and I have voluntarily applied with awareness to this distance?  No distance or ""time to report to facility"" requirement or expectation was listed in the job description?

I am very interested in J&J and feel that I would be an excellent senior level contributor based on my experiences, especially for the newer Tampa business, but wonder now after several attempts if I am being vetted out immediately due to my location?

"Perhaps only to share a little more details about the reasons why a candidate was not a good fit . Just saying thank you for your interest, is insufficient to me . I would like to know how I could become a good option for Johnson & Johnson."
Perhaps only send surveys to those actually invited to participate in the recruitment process as opposed to those who merely sent a rejection form letter. Its like salt in a wound.
Perhaps one simple thing is to revisit previous high quality candidates and try to reach out to them. They may be the stars the firm is looking for afterall.
Perhaps one simple thing is to revisit previous high quality candidates and try to reach out to them. They may be the stars the firm is looking for afterall.
"Perhaps more timely feedback, and only recruiting for open positions.
I eventually received notification that another candidate with better qualifications was selected, yet the same job appeared again on the job boards not too long after this notification."
Perhaps more human communication as opposed to system-generated emails.  I have applied for a couple of positions and the only response is to take the recruitment process survey.  I would rather have the feedback even if it does not support me obtaining a position.  
Perhaps have some HUMAN contact?
Perhaps focus on improvements to their system before asking for feedback. 
"Perhaps contact the person at least once after they have submitted their application, even with a generic email. "
Perhaps consider applicants for more than 2 minutes before rejecting them. I received a rejection e-mail roughly 5 minutes after submitting an application and checked off nearly all the boxes of stated requirements and preferences.
"Perhaps better review background and qualifications. With over a decade of measurable and verifiable success within medical device/biotech sales, in both territory management and regional sales management - leading a multi-disciplinary team to winning top region growth in North America four straight years - I would think I'd at least get a phone screening. To not consider my skill set and background relevant shows to me that it was probably not even looked at. I would have added great value to the J&J team, and had a high regard for the company, along with passion for the position. I understand that the candidate pool is strong; I've been in the position of hiring for similar positions before. I can't imagine a candidate with as solid of background as mine not at least receiving a phone screening, however. "
perhaps better communication with applicants
Perhaps an automated response that my qualifications did not meet your requirements.
Perhaps actually reviewing candidates resumes and experience would be a start.  
"Perhaps actual personal contact, Vs just an email"
"Perhaps a live person can contact me for an interview. This ridiculous process of having a computer rule out candidates is ridiculous. I have 20+ years of experience in project management. I'm hard pressed to understand why I don't meet your criteria 
Once again. A live person should call me"
"Perhaps a dashboard to know the application status whlith email notification.

Thanks"
Perhaps a bit more personalize reason on why they are not interested in the candidate for a position.
Perhaps a bit faster and a bit more clearer on to why someone did not get into the hiring process.
"People who are looking for job and have potential to do best, please give chance to them to work with you, at least give them volunteering opportunity. So they can get the opportunity to work with your esteemed organization and learn new skills.

"People take time out of busy schedules and invest emotional energy in applications.  A qualified resume with relevant experience deserves more than a form letter.  
A couple of years ago, I went through part of a phone interview process that went very positive and was told I would be moved along in the process and was never given any follow up.  If the recruiter says they have no reason not to move someone along.....move them along.
Another thing I would recommend is training recruiters to recognize transferable skill sets."
"People put a lot of effort and preparation in getting ready for the interview. As much as we really want the job, if it isn't meant to be, we as candidates need to accept that. Not getting any feedback, even when asking for the feedback, shows me lack of respect, professionalism and courtesy to the candidate. 

I know Johnson & Johnson is a great organization, but this process and not getting feedback from the hiring manager really left a bitter taste regarding whether J&J really is that great of company?"
"People contact is the most important aspect for recruiting.  Take away algorithms picking ideal candidates.  I have friends whom work for J&J and only have great things to say.

Thank you.

"People at HR never bother to contact or reply for the position applied for, sad"
Pease see previous response to the survey
Pay close attention to mycredentials. I've seen lesser competent people being hired by JJ. Not a fair process. You're neglecting very highly qualified people based on? Whatever!!!
Pay attention to the skilled and educated people. 
"Pay attention to people who apply, they actually could have been a missed opportunity for the company"
Pass on the best candidate for the job
"Overall, I think the talent platform is intuitive and easy to navigate. I think response rates could be improved to some extent but recognize that bandwidth and process likely dictate the timing from submission to response. 

"
"Overall, I believe J&J could improve the communication process after the initial phone screen if a candidate isn't going to move on to an in-person interview, as well as in getting back to the candidate to let them know they're not moving on, after an in-person interview.  "
"Overall, good process.  Easy to apply for specific job and appreciate followup.  "
Overall the system is fair and allows candidates to learn and move forward 
"Overall the feedback received was outstanding however they hire an external candidate with experience in the same role. I have less experience in the role but it represent a development opportunity, I can't compete with someone doing the job in a competitor. "
Overall it has been an enjoyable experience. 
Overall feedback
"Overall ,I am satisfied the whole process.I sent two e-mails to the recruiter,she responded promptly. 

It would be great that the recruiter can tell me the reasons that I was not qualified.But I didn't put expectation on this ,because in general, most of recruiters won't provide such information.

I would like to see if there are other positions which I suit for in the future. 

Thanks"
"Over the last year 6 months I have been getting jobs sent to my email, that are totally unrelated to my skill set. I think the word search terms need to be revised in the data base.

I would like to speak with a talent acquisition member , it would be nice to explore opportunities based on skill set with a live person. I am a former J&J employee."
Over communicate. 
"Out of the hundreds of times I applied for a position at J&J., very few times have I ever heard back for them.   By the law of averages, I should have been hired by them long ago.  I have applied many times over 10 years for positions where have 10+ years of experience in and exact match to my skill sets, industry tenure and therapeutic area expertise.  Never even got a request for a phone interview.    Nothing and no reply ever.   Applying there is a black hole."
"Out of any large pharmaceutical company I have looked at and/or worked for- J&J is by FAR the most responsive, comprehensive, and time-sensitive in getting back to potential candidates. 

Many large company's do not even respond to candidates who they are not interested in. Your team takes the time to personalize communications and offer networking opportunities for future openings.

 I honestly cannot think of one area that I would change regarding your recruitment process.....Except--I would suggest to perhaps consider me for an interview one of these days!! Just kidding :)

Thank you for having the decency to openly inform applicants if they do not possess what you are looking for. It is a rare company quality- especially for one of the biggest pharma companies in the world.  Job well done & have a nice night! "
"Other than this survey, no response has ever been received."
"Other than the original screening call, the recruiter did not contact me at all. The hiring manager contacted me directly regarding the interview scheduling.
I am actually going to reach out now to the recruiter due to the fact that I received this survey. Due to the questions asked, I am assuming that did not get the position, though no one has contacted me to confirm this."
"Other than the initial ""we got your application"" email, I have not received any communication from J&J. I'm hopeful that I am still being considered for positions.

J&J was a major customer at my previous employer and all of my interactions with J&J were extremely positive. Everyone J&J employee that I've ever spoken to has nothing but great things to say about your company and I hope I may one day have an opportunity to join your team."
"Other than hire me, I would like better and possibly more human follow up. The letters that I may not be considered for a role are often very cold and impersonal however the fact that you are offering this survey shows that you care for your potential and future employees."
"Other than an automated e-mail acknowledging my application, there was zero communication from J&J.  I didn't expect the process to keep me this much in the dark from a company I hold in such high regard.  
     Receiving this survey is the only feedback I have received, although my job-agent that I set up online has sent me notifications about other opportunities with your company.  
     I am particularly disappointed because I felt that I was an extremely strong fit for this position (Sr. Manager Customer Quality (182161104) at DePuy in Palm Beach Gardens, FL), as well as being a local candidate that would not require relocation assistance.   
     Please consider me for future openings, if your recruitment process keeps candidates' profiles on file.  
Thank you!

"Other companies do not give specific reasons to the candidate regarding the reason(s) for the rejection. But, they do give a list of reasons why the candidate was not selected - sometimes they will check off the reasons; sometimes they will leave it blank and let the candidate decipher the why. This is a much better method than simply saying there were ""other candidates who were more qualified"". For example, the reason the candidate may not have been selected, relative to another candidate, is that one candidate required relocation while the other did not yet they were both highly qualified for the position. Obviously, it is more cost-effective to hire the local candidate."
Other applications were not answered
Originally was not able to upload my resume ...so I had to put together a quick fix resume to submit.....
Open the communication channel. Especially for former employees who deserve a higher level of engagement from their former company than no response at all. 
Open position for US base personnel with no relocation alternative.  Consider in a positive way the years of service you already have with J&J.Obtain feed back on why you were not seleted.
"Open communication, not rely on automated  email responses. It make one feel that J&J is simply a machine."
Open communication and follow up 
Open communication about the hiring process and to provide status update. 
only two way communications with candidates is recommended
only send me a survey after a real contact 
"Only post positions that are truly available to all, i.e. where a candidate has not already been selected and the job is posted due to procedural requirements.   Ensure recruiters follow a standardized transparent process "
"Only advise use computers systems to do assessments but keep a balance, don't remove human in person meeting factor and read resumes as many times till you understand the person overall, resume can tell you, reading resume is also an skill and ability. due to this reason people real commitment is no more with the company and the job, this is for both candidate and the hiring manager."
Online reviews state that you must use an external recruiter and/or know someone in the company in order to gain consideration for a position.  I feel that some contact from company recruiters may help to alleviate that perception.
"Online application process was not user friendly.
And I recommend a recruiter contact applicants and indicate why they are not a good fit.  "
"One suggestion to improve the recruitment process could be to allow more person to person interview opportunities. This would be beneficial to those who have specific skillsets or multiple skills that would benefit Johnson & Johnson in a positive way. People who have a strong work ethic and the ability to learn quickly would be preferred.

Another strategy could involve giving out a standardized IQ test in addition to the application process, based on the materials or information needed to succeed in the workplace. This could vary based on those job requirements."

One of the way the company can improve the recruitment process is to acknowledge the other applicants by giving then an interview.
"one of the useless questions you are putting forward , if only talented person join in your company then j&j wouldn't achieved this much score in these decades , so  talent is not shown in front of every human being like a mirror , it will inside because god created  every person with all things , so be a creator and don't be a .... thank you....

One of the things that always create more value is to contact the candidates to explain why they were not selected if the candidate ask for a feedback.
"One of the reasons I applied for that position was because of JJ's culture and being known as a great employer. 

It took four weeks to get an update on my application, final decision in this case, and I questioned if JJ reads applications. 

I wonder if this is the typical process or was a one off situation. 

Thank you for asking for my opinion.

"
One of my interviewers cancelled and I dod not get the opportunity to meet with them before the decision was made.
"One of my answers may shed a poor light on the recruiter, and this was not my intent.   He was professional and courteous.

""Did the recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to?""  

I answered ""No"".  This is because once I learned the opportunity was only an 18 month assignment, I withdrew my candidacy.  He mentioned there may be other opportunities within J&J I could apply for at the end of the 18 months, if  any were available.   Having a secure position with my current employer, this presented too much uncertainty to entice me away.

If another opportunity presents with J&J, I'll definitely consider it.

"
"One item to enhance the recruitment process for candidates which have found a suitable opening would be to include an applicant's timed written response (<500 words) to scenarios encountered by current employees whom are already filling that, or similar, positions. In this way, the non-intuitive qualities of an applicant which are difficult to interpret by reviewing a resume may be evaluated."
"Once you submit an application, be courteous enough to let an individual know you got their application. let them know if they at least have a chance for an interview."
"Once profile will be shortlisted, candidate can be contacted through phone."
"Once it is clear that the candidate meets all the key requirements , it would be good if there can be a recruiter allocated to talk to the candidate for further screening.   Many a times qualified candidates for a job like myself find it very disrespectful and treated badly if there is no recruiter contact, no timely response to the application and the status other than the quick acknowledgement of the application which is system generated.  Till date I have not received any proper response for any of the jobs I have applied though i have found myself a well qualified candidate based on my experience and matching it with the requirements outlined"
"Once I found out that this position has been offered to another candidate, I was hoping to understand whether there are other opportunities that might be a good fit and inquired with the talent acquisition manager.  I have not heard back yet but am optimistic about finding a good fit at J&J, especially due to my extensive experience in the pharmaceutical industry and eagerness to work for J&J.  "
Once a recruiter conducts a phone interview and states that they are moving you forward to the next step of an in person interview it's usually a good idea to actually schedule it. I never heard back from him so obviously it never happened
"Once a candidate is not going to be considered for a job please notify them.

Some requisitions show they have been open for almost a year and are listed as priority.  

I have not had any contact or updates from website and have purposefully applied for jobs I am over qualified for to see if there is any response.  Yet to see a response except this survey asking for feedback."
"On the hiring end, recruitment is a painful and drawn-out affair.  Often it takes two or three weeks just to get ""the box"" created and initiate the recruiting process.

On the job searcher end, the lack of consistency across recruiters, timely updates, and actionable feedback make the process a ""black box."""
"On the application, provide some space to clarify some question. This case for me the recruiter conatct me and clarify some question , and provide me with more information related up the closure of the posted position due to cancel by restructure.

I am very please with the recruiter action, we need more recruiter like her."
"On November 11, 2016 I was interviewed on the telephone by Jonathan Lowell for a legal position for which I was qualified.  I have a number of contacts at J&J, I discussed the opportunity with them, and I was intrigued.  The interview went extremely well and Mr. Lowell told me that I appeared to be an excellent fit for the position and he would definitely be recommending that J&J continue to pursue me.  Not having heard anything by Thanksgiving, I followed up with an e-mail to Mr. Lowell on November 28.  I never heard again from Mr. Lowell.  I did receive a form rejection e-mail from J&J on February 6, 2017, almost three months after my telephone interview with Mr. Lowell. I suppose you can draw your own conclusions about how J&J might improve the recruitment process.  Best regards."
"On LinkedIn, i tried to apply for jobs, however the system ""spun"" and ""hanged"" during the transition to the website. I have heard from others that they will only apply to jobs with INApply, not EASYApply because EASYApply has too many issues.  I applied to this job and only got a standard form letter asking for a survey. I was not aware I was rejected for this job until I got the request for this survey. 

I would strongly recommend that JnJ use the INApply, where you can use the profile you built and attach a resume to the application. "
"on each job position description must have a brief description of j&J recruits people outside the country where the position is available or not,therefore if the person is expatriate don't waste time filing the form. Because it seems that if the person is not from the country and has legality to work, they do not even review the curriculum to corroborate that it is viable to hire"
"on all employment applications ethnicity should not be a question, a persons' qualifications should be the determining factor, not the person's ethnicity"
"On a positive note, there Wada response advising that the individual is not a suitable candidate.  This is extremely helpful as most organizations does not take the time to respond at all.

Feed back on why a candidate is not a suitable match would be even more beneficial.

However overall a J&J have a good process."
"On 02/27/2017 I received a call from Jake Bolcalski about 1050 am. He left a short message to give him a call about a position I applied for along with his number 1-717-207-3867. I returned his call in about 15 mins. left a message.
Called again that same day and several times the rest of the week leaving messages.  I never received a call back.  Have no idea on the feedback or the opportunity that was available. So was highly disappointed it Jakes over all ability and manners. I can not judge J & J on their recruitment process, but left me a bit disappointed.
                Thank You, Gary DeWees
Hopefully this will lead to a more positive result for other candidates.

Old fashion communication would be appreciated.  Candidates should be given the courtesy of knowing if they are being seriously considered or not.
Oh...I don't know...actually have the technology work.  The application process was full of technical errors and insane usability issues.
"Oh! This is so hard! Let me take a stab at it. With possibly hundreds if not thousands of applicants applying for each open position, it would be counter-productive to have a recruiter contact each one. However, a timely response of under 14 days to receive a notification of ""still under consideration"" or ""your qualifications, while commendable, are not a proper fit for this position - thank you for your interest"" would be an improvement. 
I worked tirelessly and earned high commendations for my years as an office-based/hospital specialty representative with Janssen Pharmaceutica. I applied the skills I gained in sales/communication to my role as a homeschool educator. I had a son with severe asthma who could not benefit from the traditional school system due to repeated hospitalizations at an early age. I was forced to make the choice to stay home with my son to give his lungs proper time to heal. At the time, as a hospital specialty-rep in Seattle, WA, I was on the fast track to securing a position as a sales manager. Choices force change. 
Sixteen years later, I am sending my third child off to college. All three of my children will be enrolled at universities this Fall. All three received academic scholarships. Certainly, my organizational skills and drive for excellence I applied as a specialty representative impacted their successes. Foremost, I believe my unique ability of discernment, analyzing strengths in learning styles, and applying those in all modes of academic discipline played a major role. Ironically, those same skills I have honed while homeschooling would promote a unique advantage as a sales manager.
Many hats have been worn these past 16 years, it's hard to capture on a resume the vast experiences I've gained. Listing speech/debate coach, creating my own website for an English Literature class I've run for the past 8 years (www.wordlyways.com), founding and running a successful scouting troop, co-founding an educational co-operative that has grown from 60 students to over 250 in 2 years focusing on college-prep courses, speaking before the Senate Education Committee in Alabama's state court to promote the Tim Tebow bill, training horses and providing outlets for foster children in need - each of these share a snippet of my qualifications/drive. However, simply putting ""homeschool mom"" on a field does not quantify the roles and responsibilities adequately.
I may be at a disadvantage having left the corporate field 16 years ago, but the courses I have traveled, the leaders I have met and engaged with only spur my desire to share my knowledge and skills with the next generation of sales agents. I have excelled at motivating and encouraging, spurring on my 'charges' to excellence and utilizing every available resource.
I would hope a recruiter might be able to read through the resume, make that phone call to candidates such as myself, and be surprised by the vision and commitment behind the online form. Does that answer the question?"
offshore contract house only picking like resources
Offer to train a new hire or even take a chance and hire a person that has a capable background even if it isn't a computer perfected match.  The candidate knows it but it would build a strong work ethic and brand loyalty that goes beyond employment

"Offer candidates and prospective candidates more detailed background information about what you're looking for, and why: then let people try to show you in their cover letter & application how/why they'd be a good fit.  Their attempts would be a lot more revealing re: their approach to the job; and your assessment of their efforts would be better informed."
Offer automatic emails for positions matching applicants desires/abilities
"Offer an option to find out why you were not hired.  

Offer something similar to Stella: (example)

"Offer a interview at least. You do not know any thing about a person,untill you meet in person."

Occasional feedback on why someone has not been selected would be helpful. 
"Obviously, I am disappointed that I didn't get a job. I was pretty excited about working at the new tech center in Rhode Island. As for the application process, I was disappointed that I was never interviewed. I felt like I could have contributed as a junior developer to J&J, and I was bummed that I didn't the opportunity to make my pitch. Plus, I never got a phone call or anything. Just a nice rejection email. 

So I think that J&J could improve its process by identifying people that it might want to keep in touch with for future opportunities. "
Obvious discrimination of highly qualified people over off shore resources
"Obey your own process.
Interview based on ability not age.

Thanks, Fitz 2038953480"
"Nowadays its a shame how I was treated recently on an interview with J&J (McNeil). I guess time has changed. Back days my 1st job was with Janssen family. I had a blast for long 13 yrs (regular) + 3 yrs (temporary). I learned a lot and I was taught a lot. Year evaluations were over 3.5 - 4 score (5 was the highest). Always exceeded my expectations.  My working habits had not changed since then. The 1st level of interviewing process is not familiarized with the kind of job or tasks the position is asking for. I personally experienced it. At the end of the interview I was told I was candidate for the 2nd level interview, then suddenly (2-5 days later), I was not. No reason or explanation given. ;("
"Now a days there is an adopted culture to recruit through the ""middle man"" called recruiters and agency. They do come handy at the cost of employee. In my opinion to increase the hiring, may be the HR of the corporations put some program and reduce the middle-cut (that comes to ~ 30 % of payout). If there are more layers in recruitment process - the employee gets almost 20 % of the payout by the company.  I am quoting someone from 2014  ""The fully loaded cost of an employee ten years ago at large pharmaceutical companies was about $325/hr.""  I ask to do some justification. What kind of talent company is looking for - rest on what employee gets in the end."
Notifying candidates whether they have been moved forward.

Notify the candidate sooner than two weeks after the interview of the outcome of such interview.
"Notify the candidate once they have decided not to proceed with their application. This feedback is specific to Senior Finance Manager Consumer - Worldwide Business Development (Req ID 0808161114). After the in-person interview with the hiring manager and the team noone reached back. The HR recruiter did not respond to my follow up email, while the hiring manager's admin sent a note that they would be in touch. No word after that. 
This sort of treatment speaks certainly does not reflect well on the organization. A confirmation that all that glossy stuff on their website, credo statement etc. does not translate into the actual workplace. "

"Notify candidates of the status (In review, not chosen, or the position has been filled).

Notify candidates if they got the position or not in a timely manner.  I no longer want to waste anymore energy in J&J and its products.

I'm disappointed not to have been hired for this job; however, I am *EXTREMELY IMPRESSED* that I was informed of the outcome quickly. The recruiter called me 2 weeks after the interviews to tell me I had not been selected. (I don't even object to automated emails if the company is giving me an answer quickly, but the phone call was a nice touch.) You treat your candidates with respect, and that projects a very favorable image of your company. Thank you. "

Albeit, i applied in December for several maintenance type jobs. I never heard any response.
So i went back to the oilfeild.
I will finish the year out there im guessing.

Not sure why this is being sent to me as I was never contacted
Not sure why I receieved this survey - never received a call nor and email.
"Not sure why I got this survey.  I applied for this position back in Fall of 2016 and never heard anything after that.  No phone screen, no interviews and no rejection letter.  This position was within my home organization and was filled ~2 months ago by someone outside JNJ.  This survey added insult to an already disappointing situation.  

You may want to assess when these are sent and to whom."
Not sure why I got this survey as I was never contacted about the position or interviewed in any way.  I wasn't exactly sure what to write as all I received after a while was a thanks for applying email.  Not sure how to review a number of these steps.
Not sure why I even received this survey - I did not have any phone screening or interviews for this position - can't answer the questions because it doesn't really apply????????
Not sure why I didn't get a call.. I have all the qualifications
not sure why I am receiving this survey as no one has called me about the role i have applied to. 
Not sure why I am getting this survey.  Did I not get selected for the position I applied for?
Not sure what you guys want . No one reached me from the recruitment team and after a long time looks like some system generated email that you are not selected and now you guys are looking for feedback... not sure if I didn't went through the process at all how I'm applicable for the Survey... again this survey also not capturing much details... so looks like total process need to be reviewed... else this is something bad for such great organization.
Not sure what you can do. Seemed like the hiring manager had his mind made up regardless of my credentials. I was the best person for the job but passed on. I understand that the person that was hired can't handle the job and contract folks were hired to help her. Good move by the hiring manager. 
"Not sure what caused J&J to turn down my application. I have solid experience in this area, and was only sent a generic email in response to let me know I was not selected. I am not even sure if the hiring manager even reviewed my resume."
"Not sure I can answer that as I do not recall getting that far into the hiring process. However, I would love to be an employee of J&J."
"Not sure I am completely familiar with the whole process. Only once in the last 22 years since 1995, did I ever get a call to fill out questions regarding a Vice president for molecular diagnostics position some time in 2004.

Not sure how someone that works in the industry with a proven track record of sales success gets a reply in less than one hour stating that they arent qualified for the position...not sure if anyone looked at the resume
"Not sure how relevant this survey is. I was never contacted by a recruiter for an interview. I received an email indicating my application was reviewed but not being considered. 

It would be good to get additional feedback as to primary reason why application is not being considered. "
Not sure as I want recruited I applied via a job listing nona job board...I have always had an interest in J&J and would of loved an opportunity to speak with one of the recruiters in person or via phone too fully discuss what I could bring to the J&J team. Only so much can be understood from a resume and speaking to a candidate directly might bring some great addition as to the team that may not pass through ATS due to not enough key words!.
"Not sending an email notifying applicants that they've not been chosen says a lot about how the company does or does not value both clear communication and/or potential employee labor. It takes the applicant significantly more time to tailor information and fill out the company-specific online HR form (which includes a specific field for email, so that data should be easy to aggregate) than it does to send a form email to rejected applicants. No notification makes the company look like they view the work relationship as usurious and labor-squeezing from the get-go. Whether or not that's true, it might be a good idea to *pretend* people are valued at Johnson & Johnson, considering the company's brand and mission statement."
Not send me these surveys.
Not send me surveys when I never even had a phone interview with them.
Not rely so much on candidates with precisely 3 years of experience. This is how you lose out on qualified individuals.
Not reject applications for qualified candidates 
"Not post jobs you intend to fill with internal candidates 

You are the worst company for lack of communication. Yes and no are perfectly good answers, pick one!!

Silence is soul crushing especially when you are recommended for a role by a current employee. 

Eve now this survey speaks to your arrogance and lack of empathy. "
Not only seek to employ American for an American post. Other countries citizens may do the job better! 
"Not only for this job, my overall experience with JnJ recruitment process is insane. Sorry to tell you that I do not have a good feeling about the recruitment process. Please do not think I'm frustrated since I do not get through with JnJ, rather my experience with different application/interviews are frustrating. "
"Not much.  Very straightforward.  Although rare and unusual, as a candidate it would help to be provided feedback as to why I was not selected and perhaps areas where I could improve upon if I were to reapply to future opportunities."
"Not just send automated messages 2 months later saying ""after careful consideration, we regret to inform you..."""
Not just JNJ but every company has to have a different approach when trying to recruit Senior and experienced talent. so if JNJ wants to differentiate themselves they need to have a different approach to recruiting and not the one I experienced 
Not just have an automated email response but rather have the recruiter call or email a personal email to the applicant.
Not Idea
Not hide behind d the computer. This is a sales role so talk to people! !!!!!
"not happy with the process, very disrespectful"
Not got an interview so this survey is not correct
not good
"Not getting responses on time regarding the applied positions. However, I always get the e-mail to write the opinion about the recruiting process. I haven't get any experience regarding this."
"Not get rid of a position during a deployment and then claim that the affected employee will have access to future JnJ opportunities. I was never allowed to interview for any of the open positions as was promised. Instead, be honest. 
"
"Not enough info to respond, correspondence only."
"Not efficient process. I applied for more than 20 positions and did not get any interviews yet. I am pretty sure that I am qualified for most of the positions. I feel really disappointed about applying for J&J jobs.

J&J temp job recruiting is also very confusing. For one job, the candidate can receive 5 to 10 calls with different agents with different titles, hourly rate and duration. 

J&J needs simplify the recruiting process and get more internal and external referrals to hire more qualified people."
"Not discriminate any applicant regardless of their status being an independent/freelancer. In the end, not everyone is lucky enough to get a job at big companies but life goes on and we have to provide for ourselves at the end of the day. Let's not judge but give a fair chance to any applicant. Thank you."
Not contact me again. 
Not cheating

"Nobody contact with me yet and it's being a while, still waiting for a replay"
Nobody called me about this position.
"No, I would think not."
No update nor any confirmation nor even response to as to if the position has been filled up and so forth. I wish I had the option of withdrawing my application if I knew the recruiting process was this unprofessional. Will not advice nor apply to any of the positions from this company ever again in the future.
No transparency in the process - suspect J&J may not be equal opportunity employer

no response at all
"No response after weeks of waiting to hear about a possible interview.  I was simply told I wasn't a good fit.  There were no interviews: only an email weeks after applying.  Fact is, I moved on after not hearing from you.  "
No recruiters were involved with any applications made for jobs.  They were through the internet.  it is helpful for J & J to promptly respond when a candidate is not being considered to close out that particular job search.
"No recruiter was involved at any step of the process.  I searched and found the job opening online without assistance from a recruiter.  I applied via Johnson & Johnson career webpage by filling out a profile and attaching my CV with an accompanying cover letter on December 22, 2016.  My application was confirmed as received in my profile on the J&J career webpage.  The next correspondence I received was on January 24, 2017 with a request to complete a survey from J&J talent acquisition.  Due to lack of any information about the position which I applied, I did not complete the survey.  The next communication I received on 3/4/2017 explaining that my candidacy was NOT being pursued.  In 72 days from posting application to denial of candidacy, I did NOT receive any update on my application status... no email nor phone call.  I understand that as a large company you receive a great number of applications but 2.5 months without any update is very disappointing.  A suggestion may be to clearly communicate a closing date for applications.  That would allow the candidate an estimation on when an application update should be expected. "
"No recruiter has reached out to me regarding not being a good fit at all, this is the first response besides the initial confirmation email of a submitted application I have received.

Alas not a very professional recruitment process for a management level applicant with 10+ years of experience in technology."

No phone call or face-to-face interview in order to decide if I was qualified for the position.

No personal contact at all. 
"No person from J&J HR ever spoke to me, emailed me, or contacted me.
I was highly qualified for the position, and yet I never heard at all.

Overall J&J appears to take the human out of human resources.  The process it used relied on email... realize that the email address this is sent to is barely monitored (it is used only for job searches, depending on how many recruiters I SPEAK to would depend on how often I check, and the emails from JNJ look like spam- every time it is asking me to take a survey before I speak to a PERSON.

In the end I took a job with Ford Motor Company even though the J&J position on paper was much better.

If J&J is taking time to send out this survey to people they don't engage with it make zero sense. It's insulting and I imagine a poor use of resources. This is also comical because I have been invited to an interview at a career fair not that long ago yet my experience doesn't warrant a call from a recruiter at this point. "

No need to improve the process.
No need to have recruiter speak to each candidate and inform them that they will not be interviewed for a position. I think it is very appropriate to let the candidate know via email that they will not be considered for a position so they can move on in their job search. This is the process that J&J seems to follow.
No more products from your company!
No mail recieved from J&J HR

"No interaction with any official, so I can't suggest.  Generally recruiting professionals are not equipped to select right candidates.  Very few companies have good recruiting team.  Since I don't have any interaction with J&J, I can't comment.  I can certainly help develop this."
No initial phone screen or contact was ever made even though I was more than qualified for the position
No information was provided as to why I was not a good fit for the position (Manager or Senior Manager BRQC). It would be helpful to obtain feedback to make an applicant's credentials more competitive so as to join Johnson & Johnson at some future point.  Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback. 
No idea why you're contacting me.

No further comment needed. 
"No follow up. No return calls. Lack of site support for links. 
Very disappointed for such a fortune 100 company. "
No follow up. I was told that someone will call me but no one did. Online submission of the application is kind of a waste of the time since you never heard anything. 
"no follow up.
didn't hear from anyone "
no follow up from JNJ
"no feedback, not even standard letter...just poor culture...happy not to work for j&j and withdrew my application"
"No feedback, no response no contact- absolutely no use in applying online. "
"No feedback, highly delayed judgement!"
no feedback on a job i was qualified for. also you have sent me 5 surveys from one job application. stop fucking sending me surveys especially when I completed it the first time.
No feedback is provided through the candidate screening. While I may or not be the candidate recruiters don't provide any updates through the screening process.
No feedback at all on any application I have submitted other than for my current positon! Need to close the loop either way. I like my current position at Synthes but really dislike the lack of communication regarding applying for a new position. It is a big black hole. 
No feedback after I posted for 2 positions likely we'll over a month to get the feedback that I was not being considered for the position
No contact was made. Would like the opportunity to interview for positions I am qualified to fill. I am a former McNeil/Johnson & Johnson employee.

In the confirmation of application mail there is no link to go back to check on application status.

Going to the website http://careers.jnj.com/ there is no login or anything to check status.

So at end of the day I think I was able to apply, but no way provided to follow up in the manner many other companies allow.

Thanks,"
"NO contact  was ever made with nobody.  Nobody called me.  I have submitted several applications, and only an email was provided stating I was not considered.

Perhaps you should try not being as selective. I also recommend you not request feedback from the folks that you so eagerly rejected, you will receive negative reviews. Thanks again for passing on me, I landed a position that is far more lucrative and accepting than the role you ""offered""

NEVER was interviewed just applied
Never was contacted by recruiter.
Never was called for the interview
"Never talked to anyone, applied online and was expecting at least an interview but just received an email that I am not qualified even though I worked in sales for 26 years, owned my own business, and started a nonprofit.  I was always impressed with Johnson & Johnson and disappointed that I did not receive an opportunity to Interview.  "
Never spoke to anyone nor was I told I was not a good fit.  No interviews ever took place.
"Never spoke to a recruiter, never received any interview. "
Never spoke to a human
Never received feedback on this submission.

Never received any followup regarding the position.
Never received an interview. Not sure why I received this survey ... it is almost like someone is thinking or saying I did but I didn't ...
Never received an interview or an email letting me know that I am no longer under consideration.
Never received an email or heard from anyone!!!
"Never received a call, just an email telling me that I wasn't selected.  It's rather impersonal.  It would be nice to know in a constructive manner why I wasn't selected. "
Never received a call from recruited.
Never received a call from or was contacted by a Johnson & Johnson recruiter.

Never heard from J&J after the application confirmation.
Never heard from anyone....even though I am an experienced candidate.
Never heard from anyone. 
Never heard from anyone even though I'm perfectly qualified.
"Never heard back from the recruiter after the initial round of HR screening ,even after mail follow there was no response. I would be nice to hear back atleast after writing the mail."
Never heard back from anyone.
never heard back 
Never heard anything from Johnson other than to complete survey 
Never heard anything from a recruiter.  I was quite surprised I wasn't a fit considering I have multiple tier awards including oncology in my first year of sales which is not an easy task.
Never heard anything 
never heard any communication  or feedback regarding my application to this role. 
"Never heard an answer one way or another.   I totally understand that not everyone is an ideal candidate - but if someone does not meet your needs - a simple email saying ""Sorry we are not selecting you"".  As opposed to just leaving the candidate hanging."
Never heard a word from J&J
"Never hear back from anyone other than an email that never actually looked at the resume, etc"
Never got contacted - very disappointed
"Never got any response or feedback, not declined, just nothing"
Never got any response inspite of having all the skills and experience.
"Never got an opportunity to interview for this position with over 30 years of director roles in call centers.

Very disappointed I never got an opportunity to at least talk to someone to better understand my value and worth i could bring to the business."
"Never got an interview 
Never got any feedback
Felt I had the experience and attitude/fitness for the position "
Never got a call. Never had contact. Poorly handled 
Never got a call from the recruiter or manager to let me know if I got the position. Was told Kim Walters would call regardless. My personal information was also given to the internal candidate that was interviewing for the job who also got the position while lacking Biologic experience which was wanted. My father works at JNJ and he was asked by his boss if his son was interviewing. 
never give me feedback about my aplication
"Never get opportunity for experience person , "
"Never even got a interview, just a email saying that I was not being considered."
Never contacted.
"Never contacted, no interviews, nothing ..."
Never contacted By the manager .  Only the recruiter suggested that I apply for the position
"Never contacted by a recruiter. Don't know if anyone even reviews these responses or checks on a recruiter - but someone is telling someone else that people are being interviewed and it's just not true! Certainly not ""CREDO-LIKE"", J&J. Shame."
Never contacted by a recruiter. Does anyone even screen these questions before sending them out?
Never contacted about position.  Would ne nice to know one way or another.
Never contacted
Never called or emailed me and as a former employee I would have expected more 
"Never call me for inteview por recruitmen. 
I think they should give people a chance. It is not possible for someone to apply at j & j to have the years of experience they require. I think it is cruel that someone has the preparation and that because they do not have the experience they marginalize it and do not give it a chance. You do not know how much you can contribute even without experience in the pharmaceutical industry or years of experience. Until you're on the field and you can show what you can do."
"Never been contacted for any position I've applied for
"
Never been contacted for an interview
never been contact about any of the jobs I applied for at Johnson and Johnson
"Neither the recruiter not the hiring manager contacted me at all about this position, even after I attempted to connect with the hiring manager several times.  I love J&J, but this displays a lack of professionalism and common courtesy."
"Need to update candidates in a more timely manner. Even if a decision hadn't been made yet, update the candidate to let them know.

The process was very impersonal. You feel like a number. It would be more professional if you received an email with a reason why you did not receive an offer. Mine was simply that you were moving forward with other candidates. I don't remember if I was invited to join J&J's talent community but I don't think so."
Need to provide the reason for not fitment as well need keep the resume in database for future reference 
Need to provide feedback on why a job was posted but then the job was taken down.  No clear follow through on the process and feedback
"Need to provide exact reason for rejecting my application. Without any screening, how would you reject a candidate..such a pathetic one."
need to me involved and talk to current employees and follow up
need to maintain time management
Need to improve the recruiting process. It has being twice that not even an interview has being call for me. Don't really understand how a potential candidate can be disqualified with not being interviewed.    
Need to improve the communication process
Need to hire new comers to canada
"Need to have interview process, not just looking at the resume and saying no. If someone copy paste the resume as per the job requirement that person is called and the right candidate is ignored."
Need to give proper response with reason why not suitable
Need to contact the applicant.
need to contact talent.  0 communication is very poor form.
"Need to communicate with prospective candidates on the current step(s) of the process they are in.  Everyone is busy, I get it...but so are the candidates who spend quality time completing the cumbersome JnJ application process only to NOT hear one word (pro or con).

It appears that JnJ does not value candidates time as much as their own."
Need to call for an interview to see the skills and expertise of experienced person like me.
Need to be more flexible in your hiring proces.
need to actually respond to people - I received no response regarding the positions I applied for. 
need proper feed back for rejection
need more feedback to applicants   maybe personalize dfeedback
"Need feedback regarding the status of opportunities that was applied.  If we take the time to review research and apply for a position the least we should expect is a update to the status of the application.

The problem with industry job, is you must know somebody to get a position."
"N/A
I was only extended a phone screen by the recruiter.  An on site interview was not offered.  However, the recruiter did explain that their were a couple strong internal candidates.  This information was valuable.
thank you."
"N,/A"
"My view of the company based on available external info is favorable, and I would be interested in working there if a position were available."
"My skills are a perfect match for the position I was applying for.  I have worked in the medical device industry for over 10 years and would have been a great asset to your organization.

I was never given any opportunity whatsoever - my resume was just passed up.  Very disappointed with the interview screening process.
"
"My resume was a perfect fit for the role. I am in the industry already, so I would know this. CFA, FRM, multiple products, PM Experience. I imagine an HR or Recruiter screened me out of the eligible candidates before it got to the hiring manager, because I was missing a specific word or title that means the same as other titles on my resume. My company often does the same thing, so I would recommend passing to the hiring manager or hiring talent acquisition persons familiar with the industry in the future."
"My rejection notice was...""we proceeded with other candidates that had qualifications that were better suited"" or something similar which is a form response that hundreds of companies use. It gives no concrete, learnable reason as to why I couldn't interview since my resume met every single job requirement and almost every preferred requirement.  It would be helpful to learn from my applications and how I can better position myself in the industry "
"My recruitment process with Johnson & Johnson was limited. The response timing for my online application was prompt, unfortunately the position in which I was applying for was discontinued so I didn't have any interviews (phone or in person). Through my research, Johnson & Johnson is an extremely respectable company and I am continuing my search for other possible positions within Johnson & Johnson."
"My recruiter was rude, and didn't realize until the middle of my interview that I was overqualified for the position. In addition, she called 1hr earlier than the scheduled call and caught me off guard and didn't offer to call back or offer any apologies."
My qualifications matched very closely with the qualifications listed for the job.  I have been doing almost the same thing for Stryker for 9 years.  I expected at minimum a phone call.  Instead i got a form letter.
My profile was quite matching with the job description. One should have at least a word over phone before deciding the to reject. I would suggest review candidate profiles bit more carefully before taking a biased decision. Thanks.
"My opinion of J&J was 10/10 before the recruitment process. The recruiter was friendly, but I was provided with no feedback, follow up time was slow to none, and I feel that I was overlooked for a position that I was more than qualified for. It was disappointing that the recruiter did not have enough knowledge of the position, nor could answer my questions. The recruiter however was courteous and polite, but unfortunately ineffective. "
"My only feedback was 7 emails sent within 5 minutes of each other. Six of these emails included language ""Your Application Is Under Review"". In the MIDDLE of these emails was one stating that the hiring manager ""...has chosen not to pursue your candidacy..."".
This is a small industry. I knew the name of the individual selected for this position several days before I received the formal emails that my 'application is under review'. My suggestion is to update the tracking system to ""Your Application Is Under Review"" as soon as applications have a) moved forward to the hiring manager, and/or b) been screened out as not meeting requirements. "
"My manager was the hiring manager for the position I applied to, so he had the conversation with me as to why I was not a good fit for the role. The recruiter was awesome."
My manager was the hiring manager and was the only one to keep me informed on this job. This recruitment process happened in a reasonable amount of time and was much more informative. This has not been my experience when dealing with J&J recruiters.
My interview was not the best because of the lighting of the environment which also influenced my outlook during my interview. If I had another chance at an interview I feel as if I can ace it. 
My interview was abruptly cancelled the evening before the interview without explanation.  When I didn't receive a call/message to reschedule I contacted the HR manager and was told an internal candidate was chosen.  I was really never given the opportunity to interview which was disappointing.
"My interaction consisted of filling out an application, submitting a resume/cover letter on-line, and receiving automated e-mails in return.  While not overly personal, it was nice to know application status."
"My friend, who works for J&J, submitted my resume for consideration and I was promptly informed less than 24 hours later that I was not the right candidate.  Less than 24 hours?  Really?"
"My experience with the recruitment process was basic.  I applied for a position online based on a posting I saw for a job in which I was interested.  I received an automated e-mail stating the application was received and my information was entered into the candidate database.  About two weeks later I received what seemed to be an automated e-mail that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue my candidacy.  A few of the larger companies/university to which I've applied have similar communication styles.  Other companies don't even bother to go this far.  So it's good to get closure; however, it would be incredibly helpful if I could understand why I was considered not a good fit.  I am in the job search process and receiving rejections (or no notification) does not position me to make changes that would be useful, or to not apply if there is something that would prevent me from ever being considered a fit."
My experience with the  recruitment process was very limited.  There really was contact at all. I sent my resume into the system and the system responded with a form letter. My qualifications were very aligned with the position available and I would've liked the opportunity to discuss the individuality I bring to the table. 
"My experience was different so the questions in the survey didn't apply. I applied to a job posting on the J&J website. I received an email about a month later explaining that I was not being considered for the position. 

"
"My experience in the recruitment process for the Healthy Essentials Director position was suboptimal. I was not contacted by the recruiter at all, and received the ""Don't be Discouraged"" email 6 months after I posted for the position. This happened while I'd absorbed the responsibilities of the director in my role as Senior Brand Manager of Healthy Essentials."
"My experience and knowledge in the field of communications is vast -- with 6 pharma companies and three mergers, as well as global expertise. I believe I would be a great fit for the company, however, no one ever calls me back after i apply for suitable positions. "
"My dreams and endeavor has always been to try to check a shot of working for J&J. I know how great of a company it is and the many opportunities available for their employees. 

Unfortunately I've never been contacted not once from a recruiter.

I would love to be given the opportunity to prove my experience and work ethics."
"My biggest frustration with the recruitment process is the exclusion of new talent.  Please allow me to explain.  I came out of law enforcement where I had successful career obtaining the rank of Detective Lieutenant/ Division Commander.  In researching the next phase of my career several people in the pharma industry suggested to me that my investigative back ground would make me a good fit for compliance work.  Thus, I enrolled and completed the Seton Hall Healthcare Compliance Certification Program.  My wife is a Senior Director in the industry, primarily specializing in Oncology drugs; both early phase work as well as phase 3B and 4.  Over the many years we have been together I have learned a great deal of industry knowledge from her.  Between my education at Seton Hall and what I've learned from her, I feel I can step into many compliance/regulatory jobs and quickly come up to speed and become an effective member of the team.  However, every job I put in for requires X number of years of industry experience which I don't have.  I hear my wife's frustration with some of her subordinates or members of other teams whose performance is marginal at best, but they have the industry experience. I think it would be a big improvement to the recruitment process if you expanded your focus beyond who has industry experience.  Identify potential employees who have demonstrated their ability perform and have a solid work ethic, who have a proven track record and are driven to succeed.  Look outside the industry experience envelope, you will be surprised at what you will find."
My background with chemical and government regulatory process and principles can be used at any company for the benefit their products. And I think with an interview face to face this would have been clearly identified and I would be a member of the Johnson & Johnson family.
My application was never accepted by the hiring managers because of my status in the US. I am on the working Visa and I was told that J AND J does not sponsor the visa and green card. I wish I got to know this before the application and also that I am not eligible to apply here not because of my talent but because of my status 
Must do the market research for talented people across world specially trained in specific skills & therapy. Also must consider the actual interview rather than just going through the resume.
Must be a better way to make sure you are getting the best talent.
"Must assess the candidates according to the ""unique"" experiences, skills and background he/she possesses. Not according to his/her nationality. Sponsoring for a work permit must not be an issue for a global company like J&J. You're missing the opportunities. J&J's mission is making diversity but you're not acting like making it.."
Much Quicker Turnarounds & Feedbacks of the interview process.
"Ms. Johnson & Johnson: Please accept this amendment related to your recruitment process; Call the short listed candidates to get their feedback about the job, the culture among other queries to check if the candidate fit to your culture.  "
"Mr. Gehring,

I have been sent at least 5 emails requesting that I share my thoughts on the my experience with the J&J recruitment process.
This is the only one that I have chosen to responded to.
If J&J can not take the time to really review my CV/Resume and look at all my experience for a position, it's hard for me to believe that my comments on the company's recruitment process will be of any value or meaning to you and the company.
I was greatly disappointed with getting no contact with a recruiter.
I realize that J&J gets a multitude of job applications for positions daily and there is an electronic screening process that is used. But when a candidate fulfills the criteria of the position there should at the least be a personalized response to explain why the candidate is not being considered.
This may be too much to ask. But sending 5 or more emails asking for an evaluation of the recruitment process is overkill.
Good luck in improving your recruitment process and especially the follow-up on the process.
"
Move communication between candidate and J&J.
mot sure why you post jobs that internal persons will most likely be given high priority .
"Most of my career was spent at JNJ and I always received exceptional performance reviews and sales results.  Upon leaving JNJ to join a start up device company JNJ communicated that they did not want me to leave and that I would be welcomed back. This has not been the case, as I cannot even secure an interview with JNJ for positions that I am well qualified.  My life was JNJ and this is disappointing to experience. "

The process overall was inconsistent and held up due to outside factors."

"More personalized feedback.  I am not confident that a person ever saw my application because the responses seemed automated.  At this level, I am accustomed to receiving a phone call to discuss potential fits for my rare qualifications.  Where the immediate position may not be the best fit, J&J is very likely to have needs in the future that require my skill set - P&L general management in medical devices, licensed attorney, licensed professional engineer, GE leadership program graduate, lobbying experience on behalf of medical devices, acquisition and integration experience, etc.  Without effective follow up, J&J is likely to pay a recruiter 20% of my salary to find me again.  With J&J's scale, I understand the reasons behind it, however it may be more efficient to reach out to non-matching people for certain levels and skillsets (as other competing companies do).  I wish J&J all the best in its quest for continuous improvement on these matters, and appreciate the survey seeking feedback."

"More contact throughout the process, including explaining why I was not selected for the position--that will help me learn how to be a better candidate in the future or what other opportunities may be a better fit. "
"More contact through phone calls, rather than email from recruiter in other states.  I could not answer the questions accurately in this survey, being that I did not receive an interview, only took the MechTechII testing."
More contact sooner rather than automated responses months after the initial contact
More contact from recruiter
More contact  with individuals who are applying.
More consistent recruitment process with more status updates. 
More comunication. 
More communication...
More communication. Faster response to candidates after interview.
More communication.  Looking at 'whole' candidates that are exceptional rather than only those who have 'in the box' history.
"More communication.  I did not get the chance to interview for this position.  It appears that I am not being considered for an interview, so I didn't really expect a recruiter to explain it to me."
More communication.  Did not get to discuss the position with anyone at Johnson & Johnson.
"More communication, feedback and if candidate may not be a good fit for position applied for, let them know if there is something that may be a better fit."
More communication would help. Feedback on why or why not would be appreciated. 
More communication when submitted CV. A call with candidates will be very appropriate 
More communication to applicants 
More communication through the process and updates where I stand 
More communication regarding status of the process and where I stand within it.
More communication regarding recruitment and application process
More communication regarding job status and notify candidates when they ar enormous selected. Was contacted by a recruiter for a different position. This survey is how I know I was not selected for a position.  
"More communication or feedback in notifying  the candidates as to why they weren't chosen for the position.  

**I really admire the company and would
of been honored to work here. I actually modeled for J&J In an ad that was distributed in essence magazine a few years ago. "
More communication on where in the process is my application 
more communication is better
"More communication in recruitment process. Some of the questions, which are un answered are
1) Progress in the recruitment of the position I applied.
2) Reason for not picking up resume.


"
More communication if the position is still active and if the position has been filled. 
More communication from the recruiter to let the candidates know why they were not selected and perhaps suggestions for applying/bidding on open positions.
More communication from the HR team would be appreciated.  If at all possible HR to suggest positions that match a particular skill set for an individual looking to join the organization.

more clarity in communication of why resource has not been selected
More chance to a candidate.
More Advertising
More activities and helpful
Minimize the recruiter's power.
"Might timely contact applicants who are not being considered to inform them of their status.  Also, might want to ensure an applicant has actually been contacted by a recruiter before sending out a survey to assess the interview process."
"Might be more personal. At the current standard,  I feel like just being treated by a cold system. "
Met J&J CEO at the VOWS Symposium in 2015 and got impression that my contract and vendor mgt experiences were transferable to the pharm industry. Apperently not. Seems extraordinarily inbred. 
mention the recruiter concerned with the job position so that prospective employees can connect
mention qualifications of accepted applicant
"Meet the candidate, for you would have realized your recruitment process fails to see the quality in a person, verses just reading a resume. "
"Measure for Continuous Improvement, Test how successful improvements you’re making are and review them for gaps or inconsistencies."
Me parece que el proceso de selección es muy concreto a la vacante que ustedes requieren y felicitaciones al VP de Talento Humano y un gran saludo a la familia Johnson & Johnson.
me parece excelente en la forma como realizan el proceso de contratacion.
Me parece excelente el proceso de contratación. 
Me parece excelente el proceso de contratacion
"maybe they could actually meet all the people who are trying to get a job there. maybe give everybodty a chance 
"
maybe pick up a phone an call people who are applying
"Maybe let someone know they aren't being considered for a job before sending them an email saying ""We'd like to hear from you"". For a second I thought I was being asked to do a phone interview. "
"Maybe let me know why I am not a good fit, although I obviously meet all the minimum requirement of the job."
Maybe just provide some more insight on what candidates can do to help improve their chance of getting into your amazing company. I know there all lots of factors that play into the hiring process and sometimes its just about timing. Im determined to get an interview so will keep trying. 
Maybe just give the real reason why the candidate wasn't the good fit to improve for the next time 
maybe inform candidates on what is going. Applied months ago to J&J. Forgot even applied until this notice. So already wasted more of my time. 
Maybe i will have something to suggest once i am hired and able to observe mire the internal process in JnJ recruitment process.
"Maybe have real people look at application documents (resume, cv, cover letter) and, for those who would have been good matches sent personalized emails with one or two lines of feedback explaining why they were not chosen."
Maybe give more details about why candiate can't be recommended.
Maybe give a reason why I am not a good fit for a job position.
Maybe give  more than the general response to potential candidates. Ask more questions or possibly do a phone or e-screen.
Maybe explain what candidat lacks for the position.
Maybe do not dismiss candidates that do not have 100% criteria match so readily. There is a lot of talent out in the world and rarely does every external candidate fit 100%
Maybe actually interview people before you count them out. A phone call is really the best way because you can not really know anyone from a resume. 
Maybe a telephone call and an actual face to face interaction with the recruiter would be more effective. Technology is paramount for future advancements but should not come as a substitution for face to face interaction. 
Maybe a call to inform the decision since I never been informed about the outcome after phone interview with the hiring manager.
"Maybe a better screening process, might help you narrow down the applicant pool a little better so you can build an interpersonal connection with the pre-selected applicants."
May I would welcome a survey call
"May I suggest your company the adoption of a more sophisticated web-based recruiting tools so applicants don't have to wait a month or longer to hear that the company has decided not to fill a position?
People will be more likely to apply for a job at a company when they know they will be kept well informed during the application/hiring process.

Thanks!

Carmen Adair"
"may be the time of the year (across the holidays) - but I am still waiting to hear back in any form from either recruiter or hiring manager. I got in touch with the recruiter once to inquire, she replied letting me know that the hiring manager had been asked to let her know when a decision has been made. Since I haven't heard back, I have to assume the position is still open/ the process is still ongoing. Would be nice to get some sort of update."
may be reduce the time for process.
"May be more visibility on Linkedin about your work culture. I, having worked for you I'm aware of the culture and I appreciate it."
May be contact the participant....
"may be a clear message why my qualification did not match on what Johnson & Johnson is looking for.

I doubt that someone went through my resume the time spend between the application and the email received is very short .

"
"Match the position with the profile of potential candidate without even the candidate application, just by creating the profile with all the info you are able to match what you need with the skills a potential candidate has, just like Amazon is doing."
"Match qualifying applicants (with future potential from a resume) to a job opening that works best for J&J. I am an experienced Leader, senior ranking Officer, and Veteran of the United States Marine Corps and Recruiter/Screener for Marine Corps Special Operations Command and I see a lot of job openings at J&J. The company can fill more vacancies with qualified (and even sometimes overqualified applicants) if they reversed the process and found a good fit for their job openings from a pool of resumes already obtained from previous job applicants that have already applied to J&J. My grandparents both worked for J&J and I have always wanted to be apart of a great organization, I just need to work one on one with a J&J Recruiter/representative in order to find a way to best execute and accomplish my goal. Hope this helps."
"Many things, but the most important a courtesy note explain the status of the application can help. "
"Many companies use automated responses. Hearing why I was not a good candidate with my 20 years of experience in the specific area confuses me. I think maybe an English BA is seen as a weakness as compared to science but 20 years of on the floor and on the road  is real life in patient safety and quality of life issues.  I do not understand why I have not been even interviewed. I have been told I am over the top with regard to compliance and audit readiness and the company does not want or cannot support that much compliance effort? Really? Well, then enjoy the 9 or 10 digit fines from the FDA."
"Making the website easier to login and see updates about positions you have already applied for; give updates about the position, provide real timeline about updates"
"Making the questionnaire less restrictive or specific. I never pass the first filter due the very restrictive questions, including for entry level positions. The qualifications could be confirmed during an interview."
Making sure that applicants get updates on their statuses when their application is going through the process
"Making it shorter, easy, quick to apply, and provide status / updates.
The recruitment process becoming very robotic and thus you may be losing talent that can add value to your corporation."
Making a phone interview.
make your respond as early as possible to job seekers.
Make your recruiting website easier to use.
Make your interview coding challenge for candidates 100% clear. I read the challenge description and wrote an app I considered fully working. Recruiter disagreed.
"Make your application process easier/faster  to fill out.  Nobody wants to spend 30minutes filling out an application and not even get a phone call. I apply to many jobs every week and I come to appreciate the jobs that just ask me for my resume, cover letter, references.  I also appreciate good questions like years in Pharmaceuticals sales years promoting similar products or promoting to specialty doctors. "
Make timely contact with the person who applied for the position.  I received the survey which was how I knew I was not being considered for the job.
"Make the survey applicable.

No one ever contacted me."
make the recruitment process transparent and provide constructive feedback
Make the recruitment process more personal and less robotic in nature.  
Make the recruiting process more personable than automated. 
Make the process of applying for jobs easy. 
"Make the process more transparent.  Right now it is very much a black hole.  I was sent the link by senior leadership, expressed interest, applied, and then heard nothing back."
Make the process more transparent on why my candidacy wasn't advanced. That feedback can help me prepare to be a better candidate for future positions.
Make the process more transparent and more personal communication as opposed to a generic thanks but no thanks.
"Make the process more lean and less burocractic. A couple a postion i was not even call or email of the status of the application. I found out months later, that i was not selected, not follow up or any type of communication. as well, interviewer without knowledge of the roles position qualifications. "
"Make the process less secretive and cold.  State what the process entails, the status and some reasoning, which may be generic, for not pursuing candidates further; i.e., numerous Ivy-League responders with much more relevant experience, hired in-house, spelling errors in your resume, etc."
"Make the process faster.  Be transparent about the reasons for each step in the process, positive or negative.  No one contacted at all in this process.  "
Make the process easier by reducing the number of fields required to submit an application. Give some sense that an actual human reviewed my resume and gave it proper consideration.
Make the process a little more personal
Make the online application more user friendly. Make personal contact with candidates and keep them personally apprised of their standing. 
make the J&J career website more user friendly. 
Make the hiring and feedback process a bit faster. I applied for this position on November 20 2016. On April 3 2017 I received a standard mail that I have not been selected for the position. No other feedback was provided.
Make the emails more personable.
Make the current status of the application package more transparent
"Make the application process easier, since applications take so much time. I can spend half a year writing resumes and personalized cover letters to get a few jobs. That is too much time to waste. So, if there is a way that information can be extracted directly from the resume by a program, it will definitely take the burden out of job search. Since data is extracted from the resume, that can ease the workload on the recruiter, as well as the applicant due to the convenience of the format."
"Make sure your systems actually work. I asked to be removed from the panel and yet I keep receiving emails. This survey is a huge waste of your resources. As you very well know, the data from this survey will be heavily biased and no statistical technique will remove that bias. The insights drawn from analyzing this data will be wrong. Save yourself some time and money and stop these surveys.   "
Make sure to update candidate when they are not being considered for a position. I am an MBA student and I applied for job that only requires a Bachelors and i keep getting denied for them. I do not get it. 
make sure the website is working before posting anything
Make sure the follow-up process happens so the applicant understands what the process and the end result.
Make sure that you contact prospect and provide them with answers or opportunities to improve so they may have a future with this great company. 
Make sure that recruiters actually reply to the candidates with the qualifications required for the position and they provide them with the reasons that they were not selected for the position. 
"Make sure that process is consistently followed.  All internal candidates that meet job posting requirements should receive interview call from recruiter and also hiring manager; as a minimum.  Over the past few years J&J seems to be catering to outside candidates (regardless of credentials) and minorities.  As a manager, I always hire the best candidate for the job, regardless of gender or ethnicity  To do anything else is not fair to employees or candidate..   "
"Make sure that candidates receive some communication if the decision process is delayed.  
Candidates should receive some communication regarding the process within 10 business days."
"make sure applicants are actually sent either a ""yes"" or a ""no""?"
"Make sure all applicants at least receive automated feedback when they are not selected to move forward in the process.  This is inconsistent between Pharma and Consumer and across positions.  On J&J Careers, enable positions that are no longer available to be archived or deleted instead of staying on an individual's Job Page."
"Make recruitment a 2 way street, not just a submission-and-guess process where the candidate has no idea of what is wanted or needed."
Make recruiters accessible...I would love to actually speak to recruiter to discuss my qualifications and learn how I might actually seek employment. 
"Make qualifications for positions stricter. I have met the qualifications listed to many positions and applied for 12 openenings, but have never been contacted. Have had interviews for similar positions with Stryker, Arthrex, Medtronic, and Zimmer-Biomet. Somehow J&J has never given me an opportunity."
Make more/better use of initial screening calls to gauge fit of potential candidates.
make it personal. Currentl a very cold process with very poor fedback loop.
"Make it more transparent. It seems like no one cares. i have applied for positions I am a very good fit for and in a couple of cases exactly what I am currently doing. But I never had a chance to speak to a hiring manager or a recruiter. 
Seems like the positions are an eyewash and nothing beyond. "
"Make it more personal. I understand that hundreds of people apply for the same role, but to get a response that isn't generic and to know why I was not selected would be helpful instead of the answer that there were candidates of better fit because this does not help me know what I could improve."
Make it more personal. 
Make it more personal with human interaction 
"Make it more personal at least to our internal employee candidates. I have applied to multiple internal jobs over the last year or two and not once gotten any feedback or a personal email from the recruiter or hiring manager saying thanks for applying. I have only gotten automated generic emails saying the position has been filled. If I remember correctly, these emails have come weeks if not months after the position was filled, so very untimely."
make it more personal and have the HR people actually explain the candidates why they are not selected. Just for future reference.
Make it more personal
Make it more objective. There is a lot of stuff that goes on behind the scenes that truly dictates the outcomes. I feel like the interview and screenings don't really matter because the candidates are pre-determined or pre-selected ahead of the time. 
Make it more human 
"Make it more fair, EOE..."
Make it less robotic.
Make it less impersonal and more responsive
"Make it less difficult to apply. Forget the cover letters and staring at same credentials as people did 50 years ago. 
There is a lot more that J&J can do with the power and people it has if the hiring is done more from the perspective of match for the team, personality, thrive and EQ. Of course education and experience matter and should be considered but one has to also keep in mind that mixing styles and expertise has resulted in lot of great things."
make it fast
Make it easier to search for jobs in the webste having to put all of the filters can be a bit confusing for some people.
Make it easier to find which jobs are listed with which companies... maybe have a specific site for each company's hiring needs?
"Make easy evaluation skills and expertise
"
Make easier to identify jobs by location
"make decisions faster. I had applied for two positions. For one position, I waited one month between the phone screen and the first on-site interview and was told it would be another month before a decision would be made.

But everything else was done well. The J&J careers website is very user friendly and the recruiter I spoke with was very professional, as were the individuals who interviewed me. Overall, a very positive interaction with J&J"
Make contact with the candidates and provide feedback.
Make contact with people under consideration for positions
Make contact with applicants 
Make contact to keep the applicants aware if they were still in the running for the job.
Make clear the distinction between a permanent position and a contract position.
Make certain each and every application is followed up with some type of response - Even if the position is put on hold or cancelled for some reason.
"Make being responsive to candidates a priority positive or negative. However,
get personal with rejections for example: Have a template that lets candidates down easily and encourage candidates to apply again in the future vs. one that specifically omits mention of encouragement to apply for future positions.
"
"Make attempts to get in touch with applicants outside of automated e-mails. Even if it is a rejection letter. I received no notice of any kind for the position I applied to, and then received an e-mail regarding the application process."
Make at least some contact with the applicant. Haven't even been contacted except for this survey. Apparently I was not even considered. 
Make an effort to get in touch with the applicant as to the actual steps of the complete hiring process so I can know what to expect and a time frame of how long it may take. Instead I just keep receiving surveys. Sadly. And have never once received a call or email if my resume/application even was received or reviewed. Thank you for inquiring & listening.
Make an effort to contact applicants other than an automated email notifying them the application has been received.
"Make an effort to contact applicants in a timely manner, whether or not they were selected for the position they applied for."
Make an attempt to screen qualified candidates.
"MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO CONTACT  SO PERSON CAN MAKE CHANGES FOR BETTER FIT
"
Make actual live phone calls.
"Make a personal connection with your caninidates. Don't just send generic ""thanks but no thanks"" emails. You can normally get more from speaking to a person "
Make a call or write an email
"Make a call or send a personal email to candidate, no automatic response. Thank you. Ruben Olivier, M.D."
Maintain candidates updated throughout the process 
Looks like the jobs are to fulfill us labor  requirements for green card process of existing employers
"Looking forward to working with J&J. 

Creating loyal relationships, expanding my reach into accounts and increasing market share is what I do best. Going above and beyond for my customers has allowed me to:
 
>> Grow market share from 30% to 90% AND never lose a customer to a competitor. 
 
>> Sell 3X the number of units compared to the average region.
 
>> Exceed quota for up to 10 consecutive years at multiple organizations.
  
 Thank you,

Looking for my next position at JNJ to Connect Lead Deliver!
Looking at the candidate's employment history and diversity of background and not focus exclusively on medical sales. 
Look outside the typical pharma background for candidates
Look outside the box!  There is good talent available not necessarily in your specific industry
Look outside the box
"look forward, plan for the future; get away from it has always been done this way.
Anyone with a cell phone should know that is not the paradigm to follow.

R"
look for future potential rather than past only.
Look for experience and talent.Have a skype or telephone interview
Look closer at candidates background. Have applied for numerous positions recently and ALL responses have been negative. How do you explain a candidate with over 26 + years of experience in the field that the organization found a better fit? 
Look closely at candidate's abilities.  If a person does not fit the job applied but has favorable abilities search for possible other position to fill within company.
"Look beyond the resume. 
I felt my age was the primary reason that I was not offered the opportunity for a face to face interview.
Jim Trumpey"
Look beyond key word searches for transferable talent interest in J&J.
"Look at work experience & knowledge more,
Just because Idonot have a degree does not warrant being a viable candidate. Years in the industry still should count for something."
"Look at people, not resumes... That's the ABC of finding good talent. After all you rely on references, and if someone who already works at J&J referred me to you, that should mean something.. but apparently it didn't. In fact I haven't heard from J&J for several months after my colleague submitted my resume, and only after he followed up with me and inquired with your HR department did they bother to send me a ""rejection"" email.. So I can't say I was at all impressed by this process, and definitely it wasn't a good use of my time."
"Look at my WHOLE resume and not just the first job. I was in medical sales for over yen years. I have been working at a non-medical company for almost three years but would like to get back into medical sales. Recruiters have consistently said I am not a good fit when in reality, I am an excellent fit if you look at my whole resume."
Look at my resume and contact me to meet for an investment position. 
"Look at my resume - MBA, Successful track record, experience in several disease states and a great team player"
Look at former employees for available positions
"Look at applications, don't just screen them out through using a computerized system. 

I don't know what it takes to make it through screening, because I met allies  of the requirements for the posting, had a solid resume and a well written cover letter. On what basis are people rejected? It would be good to know. I really want a shot at an interview there, but that won't happen unless my application is actually looked at by a human being. "
Live up to JNJ promoted values 
Live phone call vs impersonal email. 
"Live my the letter and intention of the Credo. As a former J&J employee and leadr on both the Centocor and Depuy Credo leadership teams I am very didsapointed in your Teleo geenrated application process. Take a few minutes to look at my profile/Career Connections activity. I left J&J on strong terms 10 years ago and have applied for numerous positions the majority of which I am clearly a credible candidate. I have never recieved a single call nor any meaningful feedback as to why I wasn't selected for even a screening call. 

As a full time recruiter myself, need I remind you that talent is not readily assessed through an algorthym or data query effort. This is a people business. While the logistics of screening candidates are challenging, with the vast resources available to J&J, surely you can do better. 

Respectfully,

Steve  

PS Call anytime if you would like to discuss (303) 912-8842"
Live feedback especially when you are 110% eligible for the job!
Little
Literally anything... I didn't get anything other than this survey... not the best approach!
Like most recruitment processes handled via e-mail there is no human touch. The majority if not totality of the process is automated. I personally prefer to have a phone interview at least and than after receive an email. Thanks
"Like in my last message, today, big businesses have become empty and cold."
Letting the candidate know what prevented them from getting the job.
Letting the candidate aware of the reasons to not continue in the process 
Letter of interest or rejection.
Let us know whether or not our submissions are being considered or not. I still do not know. All I ever get are these surveys
"Let us know if we were chosen and if not, why we weren't."
Let us know how we can improve or to contact us on why we didnt get the position. 
Let them consider those who are applying from African.  
Let the potential candidate know why they were not selected for the position. 
Let the person applying know that their resume has at least been reviewed.
Let the candidates know when they were not selected. Close the process.
Let the candidates know when a position they have applied to has been filled. 
let the candidate know why they weren't selected (not just that some one else was selected) i.e what skills/experience they were missing
let the candidate know WHY they were not selected
Let the candidate know which is his/her status in the recruitment process.
Let the candidate know what's going on throughout the process. 
Let the candidate know they were not chosen for the job.  And that they should be on a J&J job board for the future.  
"Let the candidate know the results of the company's search/ decision on next steps. I have formally applied for about 5 positions through your online site and haven't heard back the status of my application (even after 2 months waiting). In addition, when not selected for the next step in the interview process, no feedback was provided as the reason why I wasn't selected. Thanks"
Let the applicant know when they are not going to move further with their application
Let someone know Something! Worked there 15 Years! Experienced
"LET PERSON INFORMED ON FIT FOR JOB
"
Let people know why they did not get the position. 
Let people know why the were not chosen!
Let people know why not. Not genetically in an email. Feedback is always positive in this process. Even if a rejection. What are you looking for that's missing for the persons next application w or wo j&j. 
Let people know where they stand in the hiring process and provide feedback.
let people know what they can improve on so that they can be a better candidate in the future 
Let people know what is going on.  I applied for this position and out of the blue (a month later or so) I get an email that I was not wanted for the role.  Overall terrible experience and no communication to applicants which is not fair to them trying to figure out their job situation.
Let people know what is going on with the job application process.
Let people know if they are no longer being considered for a Job.  It seems like you applied for a job and then all information goes in to a black Hole !!!
Let people applying know
"let me search for jobs by pay grade (25, 26, 30, 31)"
let me know why you feel I am not the right candidate for your posted opening
Let me know why I haven't been chosen for an interview so that I know what I need to work on or accomplish to be considered. 
Let me know what I need to do to have the proper qualifications for a position. I have over 18 years experience selling capital equipment and disposables in to the medical market and 2-yrs experience as a clinician. All I'm told is that a different candidate got was given the position. 
Let me know what I can do to become a better fit for the company.
Let me know the reason I didn't proceed forward in the recruitment process 
"Let me know if there is a chance of an interview, yes or no for particular job! Thank you!!!"
Let me know if I got or didn't get the job
Let me know if I didn't get the position
Let me know if I am not being considered as a candidate and how I can improve my application for the future. I feel that I am a very strong candidate so it is frustrating to not hear any response.
Let candidats know why they werent chosen for there self improvement or self knowledge. 
Let candidates know whether they were moved on initially and through rounds as well...promptly.
"Let candidates know if a recruiter has actuallly reviewed my resume, and/or if the hiring manager ever reviewed the resume.

I meet all job qualifications, and have not been called for a recruiter phone screen-hard to believe.  I get calls from other pharma companies and J & J is a black hole.  Do the hiring managers at J & J actually talk to a diverse slate of candidates?

I have no idea how to get a better experience, J & J is not interested in an experienced female sales leader.  Other pharmaceutical companies are!"
Let candidate know when the position has been filled and give pointers on how to improve your chances next time.

"last time i was actually interviewed by the recruitment office i didn't understand why i didn't make it to the next interview so i called to ask.  The position i was going for wanted experience in managed market working with detail data.  I have 28 years working in managed markets and with detail data ESI, Medco etc some of the bigger accounts.  I was basically told that the process was difficult and sometime things are missed.   I worked for J&J a total of 30 years and like I said in the managed markets for 28 years.  I finally did a position out of managed markets but had to do it basically by talking to the hiring manager and the director in this department.  I really do not have much faith with recruitment and they never even helped me explained any programs suggested any opportunities to me, nothing.  They did nothing for me."
Lack of information throughout the whole process. Worst experience ever within the top pharma I interviewed with
Lack of feed back does not leave a god taste.
Lack of detailed response and time it takes to hear back is among the worst I've ever experienced.  My take away is that the only reason I don't fit profiles for your roles is age related.  
"La seleccion de candidatos para la posicion no funciona atraves de entrevistas telefonicas.

Kindly invite people for assessment process.
"Kindly get me to an interview table.  As a former employee, I left the company on good terms to pursue external opportunities which have strengthened my ability to add value to J&J.

I have 12 bridged years with the company, a Masters' degree in relevant areas, and over 20 years of life sciences industry experience, yet have not been able to secure an interview, despite submitting many applications in the past 3-4 years.  I love the corporation and everything it stands for.  Previously, I helped keep a countless number of J&J employees healthy and safe, generated revenue for the MD&D division, and trained new hires on the Credo values.  

The application process has been a black hole for me.  Please give me a chance to come back to J&J and help lead your healthcare innovation efforts in an appropriate role.  I can be contacted at 908-875-1878 and/or Dana.darst@gmail.com."

Keep the candidate informed of the status of the process and provide timely feedback.   
"Keep prospects in the loop.  I applied for positions that I am highly qualified for but have received virtually no feedback.  I have a friend that is a recruiter for J&J in South Florida who followed up for me and was told that the nature of the HR positions in general have changed.  Changed how?  My background fits the job description yet every time I apply, I get little or no response other than to verify that I applied.  Not impressed.  "
"Keep people in the loop. I apply for jobs and never hear anything again. Or I apply, someone contacts me and I never hear anything again. Or, best case, I actually get an interview and then I'm stuck for weeks, not knowing what happened. No contact at all. Even if I e-mail the interviewers, I hear nothing back. I'm a 20+ year J&J employee and feel like I'm worthless to the company"
Keep me updated.
Keep me updated on future prospects. 
Keep me up to date as to what is going on.  I called and emailed several times to understand what was going on.  And since I wasn't a good fit I asked what was it that I lacked or needed to do.  No answer was provided.  I want to better myself in the interviewing process and its hard when you are not provided any feedback
Keep it up
"Keep in touch.  Let me know where you are in the process.  I sent in my resume and then never heard back.  After a long period of time I figured you were not interested.  Then, weeks after I assumed you were not interested I got an email letting me know I was not a match.

I realize, depending on the number of applicants, that it's unrealistic to contact everyone personally.  I do really appreciate a quick response though.  Other companies send system messages very quickly which may be a tad impersonal but it's still appreciated.  

In general, applying online is sort of like a giant black hold for resumes.  My suggestion would be to take advantage of technology to leverage a better process.

Good luck!

Keep doing what you are doing. Great company!
Keep contacting employees with the information about the position they applied for 
Keep constant contact on any status  updates with a candidate.
Keep communication with the candidates and provide feedback about the candidate selection process. In my case feedback is not provided and in some instances system rejection letters are sent to close the process with the candidate. Then you see in some cases the position being posted again.
Keep candidates well informed. 
"Keep candidates promptly informed of their status.  This questionnaire was the only notification I received, and this was the second time in one year that I had the same experience with a J&J interview cycle."
Keep applicants up to date during the process.
Keep applicants posted on the timeline
Keep applicants more informed. There is very limited feedback!.
Keep applicant informed of status.
Keep an open mind
Keep an open line of communication with prospective employees. 
Keep a minimum communication with a job applicant and let him or her know a yes or no.
Just to let the candidate know why they weren't moved forward. 
"Just to let someone know why they are not a good fit for the position--I always look to improve myself so if it's a skill, etc. I would like to know so I can better myself for the next interview--thank you--"

Just reject me as a candidate faster 
Just providing a feedback. Silence is not an answer of who cares about people.
Just perfect
"Just outsource your positions to India or Iraq or somewhere else since you have no intent to hire Americans.  Having worked for the Trump election and speaking with some people now in power we are aware of companies which say they will hire American and really do not intend to do so.  We the public are not stupid, many of my co-workers from Pfizer and other great companies see patterns in J&J that seem to show you do NOT what to really fill these jobs here.  Shame on you all."
Just one sentence. Focus on right candidate and Top performers
Just more of a time line when the possible start process would begin and when I would start in the field.
"Just more contact and information, response.  My wife is a former JnJ (Ortho McNeil) employee ... JnJ is a GREAT company, and I am constantly looking for opportunities to join the company; whether it be due to experience/qualifications, or future career goals/aspirations, or alignment with specific locations.  I understand and realize that I may not meet the desired requirements for some of these positions, but I'd love to have an opportunity to find out the best pathway there through conversation.  I respect and know the type of company that JnJ is, and I'm interested in learning about opportunities that align my skills and goals with company needs."
Just make sure that for each unique position applied there would be a unique reply.
"Just make sure candidates are given the opportunity for pre-screening or interview. If condidate is not selected, then some feedback / recommendatrions will be nice..."
"Just like any other company, J&J seems to be hiring internally for all mid level manager and above roles. Not sure why to play with the emotions of the prospective candidates when you are already aware who would be your internal hire."
Just let people now why they are not being hired and what could they do to get hired the next time.
"Just let me know when I apply if you have an interest and if not give me some indication why you have no interest.

Without any feedback I have no way of knowing what I need to adjust to stand a better opportunity for the next opening."
Just keep it up!
Just keep doing what you have been doing.  You are the best company around.
Just invite and compare the candidates or send a short information why you didn't be invited.
Just give me the opportunity to serve once more.

"Johnson and Johnson's recruiting process needs to seriously be improved.  I don't believe the Jacksonville office is diverse.  I have bee an Executive Assistant all of my life with a BS in Business Administration, currently work on a Master's Degree in Business with a specialization in HR management, yet I am not qualified for an entry level job?"
Johnson and Johnson was family to many of my relatives in the past with a great reputation of hiring people.  I have 32 years of experience in a job that I have applied for on more than 1 occasion and was never contacted back why I was not selected.  Johnson and Johnson really shocked me.
Johnson and Johnson should notify applicants if they're not a good fit for the job. A lot of time gets spent completing the online application and then it hits a brick wall.
Johnson and Johnson should follow up with candidate with reason why he or she is not chosen.
"Johnson and Johnson sends a message to hiring from with in.  Based on this , I expected better communication.  "
"Johnson and Johnson is highly desired company to work for. I have had few opportunities to bid and interview and majority of the time I found recruiting team very slow and unresponsive. So far only one recruiter followed up to explain me that I was not selected. All other times, I either got an automated email or nothing at all. I did not have this type of experience from any other company. When someone invested that me multiple phone and in person interview, I found it very disrespectful to not have a courtesy call for the decision. My feedback here is only on recruiting process and not based on the outcome of the process. "
"Johnson and Johnson is a great company.   The recruitment tools are not up to the standards of the company. 

As a former employee, I will alway rank jnj strongly and refer folks because it was a great place to work.

"Johnson and Johnson has been elusive for the last 10 years when it comes to the recruitment process.  During my 13 year tenure at SMES I was diligent as a front line manager in managing the expectations of candidates as well as ensuring that candidates walked away from our conversations with a positive experience of our process.  I know from multiple employees with whom I worked that were laid off and sought to reapply for J&J openings that the courteous professionalism one would anticipate based on proven top rated performance at J&J was missing.  I now, too, have applied for multiple positions at J&J since the 2010 full layoff of our J&J franchise.  I have had multiple interviews along the way.  The only and most positive experience I've had was with RBD Bob Russel.  He was direct and consistent with his communications and when I was not selected he continued with the same direct communication.  I appreciated our open dialogue and respected his hiring decision.  With every other conversation I've had with recruiting or hiring RBDs I've been left in the dark until the position was ultimately filled with another candidate and I received a standard decline letter.  "
"Johnson and Johnson has a such a great reputation but after I applied I never heard anything back.  The only time I heard anything back from anyone was these surveys.    I would be a great fit for Johnson and Johnson so its a bit upsetting not hearing a yes or no, the only response I've gotten is to take a survey."
"Johnson and Johnson does not have any problems, but a lots of recruiters still having racial problems. I knew that is because I'm a minority tool maker and there's not a lot of employers will give me a chance to prove to them what Can do for them and what I know thank you."
Johnson and Johnson do not get back to you when you apply for positions and they dont consider you from online applications for any positions unless you know someone in their business. 
Johnson and Johnson contacted me about a position that may only last a few months.  The recruiter explained the division may be sold.  He stated if I was chosen for the position it may only last a short time.  I appreciated his honestly.  I am still very interested in a position at Johnson and Johnson and hope to see one on the website that fits my qualifications.
Johnson and Johnson can be more responsive especially in letting candidates who have gone through two phone interviews know if and why they were not selected.
Johnson and Johnson along with all other companies can make the recruiting process more interactive and realistic. They can ask the hiring manager to create short concise scenarios to identify qualified candidates. I feel every company should cut down on software skill requirements because if you didn't work at the company chances are you will not have that particular skill set but a host of others. Also if a candidate is strong in certain areas suggest other open positions and when you say you hired a candidate that is more suitable provide a  little bit of blind item proof. i.e The candidate we choose had an extensive background in biomedical research so it lets the other candidates know where they have to build their skill set.
Johnson &Johnson need to contact and provide the reason prospective applicants weather they are good fit or not for the position applied for. 
"Johnson & Johnson's recruitment process is terrible. J&J's recruitments process and recruiters have consistently and systematically discriminated against me. The process is very unfair, flawed and lacks any transparency. J&J apparently seems to tolerate a culture of rampant employment discrimination in their recruiting process."

"Johnson & Johnson's recruiting practices definitely leaves something to be desired. Looking at the requirements of the role, compared to my experience, education, and certifications, and I was definitely qualified, even more so than what was necessary, and I was never contacted personally. I received two emails, first was a reply to my initial application, the second was an email that stated that I was not qualified for the role, which is truly absurd. My experience that I have been very fortunate to have earned over the course of my career was a perfect fit for this opportunity, which completely shocked me to find out I was passed over, without as much as a simple phone interview. Just and disappointing outcome."
"Johnson & Johnson should stop posting ""GHOST"" positions, that either do not exist or will never be recruited for.  Personally I have know multiple candidates who would easily qualify as well as be an ideal cultural fit for this position who have not heard back after applying.
 Additionally this position has been advertised for over one and half years under different requisition numbers. This would save potential applicants a lot of time. Feel free to reach out if additional feedback is required."
Johnson & Johnson should make sure the prospective employee receives a response while applying for employment even if it is an approval or decline for employment.
Johnson & Johnson should give chance to older candidates
"Johnson & Johnson should contact its prospective employees, the feedback may help someone move forward with their career. "
"Johnson & Johnson should be more transparent and respectful to applicants. 
Please don't bother telling me you hope I join your ""talent community"" and apply for other openings unless you are willing to let me know what I could do better to be more competitive.
I am 53 years old and I believe Johnson & Johnson hiring managers do their company a disservice by discriminating against older candidates, whether this is intentional or not.  Is it really better to reject someone because they appear ""over qualified"" or have ""too much experience"".  Corporations claim to support diversity and always claim to not age-discriminate but computerized applicant tracking systems are abusive to applicants and cast a dim light on corporations that use them.
Do you really want to improve your recruitment process?  Then, hire a good software developer to build a web application that allows the user to upload their resume, enter their name and any required information NOT on the resume along with the required EEO/Vet/Disability information.  Leave out the cover letter - no candidate or company is served by a cover letter.  Just get the basic information and let me click the submit button.  
I have built effective web applications like the one described above.  And, I am not employed so feel free to hire me on a contract basis to put a better resume submission application online for you.  Then, just stop sumarily rejecting candidates unless they are really not qualified.  
If you reject my application for a job that I have many years of experience doing, be decent and let me know that I should not bother applying to other positions.

Thanks for asking my opinion.  I hate coming across so negative but when you get rejection emails from 100 ATS systems in two months, negativity comes naturally.  If Johnson & Johnson cares about me as an applicant, call me at 865-406-4334 and give me some helpful hints to improve my chances of getting the next position.  If you do not care about me as an applicant, why ask me to take my valuable time filling out this online survey?  I already spent hours making my resume and cover letter match your job description.

BTW, we all hope the economy improves.  When it does and all the recently graduated millennials are hired by your competitors, you will be at a competitive disadvantage because experienced and talented candidates will not bother to apply through the ATS process.

Johnson & Johnson seems to only hire contractors. I can't get a job at Johnson & Johnson as an actual employee BUT my boss goes to colleges to recruit and one position I applied for is being held for someone who graduates in May.(I have a degree!!)  
"Johnson & Johnson needs to improve following things:

First you need to find talented people of different countries where your company work
take recruitment written test in form of MCQs
provide an opportunity to those who are fresh candidates (Cause someone have ability to give your company value or products better quality as compare with other's companies)
and last one thing you people know much more which is best recruitment process for your company
thank you for giving me opportunity to survey

Johnson & Johnson need to actually have technical expert in that field to do the recruitment process i.e for Technical he should be an expert in R&D and even for US vacancies indian should be given due consideration.
"Johnson & Johnson its a great employers, the recruitment process 100% positive."
Johnson & Johnson is surely a target company for me as a Marketing executive. I always keep my eyes opened for opportunities. Unfortunately I only had one contact by the recruiter from a lot of positions I applied.
"Johnson & Johnson is a great company.  However, its recruitment process needs to be improved.  Every candidate that applies should get a 5 minute personal telephone call response to thank them for applying and to see if they can be matched up with a job.  "
"Johnson & Johnson is a great company and I would highly recommend to any family or friend; I am a long time employee and have progressed in my career.
But the recruiting process is very bad.....I'd give that a 2-3.  I rarely get notification on positions I apply for and I have NEVER been provided any feedback when I have either not gotten an interview nor if I have attended interviews and did not get an offer.   More than once I have been in the final round, attended 2-3 rounds of prior interviews and then later see an announcement it's been filled.    "
"Johnson & Johnson is a fantastic company, and I would highly recommend, but I would advise them that they should not expect a timely response for either application or survey based on my experience."
Johnson & Johnson have a excellent recruitment process. I thing that's not have to improve anything in the process.
"Johnson & Johnson has to empathize with experience candidates who take efforts to apply for job postings.  It is disappointing to get rejection emails without any screening.  I thought I am well experienced for the job posting #5662170109 [IT Director, Clinical Research Medical and Regulatory Affairs].  I would be happy if I am given a chance to interview with the recruiting Manager."
"Johnson & Johnson has a very good impression in market because of their product quality and excellent marketing strategies. 

This could be very big platform for every candidate to get a chance working with J & J. about the recruitment process I can share my ideas like the company can do self-selection to find out who's really interested. Give them invitation for attend the interviews; check their ability, personality and behavior as well. 
"
"Johnson & Johnson has a stellar reputation. However, the recruitment process has been a tremendous disappointment. I am not expecting to be hired for every position I apply for, but I expect a certain amount of common courtesy.

For one position, I spoke with two recruiters, and each said they would recommend I interview with someone from the hiring department. I never received anything. Finally, after repeated calls and emails to the two recruiters, one said the position was filled.

On other positions I applied for and was clearly qualified and a match, I heard nothing. "
Johnson & Johnson falls into the same mold as many other companies with the recruitment process - they do not care about their applicants. Absolute atrocious application process as applicants do not hear back for months regarding their status. I believe I applied in January and did not hear back until April. 
"Johnson & Johnson doesn't give applicants a chance, they automatically deny you from the door even if you are qualified for the position. "
"Johnson & Johnson does not accept my resume for no reason. Every time I apply and even I feel I am qualified for the position, I do not hear any positive feedback which is very frustrating. J&J should make progress on keep candidate happy providing a feedback why the candidate is not eligible.

Thanks for your time.    "
"Johnson & Johnson could send a position status notification, even if it's just a 'thanks, but no thanks' email.  And if you really want to step it up, consider including something personal, e.g. While we were impressed by X, or you seem like a possible fit in another area, may we consider your application for other positions."
"Johnson & Johnson could improve their recruitment process by at least giving potential candidates a phone call to assess their potential positive merits for the company before neglecting to even send them a rejection letter.

I have never gotten a follow up call or even a rejection letter from J&J.  I would love the opportunity to speak with someone regarding my repeated applications.  I feel I would be an ideal fit with the J&J community, and I would provide excellent creativity and productivity to the J&J family."
Johnson & Johnson could improve the recruitment process by contacting candidates sooner. 
Johnson & Johnson could be more open to older candidates.
Johnson & Johnson could be more detail in the job description then a recruiter to give us updates on the recruitment process.
"Johnson & Johnson companies were high on my target employer list.  If no one contacts the applicant, how can we rate J&J highly as a prospective employer?"
Johnson & Johnson can reduce the online application. It's too long.

I was told to call if I need not hear within 3 - 5 business.  I left 2 voice messages and never heard from the recruiter either on the phone on email.  I understand there are many candidates that are considered, but if a recruiter commits to following up than he/she should do so.

"Johnson & Johnson can improve the communication process.. 

I went through a screening phone call this past February that lead to scheduling a second phone call. The screener gave me a range of dates (3-day range) to expect the second phone call and the hiring managers name. I did not receive the phone and followed up with an email to the screener. I have not received a response from the screener to date and the interview process ended. 

I would ask that J&J respond to emails within a reasonable time-frame and provide more details when scheduling interview/phone calls. 

One way J&J could provide improve upon this element of the process would be do something as simple as sending email event invites. I felt the process was a bit disorganized and was unsure of when/if I would be receiving a phone call from the hiring manager over the course of a few weeks. "
Johnson & Johnson can be more responsive and involved with the recruiting process.  I followed all of the necessary steps and contact was lost - without reason. 
"Johnson & Johnson can at least give a second chance to employees who were let go for no fault of their own.  I was a staff engineer at JNJ vision care and I did an excellent job while I was there but then got laid off in 2009 when the world-wide work force reduction occurred.  Since then I have applied about 100 positions over many years and I did not get even a phone call for an interview. I have been successful in the places I worked since I left JNJ. But what I feel that I could do much better job at JNJ the company I really liked to work for.

JNJ should always pick up some good candidates from its former laid off employees with good record.  Thanks."

Job was on hold for a long period of time.  I was more than qualified for the position however the hiring director was not comfortable with remote work.
"Job seekers take the time out to actively pursue and apply to positions.  The least the recruiters and managers can do is to give them adequate feedback if they are not a fit and when they commit to an interview, be on time and not rude about their attendance."
Job seekers hope to hear the reply anxiously.The recruiter have to contact the job seeker and give brief explanation why was the seeker's candidacy rejected.

JnJ should definitely asses the candidates resume but should also provide an opportunity to showcase their talent to the recruiter.
"JNJ recruitment process is not alinged with CREDO.  I have bid for ~50 jobs and did not get any response from any of the recruiter.  When I tried to reach out to find out the status, I received very rude response. "
"JNJ is the benchmark company for many competitors and business functions in the pharma sector, hence I see JNJ as the hallmark to follow and the motive to improve. This applies to their TA program, maybe a more personable and faster response will help to avoid whereabout and uncertainties on submission progress (technology exists, social media aids in reaching out faster!), which it's understandable for such a big, dynamic and complex corporation.

J'aimerais avoir plus de détails concernant le refus de ma candidature. 
"J&J used to hire based upon merit. I earned a Leadership award at the company during my tenure. J & J now seems to hire based upon if a Senior level job can sell a tv or a stereo. 

 Absolutely the most unprofessional interview  I have experienced in my 25-year medical device career and with one of the most respected companies in the medical business.  Such a disappointment.

I shall not be pursuing employment with Johnson & Johnson.  My recommendation to you is that your recruitment team or your Executive team needs to take a close look with your deficiencies internally first.  "
"J&J talent recruitment is biased and morale is too low at work place. Not sure why they even advertise postings, except but to disappoint the applicants. "
"J&J should treat the applicants with respect and provide timely feedback, even when they are not selected. The entire process is TOO SLOW. I have applied for a quite a few roles in the last couple of months and I have never heard back. I also have been referred by J&J Employees. Disappointing that a big and popular company like J&J is following this kind of practice. I interest level in J&J jobs has significantly decreased."
J&J should stop advertising for positions that they know quite well that outsiders might not get considered.
"J&J should review candidates more carefully. I am one of the most qualified and proven performers for the position that I applied for, but did not even get an interview. "
"J&J should respond to its applicants. I felt like I was ""ghosted""."
"J&J should provide a reason (or reasons) why I was not a good fit for the position I applied to, so I could improve my skills or apply for jobs more suitable for me."
"J&J should provide a customized feedback to those who are highly active applying for positions at J&J but are not able to go through the first phase. 

I applied several times (more than 70 probably) and I never got a phone call, that is really hard to understand when I have the right profile for a lot of positions. Probably I am doing some mistakes in my application (my CV or cover letter), but with several years experience and feedback from other companies, it is difficult to understand. I will appreciate some feedback about my applications in the future. Thank you."
J&J should know the cost of losing trained employees that want to continue in their carerr path
"J&J should have provided specific feedback regarding the decision of not being a good fit.  From the job description, it seems like my professional experience and education were a perfect match for the position.  However, I was never contacted by anyone, nor was a phone, online or face-to-face interview arrange in case the hiring manager had any questions on my background.

I have applied to a few position at J&J Vision Care and feel extremely disappointed of their recruiting process, so far."
"J&J should give more opportunities to the people that don't have the experience in pharmaceuticals. This way, J&J will have a better chance to know the talents of the person which may have and can be suitable to J&J."
J&J should consider the background of candidates who have worked in a pharmaceutical environment and consider them as potential candidates. I have applied for years for a direct position having worked as a contractor and have never been given the opportunity to interview yet I have worked in a pharmaceutical environment for over 20 years.
J&J should actually respond to applicants!
"J&J recruitment process is very intuitive and objective. Althoug I've not passed to the next stage, I believe that your process is great considering the number of professionals who compete for their positions."
J&J recruitment could follow up on job status to let the applicant know whether or not they have been selected for the interview process or not.   I never heard back after I applied for 2 positions.
"J&J recruiters should make some personnal contact with people that applied for some position, even if the candidate didn´t match job requirements.
This feedback, negative or positive, should be happenin order to candidates understand how the recruitment process worked.
Thanks a lot,"
J&J process seems fine.
J&J never gives us response back on application which i applied for. I have applied for several positions but no one ever tried to contact me or shared feedback with me. 
"J&J need to follow up with each applicant no only if they are qualified but when they are not qualified.  

I never heard wether or not I was qualified or not."
"J&J Made a big splash in providence. Even invited me to this special event. However at the event contact was limited to ""call me on Monday"" type stuff.  When called I felt strung along as if there wasnt interest in my skills. Id frequently receive rejections from j&j automated emails as positions I'd applied for filled but never a call from a recruiter. No reasons for no engagement were ever given.  It's like I was being held on the bench with no clear way to get in the game. I stopped calling the recruiter and this survey will be the last time i engage with j&j  good luck"
"J&J is well known as a large, successful, diversified corporation. I suggest you fight the reputation of being cold and inhuman. Your hiring process has a reputation of being cold, inhuman and unforgiving.
Stop relying on an ATS to screen candidates. Candidates may be incredibly skilled and an excellent match, but are filtered out by an AI that has had questionable programming or because the candidates resume didn't have the requisite keywords or was formatted in a way that could not be understood by the AI. 
Either way, J&J loses opportunities to bring on talented people.
Use people to hire people. My candidiacy was an excellent match for the req"
J&J is the only company that would spend some time to reply to my application telling me that I'm not the best fit for the position I'm applying. That really makes me felt that the company is trying its best to respect every applicants. It's a pity that I couldn't work with J&J yet but I will try to apply again once there is a proper opening for me. thanks!
"J&J is the creme de la creme of companies. It would seem that the reputation and brand attracts top talent. I worked for J&J while a consultant at PwC. I was impressed with the company and enjoyed the culture and employees very much. 

In terms of the process, I think the online portion was fairly straightforward with no issues. I have to wonder about the job description and the candidates and competition - in my case I thought is was a good match in terms of skills and experience. I do a lot of recruiting myself, and I can say that those high on the list (at least the top 10) always get an initial call from me as the first screen for cultural fit, experience, and communication skills. While a 30 minute conversation does not allow one to make a final decision, it always provides good insight into the person and whether I should invite them in for further consideration. 

I am not aware of J&J's training and how talent is managed - however, I think it is a good practice to be proactive and engaging if the candidate warrants it. 

J&J is a great company and I hope to work there someday! "
"J&J is one of the few companies which I have aspired to work with for a very long time, especially because I have grown up with acknowledging the company.

But having been rejected application after application without an opportunity to interview, gives me an impression that J&J does not want to hire and have diversity in talent. They just want the best experienced individuals regardless of them having accomplished by hook or by crook.

"
J&J is one of the companies I wanted to work for a long time so the above rating is not based on the recruitment process. 
"J&J is not timely about alerting candidates to the outcome of their search process.  I applied to a position in June, and was not informed that i hadn't been selected until April of the next year.  This timeline was extremely extended, and there had been no communication in the middle.  "
J&J is missing the chance to get valuable candidates without a chance to get an interview. I feel frustrated.
J&J is massively successful.  It shows. 
J&J is a world wide best class reputation corporation; I guess we all in the industry will love an opportunity at J&J.
"J&J is a target company I have wanted to work for several years based on it's human rights practices and it's global presence with their diverse product line helping out millions of people everyday.  However, I would like to acknowledge that I was not contacted about this positon and I applied online.  It would be interesting to understand more about your HR recruiting processes, and how it could be more beneficial to extract candidates that do have a passion for people and healthcare companies.  "
"J&J is a huge company with great history in helping to treat patients, and as I highly consider this company as one of the top , I could say that that the HR better to explain why somebody does not fit the job requirements.
At the end I would like to say that every one should be proud to be part of your company."
"J&J is a great company with fantastic reputation in the industry. As a result, the interview process should be more candidate friendly (such as timely feedback) to reflect the same high standards. 

Yours truly. "
"J&J has been amongst the best companies in the world for generations and should set very high standards in everything it does, including the recruitment process.

Please make the recruitment process as humane and transparent as possible.

Thanks for asking."
"J&J has a very candidate friendly, welcoming feel when contacting candidates who have been sought out by J&J and retained recruiters.  However, despite my best efforts, it is very challenging for qualified candidates to make initial contact with J&J.  Is there any way to improve how candidates can find / gain access to the talent pool?  Many communications are initiated via email to managers, sometimes executives, who may not have time to properly absorb and reply.  Could these emails be ""forwarded"" to your talent pool and then followed up directly with the prospective candidate?  - just a thought.  Good day."
"J&J has a good name, and I've heard that even people in China respect their products.  I was not contacted or told anything about my application."
J&J does not respond to very well to applicants. I have applied for numerous positions and I only receive a standard response despite the fact I have 20 years of diverse experience.
"J&J does not communicate about recruitment process. While other pharmas are more transparent about their expectations and the recruitment is a two ways discussions to see if there could be a fit, J&J only sends generic messages which discourage about J&J HR's respect to talents.
"
"J&J does a very bad job with follow up regarding internal candidates (I am sure it is worse for external).  I can’t believe that I am receiving a survey for a position that I applied for but was never contacted about?  I love J&J and hope to work here a long time but, the HR and recruiting is pretty rough."
"J&J did not get back to me for months. To quote a certain President, ""Not good"". And finally no reason as to why I was not a good fit... although I am and would have made a great employee."
"J&J could provide some actual feedback, instead of only sending form rejection letters."
J&J could provide more feedback to applicants
"J&J could pay for my hotel room for starters.  I was never reimbursed or offered reimbursement for lodging or out of pocket expenses due to travel associated with the interview.

I live in Detroit and was required to drive to Indianapolis (295 miles or over four and a half hours from my house by car).  Had I known I would be required to pay out of pocket for my hotel room I might have declined the interview. 

Honestly, I've never heard of anything like that.  Genentech and Astra Zeneca sent me a form when they interviewed locally that applied to people who travelled from out of town for the interview.  They reimbursed expenses for anyone travelling more than 3 hours away.

The manager, Greg Williams, couldn't even be bothered to respond to my email to let me know that none of my out of pocket expenses would be covered.  

All I was looking for was reimbursement for my hotel which is fair and standard operating procedure I would think for most large pharmaceutical companies."
"J&J could make an effort to provide a better, mature and honest feedback  concerning the reason why a candidate was not well fited for the position he/she applied to."
"J&J career page did not mention that video interview was first step in the hiring process and career web page needs to be updated to mention this important piece of information.  My PC does not have camera (I do not Skye) and there was no alternative way for me to record my video interview.  Please provide a  phone interview as alternative to video interview because not every person has the latest electronic equipment. I'm very surprise that J&J would not have a alternative way for people to be interview if they did not have cameras and seems that J&J does not care (because there must a lot of people applying for positions and this is one way of ""weeding out"" job applicants).  My is name: Ed Clark-732-247-1023 call me if you have any questions. "
J&J can respond to all application as soon as possible even if the answer is negative.
"J&J can interview their potential employees. I never been interviewed in person or by telephone for this role. My survey is a little bias because J&J has never reached out to me, although my skills and experience should have at a minimum awarded me an interview. "
"J&J can improve the recruitment process not sending me the same survey several times, but offering me a job interview or a job position!
Thank you."
"J&J can improve recruitment by using local recruiters and post ads in local newspaper or jobs websites.   The Athens area has highly qualified talent in the area so holding a jobs fair would be beneficial to the company and the community.
"
"J&J advertised a position that was not available (at all or at least for my school).

I never got interviewed and somehow got a notice from J&J that my profile did not fit your needs. this process was just so disorganized. I was truly disappointed at J&J."
J and J could have updated me in a more timely fashion.  They contacted me about 6 months after I applied to a position.
J + J needs to add a personal interview not just a phone call interview. I being in person to person interview with supervisor and directors and is more complete and you are talking with the person in charge of the area. Thanks.
"J & J should stop recruiting by appointment and ex-employees and should read professional resume carefully.
Indications, only have value, if and only if, the person who indicated is responsible for the performance of the indicated.
But this is the behavior of an organization with a refined management system.
I am completely disappointed with J & J selective process and talent acquisition."
J & J is a great company.   Not sure why I was looking at job descriptions with 4 or 5 sentences  The goal of an interview is to align experience to  position which would have been much easier if the job descriptions were thorough and provided in advance
"ive not heard from the recruiter ever.
he must speak to me in ordde to proceed."
"Ive applied for a job, I'll be happy to help you improve if my prime motive is looked after . I have no idea what ever happened to my application. I can guess of course , but I shouldn't have to. "
"Its nice and respectful if they come back to the applicant and explain why they are not going forward with their resume. Giving a feed back will help the other applicants to improve their resume. If they put a bit of time, just like the applicants who put time and filled out all  the steps, it makes really a good interaction, even if they don't hire that person. 

Also, thank you for preparing this survey! 

"
"Its funny that you sent me a survey when all i got was an automated response of not being considered for my online application. There was no call, no interview nothing so basically your survey process is flawed"
Its all good at the moment. 
"Its all about communication during the interview process. I'm yet to see consistency across the board that informs applicants on where they stand during the hiring process. Please strive to improve that process. for example, i applied to this position, didn't get any information and now Im completing a survey and I was never informed or contacted on why I was not a good fit for the role."
Its a little awkward that I got this email before I was notified I was no longer considered for the position. So any communication from the recruiter would have been better.
"Its a joke..interview and no call back as to why I didn't get picked and being a consultant for the company and being as knowkedage doesn't count because ITLDPs always get the higher priority 

I have applied for almost 200 jobs seriously "
"It's very frustrating to apply to a position and spend a significant amount of time doing so just to be lost in translation to the automated system. I was qualified for this position and could of become an asset to the team however as with most on line application processes, my application seemed to be either overlooked or just disregarded. I know you have endless applicants for these positions however there needs to be an improvement to the requisition process so that qualified candidates don't slip through the cracks. Additional questionnaires could be helpful and honestly, if a candidate is qualified, an actual answer as to why you opted to go in a different direction would benefit both parties. The candidate so that he/she can understand if it was a fit or experience issue and the company so that you aren't inundated with applicants endlessly trying for anything and everything just to get in. "
"It's still not very clear whether or not I'm still being
considered for this position.
I'm confused.

Seems like filling out this survey is more
important than explaining the process ... 
next steps? if any."
It's really hard to change the process. I believe that once someone has a candidate in mind for the job no one else stands a chance. It's a waste of time to interview. 
"It's rather discouraging to submit an application and not receive a response notifying you of the status.  It would be helpful if the applicant could receive a call, email or even link that could show you where your applicant stands in the process"
It's one of the best Organisation pertaining to Recruitment Processes 
It's one of my favourite companies and brands. I like your products a lot. I'm glad I get to tell you.
"It's obvious that J&J is not serious about hiring outside talent but rather hiring friends and family.  In order to comply with EOE, J&J interviews outside talent with no sincere intention.  "
It's nice to hear back if you are no longer a candidate.
It's impossible to land a job opportunity without mounting a campaign to find out who the hiring team is and getting extensive line of leadership involved to support said campaign
"It's honestly bad. You're missing out on talent because the data you are processing with regards to resumes and applications is filtering out qualified applicants. Every position I applied for I was qualified for, I wasn't shooting for the stars, I applied for things I have done and have been successful in. Not to mention applicants can apply and hear nothing from anyone or anything for very extended periods of time. I get you have a lot of applicants but you are missing out on people that you should absolutely be calling back for secondary screens. "
It's highly important to receive feedback after cv submitted 
It's hard to gauge selection criteria when you don't hear back on any positions you have applied for.
"It's funny that I don't receive 'application rejection' but I receive survey of asking my experience.

I think I would personally like J&J more, if I could have a feedback of my application before doing this survey."
It's fine.
"It's disheartening when a person spends time preparing, gets his|her hopes up, has a phone interview and then doesn't hear anything in the way of decision or feedback. It portrays the company as completely unprofessional and uncaring. I won't be applying for any future postings because of the way I have been dismissed without explanation for jobs I was completely qualified for. One can only surmise there is much nepotism taking place and to comply with EO laws, a certain few are interviewed from outside with no sincere intention of offering employment."
"It's difficult for me to say this - but I have very competitive qualifications and wish to transition out of management consulting into industry - bringing skills that you typically have to acquire from Accenture or Deloitte for $200+ per hr - and I can't get the J&J Recruiting community to even acknowledge my presence.

It's proof that online recruiting is very difficult to manage effectively."
"It's difficult for me to respond to this given that my involvement in the recruitment process has been limited.  In terms of the employment application process, I believe that the job postings clearly establish the expectations and standards for the positions I've reviewed, and the online application process is user-friendly.  "
"It's better to have a following up within a reasonable frame of time and in case there is not preselection, it's helpful to the candidate to know the reason(S).

Thank you."
It's been soooo long since my notification. Asking questions now wasted mine and your time.
It's always nice to hear maybe a few reasons why one was not selected.
"It's always nice to hear from a person. I only received an email. As a marketing professional with 10 plus years of brand marketing experience, it's always nice to learn why you are not being considered for a position."
It's already doing a great job 
"It's a great process,l though I did not receive a call from a recruiter. "
It's a great company.
It's a great company  
"It's a business; I'm not sure if most applicants like myself that are seriously trying to secure a career with a company understand that. I understand that if you feel my skill sets match the criteria of the position, you will contact me. If not, you choose a candidate whom you feel is better suited. I'll just keep applying until I get what I'm looking for. "
It'd be nice to be contacted at some point besides a post-app survey. This survey  was the only contact I received. 
It would've been great to get feedback from a recruiter about why I wasn't chosen for a position or to have some feedback about positions that would be a better fit.
"It would seems that Johnson and Johnson has a surplus of applicants applying for the positions or their is a complete lack of follow up.  I continually get requests for surveys on the hiring process for the company, however the same due diligence is not applied to contacting the applicant in regards to the position for which they applied."
It would really be nice to receive communication regarding if I'm not chosen to move forward in the process. 
"It would make searching for jobs much easier if we could search jobs by city, by date posted, etc.  Also, it would be wonderful if you could include what a particular position's level is in the job description.  If you could search jobs by level, that would be the most helpful.

I have received a note that the application was received, but only receive a survey when the job has been filled (I assume that means I was not considered for the job)."
It would helpful if they responded to candidates and gave feedback.  There are a lot of strong candidates looking for jobs that are lost in this process.  Be open to talented people with diverse skill sets and backgrounds.  
It would help if I can get a formal rejection on positions that I applied for instead of not getting a response at all. I have heard about a few positions I applied for in 4 months. That is just not called for and I didn't like that most companies would give me a response within 1 max 2 months.
"It would have been professional if someone had bothered to contact me to let me know that I was not being considered for the position.

This was not a low level position and it should have been attended to with more consideration that was given.

I am quite surprised and disappointed in the handling of the situation.

Thomas Blaney"
It would have been nice to understand why my 20 years of experience in data management within a global environment at a competing pharmaceutical company was not a fit for your company. 
"It would have been nice to receive feedback on why I did not move to the next phase of intereviewing. I received no feedback.
Thank you"
"It would have been nice to hear from someone. To know why I wasn't a good fit for the job. I never even got a chance to interview. And my resume looked like it fit perfectly with the job description. 

If I could know why I wasn't a good fit, it would help me in my career search going forward. "
"It would have been nice to hear back from someone personally, though I understand this is likely unreasonable due to the number of applicants you receive."
It would have been nice to discuss my background in this industry with the hiring manager.  
"It would have been nice to be notified of the status of my application, whether or not I was a favorable candidate before taking this survey. "
"It would have been nice to at least get a thanks, but no thanks email"
"It would have been nice to actually been interviewed for the position before being callously informed via an informal email that I wasn't chosen.  With over 15 years and most recently more than 11+ years as an Executive Assistant to the President of a division at Universal Pictures a major motion picture studio, my experience and skills meets the basic qualifications and then some required for the position.  I am very discouraged that your recruiters are rejecting candidates without even interviewing them first.  Even with this set back, I still believe that Johnson and Johnson would be an incredible opportunity and will still continue to review job openings in the future."
It would have been nicd to speak to a recruiter
"It would have been helpful to receive feedback as to why I was not selected for the position, and/or how I can improve for future interviews.  I completely understand if there is no useful feedback, but after having gone through the entire interview process I would hope for something more than a ""you are no longer being considered for this position"" email."
"It would have been helpful to let employees know that the internal site has been updated. I've been contacted with surveys about jobs I never heard back from and now have jobs I've never applied to in my ""cart"".  

For this particular position here, there was no contact except for an automated rejection notice, but the 8 positions remain posted. Would have been nice to have received some more personalized feedback. "
It would have been helpful to have a phone interview with HR instead of just receiving a rejection letter more than 2 months after I applied.  
It would have been great to have received some communication regarding my status as a candidate. The email regarding the survey is the first communication I received
"It would have been beneficial to at least receive an email stating that I was not being considered for the position. Understanding that there was probably a large pool of applicants, even a standard response would have been better than not hearing anything. When applying I thought it was a bit of a stretch, so I am not too concerned with not being considered. "
It would be very useful if a live human being were available to discuss opportunities and respond to questions
It would be of great convenience if JnJ would advise of application status.
It would be nice to understand why you don't qualify for a position verses a general statement.  
It would be nice to say / indicate what were the weaknesses or why you were not selected. 
It would be nice to receive some notice that the position was filled. I received no information other than looking on JJEDS and seeing a person with the job description title was now listed under the hiring manager.   Also there was a 2nd position open which I am not sure if I am being considered for or will need to go through the interview process again or if that position was also filled.  Its disappointing being a J&J employee that you aren't even given the courtesy of an email saying the position was filled after completing several interviews. Its known that the process moves slowly but getting no response or update just leaves you wondering if it was filled or are they still interviewing?
"It would be nice to receive information more frequently during the process, even if it's just an Email saying ""the process is ongoing, you are still in consideration""."
It would be nice to receive feedback 
It would be nice to receive a response positive or negative with a more personal touch. 
It would be nice to receive a communication regarding the fact that one I did not receive the position before receiving a communication asking me to complete a survey regarding our thoughts on the J&J process.
"It would be nice to know you are not being considered sooner. Why are people so afraid to take the time tell the applicant ""no"". It's better than hearing nothing. Not everyone is going to be banging down your door asking for feedback."
It would be nice to know why I wasn't a fit for the position and what I can do become more of an ideal candidate for Johnson and Johnson.
It would be nice to know why I was not considered for this position.  Being able to have a conversation with a recruiter would help me decide if employment with Johnson & Johnson is a good fit for me at this point in my career.
It would be nice to know what you could do to improve and possibly land a job at Johnson & Johnson.
It would be nice to know what skills kept me from getting even considered for the position.
It would be nice to know the reason or some info.  That will help candidate knows what do and don't and be able to make things/process more efficient for both Johnson's and her/himself.
"It would be nice to know that an actual individual reviewed my resume and not an automatic search engine.   I feel that you may be missing viable and strong candidates who have extensive experience.
thank you"
It would be nice to know if the position was filled so candidates can move on.
"It would be nice to just attach a resume and answer any pertinent questions that are required to be reviewed for screening. The current process of attaching a resume and then regurgitating the information by filling out work, education and skill history is redundant and unnecessary."
It would be nice to hear from the recruiter as to why the candidate is not a good fit. Also would be nice to be notified when J&J will be holding a job fair.
It would be nice to hear from someone.  
"It would be nice to hear from a human, not by email, why I wasn't even considered for a position that I was very qualified to fill. "
It would be nice to hear back from someone regardless whether the candidate is a good fit or not. 
"It would be nice to hear a reason why the applicant was not a good fit for the position. However, applicants would like to at least hear back from the employer, one way or another. That way the applicant has closure and not wondering whether or not he was even in the running or basically discarded after the first review. "
"It would be nice to have more transparency into the process.  I'm curious how you can get a rejection letter a few days after applying, yet the position shows as actively recruiting several weeks later.  Or perhaps showing # applicants at each stage."
It would be nice to have more communication
"It would be nice to have a more personalized interaction, as I am still very interested in joining this team for its commitment to innovation, quality and excellence."
It would be nice to have a level of contact with the recruiters and learn the reason why an application has not been considered.
"It would be nice to get more frequent updates on the status of the position.
I never hear anything."
It would be nice to get information on application deficiencies so that an applicant can learn how to improve their prospects of getting hired.
It would be nice to get feedback regarding the reason for not advancing the the hiring process. 
It would be nice to be contacted whether I am going forward or not. Thanks.
"It would be nice to always hear a one sentence email letting us know why the candidature had a short fall. I usually apply only when there is a 80-85% match with the job description so some feedback will always help deciding about opportunities going forward. 
Thank you for listening. 

Best regards, 

Rahul Dantu  "
"It would be nice to actually relate to another person, at least once in the process. The automated rejections based on key-word resume scanning leaves little in the way of clues on what should have been on the resume to elicit a response. "
It would be nice to able to view my other applications in process and what their status is.
It would be nice receive a phone call explaining why I was not the best fit
It would be nice if you provided more feedback on why you are not the right fit for the position. I have applied for many jobs I have all the qualification for but never receive any feedback.  It would be nice to know what I am doing wrong or am missing so that I have a shot. It feels like I have been applying for nothing.
It would be nice if you could get an answer especially when you take time to prepare and spends hours on site interviewing.  Not to hear anything back is extremely disappointing and confirms the fact that J & J uses outside candidates to fill there quotas for checking the box for the candidate pool just to turn around and hire the internal candidate they wanted to fill the position.  Don't waste your time with J & J.    
It would be nice if work experience counted. I would only recommend J&J to university graduates. 
"It would be more helpful if applicants knew why they were not selected. Many times I would not receive feedback at all when I applied to a position. J&J used to be one of the top companies I wanted to work for, but going through the process showed I was simply another number in the pool."
It would be more efficient for applicants if you did  not post jobs that didn't exist at the time of the application.  
"It would be lovely to be contacted by a recruiter or to receive any constructive feedback about why I was not called for an interview. As of this date, I cannot be sure that a human being has even viewed my application."
It would be kind for someone to have contacted me regarding the position. Thank you
"It would be helpful to receive more feedback in regards to why one was not a good fit for the position rather than just that there was a better qualified applicant. 
 "
"It would be helpful to receive a point of contact for follow ups, after applying to an online position."
It would be helpful to know why I was not selected.
It would be helpful to know the reasons for not being considered for a position
It would be helpful to know the reason why the applicant is rejected after submitting an application for a job. 
"It would be helpful to hear from a recruiter as to why the applicant was not a good fit, I understand that this would be time-consuming, but if it were at all possible, I think it would be beneficial to hear constructive criticism. I, unfortunately, did not hear from anyone. I received an email stating that Johnson and Johnson that they were pursuing other candidates. 

Thank you, 
Megan"
It would be helpful to hear back from a recruiter.
"It would be helpful to get immediate notification, within 3 business days,  if the hiring manager is certain you are not a candidate they will be moving forward with.  To complete the interview process and not receive any type of feedback until weeks later can be very discouraging for someone, particularly if you are a candidate that is unemployed and actively seeking placement."
It would be helpful to get an email regarding the position and what phase of the recruitment process I am in.  I normally just receive surveys and I am not sure if this is an indicator that I did not get the position.
It would be helpful if the recruiter would contact the applicant as soon as possible after the applicant has been removed from consideration.
It would be helpful if J&J would provide some form of entry foe individuals highly interested in entering the field for which they are applying for if they do not possess the level of experience or credentials on paper. Many individuals are qualified and possess the aptitude to perform at a high level but lack the number of years in the industry they are applying for.
"It would be helpful if eligible candidates were contacted personally, and even granted an interview."
It would be helpful for both J&J and potential employees if recruiters were experienced in the field of which they are recruiting. It is possible that well-qualified applicants are not interviewed because their application/CV was missing key words that the recruiter was seeking. A recruiter with experience in the field of which they are recruiting would be able to recognize some of the terms and skills that may be different but substitutive of the key words they seek and may highlight the same skills or experiences as those key works.
"It would be great to understand why a candidate was not a fit and if they have a certain set of skills that are viable to a company, the recruiter should provide alternative options.  J&J is an amazing company but it seems like the candidate experience could be improved."
"It would be great to receive consistent information regarding the status of your application. I didn't receive a status but several requests for a survey on the recruitment process. At this point I still have not received any information regarding the application.  I have applied for multiple positions and the communications are sporadic, meaning I receive an email sometimes and sometimes not."
"It would be great to know where I stood throughout the recruitment process and would be helpful if I was aware of when interviews might occur, when decisions, would be made by, and if I did not get the position, if applicable. For most application processes, the applicant is left in the dark"
It would be great to have an actual human being interact with me instead of form letter emails.
It would be great to get an interview. 
It would be great just to have follow up.  Even if it is a quick phone call or email to allow prospective employees know that the hiring process is haulted.  Would also love to be considered for further opportunities.
"It would be great if the recruiter could contact and provide a reason as to why I was not a good fit for the position I applied to.  I am eager for an opportunity to join the Johnson & Johnson team, and would definitely work towards any additional requirements that can provide me with an opportunity to meet with the recruiter."
"It would be great if someone provided feedback on the interview process, delay in feedback, and/or why you weren't chosen. The only information I received was an automated rejection. NO ONE followed up.  "
It would be great if J&J would share more opportunities with appliers and provide chances for us to get an interview in the furtrue.
It would be great if I knew the reason that why I was not selected at the first place.
It would be great if candidates were able to track the application through the hiring process even if that includes excluding the candidate early on in the process.  
It would be great if applicants receive feedback on their application
It would be great if a recruiter can actually take a second and review a potential employee skills.  Here I am with an MBA and have applied for many position but was told that I was not even qualified for an executive assistant position.  I have a very diverse background with over 20+ years of experience but still not enough to get a call from HR.  It just very disappointed. I feel the new HR system does not give people like me a chance to be an employee at JNJ.  I will not give up and will continue to apply as I still think very highly of Johnson & Johnson.
"It would be good to let the candidate know in what areas of skill or knowledge the recruiter find the candidate not matching the requirements, if that is the main reason for the rejection."
It would be good to know why you didn't meet the requirement for an initial screening.  I have the skillset to do this job as well as the one for the Human Performance Institute which was posted last year.  It seems like J&J doesn't go beyond pharma experience to pull talented people.
It would be good to know the reason for not selecting a candidate or feedback on improvement.
It would be good to have quick feedback and consider the diversity.
It would be good to have better list of questionair available to get an idea how best skills could meet for submission 
"It would be good to get periodic updates on the progress of a candidate's application. According to my experience, the application is send off and an automated reply is then received and then there is no update whatsoever from the recruitment team on the progress of the application. This just leaves a candidate wondering what has happened so far.
It would be good to have a more ""personalised"" experience wherein a candidate actually hears from a member of the recruiting team after the automated reply.
It would also be good to have the personalised experience extended to when an application is not successfully so the candidate can engage in some kind of dialogue to get feedback on the reasons and work on them for next time.
For me so far the application just gets lost in a void with no news for weeks and then another automated reply that my application was not successful."
It would be good to get notification that you were considered and wasn't a good fit.
It would be effective for recruiters to pass along the resumes to the hiring managers.  I have worked with recruiters in my previous roles and noticed that often they don't understand the lingo in the job experience in a resume and pass along good candidates because they don't understand what the lingo means compared to the job descriptions.  
"It would be considerate to let the applicant know that their application was at least given some consideration.
Johnson and Johnson has a very good reputation but this application process is extremely impersonal and leaves you wondering if the materials sent were ever even viewed. I have over the past several years applied responded to quite a few postings, some I undoubtedly was not the best suited applicant and others for which I probably was over qualified. Anecdotally I have never heard of anyone who was hired as a result of this process but as my skill set and work experience increase I will probably continue to apply for postings that match my interests. I have a strong educational background and varied work experience.   "
It would be better if provide the reason that not qualified for the position.
It would be better if more information were provided about why the application was not sufficient 
it would be best if the recruiter replies back with the reason as to why my application was not considered
It would be beneficial if you did this survey sooner. I can't really remember specifically the interaction I had with your recruiter.  It was basically an email or two (form letter/email). No other contact. 
It would be appreciated if the recruiter would get back to the candidate either way to advise as to the status of her application.
It would be appreciated even though I am aware of the high volume of new candidates to at least see a email or a call why I was not selected.  You guys should have the habilita that if a candidate is not selected offer alternatives if any of employment with the enterprise. 
"It will you helpful if you can offer some suggestions regarding to which area could be better, such as resume etc."
It will help if the recruiter has a little bit more info on the territory and availability. 
It will be nice to have updates during the process.  I applied for a few position within the past 2-3 weeks but I do not know if J&J is still interested in my in the position that I applied for with J&J. 
It will be great to have a more personalized process. 
It will be great if we get atleast opportunity to talk with recruiting manager or recruiter.
It will be great if J&J could provide update for the recruiting process at least monthly. It's hard to followup with the recruiter and HM after the onsite interview and I did not get any feedback since the interview (over one month ago).
It was weeks after I applied before getting any response. I had already moved on to more responsive opportunities.
It was very typical of a large global company. Don't call us we'll call you. 
It was very clear that the one person in the second interview had her mind made up before I came in.  It was also clear she was the ultimate decision maker.  It would have been appreciated if my time was valued enough to not bring me in again on short notice if the hiring decision maker was already of a mind that I did not satisfy qualifying requirements.
"It was over 4 weeks from the time I applied online, submitted a cover letter and resume that I heard anything back. The only correspondence was an email informing me that I was not being considered any longer for the position. More prompt response would be appreciated, as well as feedback regarding my qualifications and a possible fit elsewhere. "
It was hard for me to complete this survey since I was not given the opportunity to interview for the position.  After reaching out I was provided with an explanation but I still struggled to understand why that was the case based on the job description and my qualifications.  Generally I have been disappointed with how internal candidates are treated - I think we owe our current employees a better and more personalized experience including detailed feedback.
It was disappointing to be rejected for the position but even more disappointing was not having specific information as to why and what could be done to improve future successful applications.
It was all very electronic and mechanical.  I never spoke to anyone.
"It was a sterile experience and left me with the impression that J&J would not provide a good work environment.  The recruiter was awol after the first contact - I think he is measured by submissions and not successful placements.  A common mistake for small companies, I expect more from you.  I went through this twice with your company, gave feedback both times and no changes.  Looks like it is just an exercise."
It was a good process with good leadership.
It was 5-6 months before I heard anything regarding my application.  The process would have been better with more communication.
It was 2 months before I even received a reply.  I've worked in Pharma for over 10 years and never had that happen
It took to long for answering if I was going to be eligible.
"It took comically long to get any response, so long that I had forgotten that I had an active application and had already accepted a new position months ago."
"It took a long time - communicate throughout the process if it is going to take a long time.  

I was only notified through a standard form letter of denial without any specifics.  Please, if you care enough to send a survey, be more personal with your communication and give some reasons as to why I was not a fit.  

Thanks."
It took 6 weeks from application to receive an email that my candidacy was going to be pursued.  Any contact at all from J&J would be better than this.
It too so long to get an email back.  It would be great to let me know if I wasn't considered for in the interview rather than wait until the position is filled.
It takes too long to hear a response.  Sometimes I never receive a reply.  I never know why I was passed over when I meet or exceed all of the qualifications.  I am wondering if age discrimination is operative.
"It should be more transparent , eligible candidate at least should have one chance to prove him/her self via face to face interaction, rather than pre-recorded video call."
It should be great if they can save our resume and let us know if there is something match with our experience and our backgrounds
It seems your HR dept is run by a bunch of jokers.
"It seems that the process relies heavily on computer generated outcomes to responses, rather than analytically looking at someone's experience and seeing how diversity of professional experience might actually be a strong fit for roles. "
"It seems no matter how qualified J&J only hires from within or for much younger and those with less industry experience.  I will not spend time looking at J&J any longer.  Oddly, many, many qualified people I know feel the same way.  You simply are not interested in people that are very qualified.  I really do not understand why.
"
It seems difficult to get a resume to the hiring managers eyes. 
It ok like that.
it nothing much that J & J can do to improve. as per my opinion its perfect as the recruitment process.
It needs to ease out the process and should be able to attract PhD holders 
It must be transparent in a timely manner. A top candidate was rejected w/o explanation or follow-ups. It took 4 months w/o explanation of delay
It might expedito te process
"It might be nice to be contacted BEFORE I'm sent the automated e-mail stating that I wasn't selected for the position, and THEN send a survey asking me how I thought the interview process went. Come on, people."
It may help to get SMS about hiring decision  because we may miss particular communication in many related emails.
it may be helpful to place less emphasis on the computer prescreening and more emphasis on the actual candidate and resume. it is possible to be missing out on more than qualified candidates by basing sections on trying to fit into a computerized selection process
"It is well known that big companies like J&J like to hire people with a certain years of experience. Recent graduates are likely to have either some or not at all experience. So in order to get the experience, how is people are supposed to do that without having an opportunity? You better start at first by saying in an explicit way that the job entry is NOT for entry level people."
"It is very important to keep complete transparency in this process, especially for internal employees.  The feedback is a valuable input in the employee's development process.  What will an employee think when he received the automated email for a position for which he is more than qualified and was not even consider for an interview at least?  And had to request an explanation wondering for why he/she was not even considered for the position and receive later as the explanation that the hiring manager preferred to hire somebody from the EMEA region, when the posting from the position stated the following: ""Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a member of Johnson & Johnson's Family of Companies, is recruiting for a MAKE Q&C Validation and CSV Practice Lead, to be located in any J&J Manufacturing site within North America or EMEA Region – including US, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Canada and Zug Switzerland.""  After all this an employee will think that the process is completely biased and the posting of position is only to comply with a policy.  Sorry... but to bad for the J&J Credo."
"It is very good, didn't find a job yet though"
It is the best... No improvements are required.
It is the best place to work in the world
"It is surprising that I continue to get the survey when I have received no news from J&J and had notified the issue earlier to the HR representative. 

Regarding the role itself, I was bit surprised not hearing back as I have over 10 years of program/ project experience and 20 years of working with Fortune 500 companies. I have led programs/ projects and have helped some of the leading American corporates improve the business processes. 

I am sure that the short-listed/ selected candidates are well deserving and had required qualification but the automated nature of communication (or lack of) makes me unsure if the application, resume and profile were even reviewed."
"It is ridiculous for J&J to turn down, time after time, a highly qualified high functioning professional such as myself without ever having talked with me.  How can you possibly accept my resume and not finding it a good idea to talk with someone as qualified as myself.  "
It is really friendly and easy to use it
"It is odd that I am receiving a survey about a position which I applied for but did not receive any communication whatsoever.  I did go through the interview process 18 months ago for a different position, however, there was zero communication regarding this position - Director, Field Operations - Oncology (Horsham, PA) - Janssen Biotech, Inc. (8286160504).  

My only feedback for this specific position what through the Talent Community profile.  "
It is obvious your company isn't serious about merit based recruiting.
"It is my considered opinion that recruiting for mechanical technicians would be better served by considering applicants who have prior experience working at Johnson & Johnson and who have assisted on change overs with the mechanical technicians to the degree that some of us have done. I myself graduated from the Mechatronics program at  the Lanc. County career & technology center with the AMIST 1 certification in the hope of returning to J&J after being put on layoff after six years at J&J in Lititz,Pa in 2008, it is my wish to be employed at J&J again in any capacity that would become available to me, yet as to the recruitment process, I believe that it be most beneficial to J&J to consider those who loved working at J&J and know what a great company J&J is. Those of us who want to be employed at J&J again after being put on layoff would greatly appreciate it and be of great benefit to J&J."
"It is interesting that I was not even contacted for a phone screen, since I met all the requirements for the position and I was displaced by the acquisition of Synthes by J&J."
"It is hard to reach out to every individual who applied to a position and I understand that cannot be done all the time. However, there have been quite a few job postings for which I am a good fit and there is no interest. "
"It is good, may not required further improvisition"
It is good that an applicant receives feedback on whether they made the 1st cut or not. But it's not enough...maybe let them know why?
"It is difficult to state how the process could be improved since there has not been any feedback other than an email stating that I was not selected for the position, and the receipt of two surveys, Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to speak with any hiring manager(s) within the organization.

"
"It is beneficial as a candidate to know the reason for not landing on a position that she/he applied to.

Calling for an interview and providing feed back are always welcome.


"
"It is basic courtesy to respond to an applicant, and J&J's recruitment team is yet to contact me - either by email or by phone. "
It is always desirable to glean information from the recruiter when a job cannot be offered to a candidate. 
"It is a highly competitive market out.  Thank you for your time in reviewing the application.

It is a good process.
"It has been my dream for several years now to work at Johnson and Johnson. (So much of the mission and culture alignes perfectly with my own value system). I'm a MD,MPH; and everytime I earn a degree, certificate, skill, or more experience I visit J&J webpage and I am back applying to my area of expertise. I apply to the positions I'm most talented and recognized for. I get a generic email that doesn't offer a job interview.
Though I am often head hunted by recruiters for my unique experience and skill set.  I have declined similar positions to the ones I apply for at J&J at other pharmaceuticals. The only way I would leave my current job would be to join Johnson and Johnson family. 
I almost get the feeling that the generic responses are robotic and the emails are electronically generated. I also have the assumption the only way to get through this electronic screen is to have an internal reference bring by my paper resume to HR. I hope I'm incorrect, and there are skilled HR recruiters spotting unique talent by throughly going through all the resumes that come in. 

Thank you for your time,
"
"It has been months since I applied for this position and this was the first response I have received. I understand that many candidates are applying for positions at such a large corporation. But after not receiving correspondence after a few weeks I forget that I have even applied for a position.
 "
"It has been difficult to find a talent on piece of paper. Actual thought process and attitude that can help for better innovations.
"
"it felt pretty impersonal. Here was the email.

""Sir or Madam:

We have received your application for the position of Senior R&D Engineer-4887170315. After careful consideration, we regret to inform you that you have not been selected for this position.

We will retain your candidate file in our database and may inform you of job openings that match your profile if you selected this option. We also invite you to visit the Career Section on our Web site regularly.

We thank you for your interest in Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies and wish you all the best in your career.

Best Regards,
Johnson & Johnson Talent Acquisition Team""

I do like that I was told that I was not selected. It is nice not to be left hanging."
It feels like there is very little feedback from J&J about the process. 
"It depends on the recruiter and the hiring manager or team. My opinion is that interviews should not be a set of standard questions, but a more personalized form. Every person has a different personality, and standard questionnaires can obscure a talent. "
"It comes across as a complete black box, you apply and then nothing happens so you just assume that you are not a good candidate. "
"It certainly would be good to hear from the recruiter.

Regarding the 1st question, the communication looked like this.
1) A confirmation of receipt of my on-line application.
2) A notice that other candidates had been selected.  If the recruiter is supposed to identify ""why you aren't a fit"" that information was not part of the communication process.
3) I don't remember how long of an interval elapsed between the application being submitted, and the notice I received, but it seems to me it may have been substantial (4-8 weeks)."
"It can take quite a while to hear back. If possible, provide a timeframe for decision process.  "
It can start by being more personal. Sure you get a lot of resumes and many people applying. But your process is slow and very robotic. Not letting people know where they stand in regards to applications is indicative of the type of company you are. I would have thought Johnson & Johnson would be a higher degree of company. More personable and interested in the welfare of the people interested in joining them than what I experienced.
"It can be more personalized process and the feed back was only electronic. I for example have a great deal of experience with CARTO systems and their interface with EP lab monitoring systems ( like Prucka GE, EP med STJ and Bard EP BSCI ) but I was never even given a tryout period.
J&J is a great company but the recruiters need to do little more research to hire the ground people who know the labs and their procedures. 
Thank you for the opportunity to leave a feedback. 
God bless "
It can be improved by making it less automatic. I understand that the company finds easily a pool of talents given the strong brand and good reputation but it will be nice to be contacted sometimes by the recruiter to know the why and maybe helped to know what can match better.
It appears to be satisfactory. You just keep going smoothly.
"It appears they are looking at a specific target audience for candidates. That seems to be young with little experience, but highly educated. I have applied to multiple positions at J & J and never hear back. I understand and accept the philosophy."
It appears the position was filled before my application was viewed (more than one month post submission of application).  This is disappointing as I believe I was an exceptional candidate for the position and did not get the opportunity to interview or to have my application reviewed.  
It appears that when applying on line there's a standard reply saying there are more qualified candidates.  It's hard to know someone talents simply from a resume'.  I find it more effective to speak directly with the hiring manager is the best means of hiring the person that best meets the company's objectives.
It all depends on how they do the review process. Perhaps too automatically done at earliest stages. Thank you
Is there really a process 
"Is the recruitment process for real?
Is there a recruiter involved?"
Is obvious that this job positions when are posted they are already set for a specific person.
is disgusting
Iprove Cycle  times to get Agility  in  the  
Involve scientists in the talent screening process.  You are obviously weeding out well qualified people by not forwarding resumes/CVs to the hiring manager. Qualification judgments are being made by people unqualified to make the assessments.  Keyword searches in a resume aren't working.
Involve me in some way would be a good start. 
"Invite the candidates like me to a meeting so I can explain in person why I feel I can meet  your requirements to become a Johnson & Johnson employee, just filling out a form in the web site is such a week way to evaluate the employee, I'm disappointed with this process."
"Invite qualified candidate for personal interview with panel, and to assess the candidate qualification on the basis of discussion on business scenario based analysis."
Invite me in for an interview!!!
Invite me in for an interview! I would be an asset for your team!
Invite me for an interview :)
Invite for interview
"interviewed too many times, 6 times. hiring manager changed interview times last minute twice"
"Interview status, outcome and next steps during the interview process should be clearly communicated. Also any delay's and expected start date should be communicated in a timely way so that the interviewee is not waiting for more than half a year before hearing back."
Interview qualified candidates for positions.I have established 2 businesses and know sales very well. I was never interviewed once with all of my application submissions. If you are hiring young people that's what you will get-inexperience. 
Interview prospects 
"Interview process started in August.. turned down multiple offers from other reputable companies during the time I was waiting and interviewing with j & j did not hear final answer until 1/17.. 5 month process that was entirely to long.. only feedback included manager is moving forward with other candidates.. Not exactly constructive and/or useful feedback.
"
Interview process should scan candidates on broader perspective.
Interview process is taking lots of time.
Interview more than qualified candidates
Interview more candidates for positions. I have applied for several positions over the last 9 months and I have not been contacted for any interviews. I was 1 of the 150 candidates chosen to attend the BE VITAL event in Tampa in 2016.  
Interview me.
Interview me!
Interview me for the selected jobs.
"Interview incredibly qualified candidates. Review my qualifications again, review your job requirements. Then tell me why I didn't warrant an interview. "
Interview highly qualified candidates or tell them why they are not being interviewed
"Interview candidates. You cannot determine a person's candidacy for your company until you interview them in person. You are sending the message..."" That you do not care."".
"
"Interview candidates that have great credentials. If you do not, you are settling for less than the beat. You should strive to get the best.

If you decide not to interview a candidate, tell them why. What additional credentials are you looking for."
Interview candidates based on experience versus looking at the age of the candidate.  Experience delivers value sooner! 
Interview applicants   Resumes are a shallow list of a persons experience
"Interview and hire people with amazing talent and skills and don't expect a history in pharmaceutical sales only.  I believe you are passing on a lot of incredible candidates that with a litttle company training can become stars for J&J.  That's all, many blessings."
Internal promotion blocking by mana
"Internal application for a function within JnJ.

No feedback at all on the application, no contact with the recruiter, long period of time (4 months) between applying and receiving an answer that I would not be taken into consideration  for the position.

Extremely unhappy with this way of working. 
Reflects poorly on the recruiting process

Items for improvement: provide feedback in a timely manner, provide feedback
"
Interestingly enough to get a rejection as an automated reply is something of a change.  Perhaps reviewing applications that take 15 minutes to complete before spamming out a reject notice would be appreciated. 
Interesting that I was passed over for this job and yet I recently was brought on to the CCI project as a contractor in a similar capacity.  I am still interested in joining JNJ as a full time employee... perhaps my current management can assist me in that endeavor... 
"Interesting that I even received the request for feedback and difficult to answer because I submited for the position and a month or more later I received an e-mail telling me that I was not considered.  Since most of the questions refer to actually being considered for the position and receiving an interview, none of which happened, most of the questions are really mute. That is the extent of my experience with the process.  I don't think it makes an individual even feel they were considered.  No actual contact, no reason offered as to why I was not a match for the postion.  And even more interesting, the hiring manager is my manager and even he provided nothing regarding why I was or was not considered as a viable candidate.  Kind of of sad. "
"Interact with candidates via phone call, only those which apply for senior positions start with senior director or director level, in order to maintain database for future potential roles which might fit the candidate and J&J. "
interact with candidates instead of recruting software GUI 
Interact directly with candidates and stop sending so many surveys.
"Instead of the typical ""Dear John"" letter, let the prospect know why they werre not chosen versus ""we have other candidates more qualified."" A candidate takes his/her time to complete an application and forward documents and that should be respected as should a reason for not interviewing."
"Instead of sending an automated email saying I didn't qualify for the job, a quick 10 minute call could give J&J a better idea of who I am and what I do. 

The email said I other candidates were better qualified. I find that interesting, given that for the past five years I have been a global Marketing and Product manager in a Dow Jones index company and the position was very similar to what I do."
Instead of sending a survey to tell me I wasn't a good fit an email would have been better
Instead of phone interview for screening candidates there should be another way of selecting candidates. So that both of parties get fair chance to present each other.
"Instead of hiring person from references please call up on more candidates for an interview.
"
"Instead of going thru agencies for talent, do direct hiring. I was turned off when I found out that the positions I was being considered for were temporary for 1-2 years and then I would have to take a six month separation to return for possible employment. This was a key factor in my decision to accept employment elsewhere."
Instead of an automated system I would have preferred to speak to a person. I believe you are missing out on seriously talented potential employees because of specific buzz words or salary numbers that the system automatically rejects. 
Instead od automated response please review the resumes properly and then decide.
"Initial communication of interest is quick. 
Followup communication is slow.  Learning the process is over can take months."
Inform why I was not selected. 
"inform us about the process. Send rejection e-mail.....

Although i love the company, the recruitment process is a mess."

"Industry experience is not necessarily a predictive indicator of success in a role, and candidates that possess the necessary skills proven in other industries are likely not given the same credit as a candidate from a competitor, which is a flawed recruitment approach by the HR team and hiring managers.

"Increasing communication about recruitment decisions would be one opportunity for improvement.  I've since started a postdoc at Scripps, but always wondered what happened to my J&J application.  I just searched my email again and was unable to locate a communication regarding J&J's decision."
Increased comunication
Increased communication via emails/calls from recruiters/hiring managers to ensure transparency and updates on recruitment process. 
Increased communication on the reasons why candidates weren't selected. Maybe give a reason or two. 
increased communication
increase transparency of the process
"Increase transparency as to why decisions are made.

"
Increase transparency & feedback; allow candidates to respond to feedback to avoid misunderstanding.
"Increase the transparency tremendously. First of all, I was never called for this position, but obviously someone in the system reported that I was interviewed. 

I think J&J projects a good, positive image, but the hiring process is shameful and impersonal. As a former employee with many personal contacts still within J&J, I think it could be a lot better. Especially since I still have visibility to inside only positions. For my own former position, I deserve a courtesy call from the recruiter or the hiring manager letting me know why they aren't even putting me in the pool of candidates under consideration. 

If nothing else, the system could be set up for responses to be sent to applicants - we are in the initial screening stage, we have reached the interview stage for candidates, your application was flagged by the automated system, etc. Help people understand what is happening. It is so impersonal to get an automated rejection notice, especially from former peers!
"
Increase the response rate for the applications 
"increase the level of feedback to applicants (in my experience it is currently zero)

improve the response time to applications (in my experience it is currently on the order of 3+ months, minimum.  in fact, i suspect that the only reason i got a response at all was so i could be sent this survey)"
"Increase or have no limit on the size of a requested resume.  I have whittled down mine and I know some information, although not directly related or recently completed, I decided to leave out can be a good indicator of a persons interests, abilities, and work ethic.  More candidate information may make finding the best person for your organization a whole lot easier.  Thank You!"
"Increase number of touchpoints and be sure to follow up with the recruits after, even if they are not a good fit"
Increase diversity in hiring employees for global positions even from small countries like Greece!!
"Increase communication, effective communication"
Increase communication time.
Increase communication in the recruitment process .

Incorporate assessments to measure real world ability versus relying on past information which may disfavour potential employees who have a shorter or non-related work history.

"Include closing date for application.
Add position level and if there are direct reports or no.

Include an HR representative in the interviewing process to insure all departments are selecting qualified candidate for the available position. This will prevent and put a stop to the buddy buddy system that is obviously being used.    
Include a face to face meeting or online chat with the hiring manager. Provide feedback on weaknesses in resume or interviews. Provide candidate an opportunity to respond to perceived weaknesses
"In todays hunt for employment, JJ is better than most. As a person looking for work, and believing that I am a great fit, it would be nice to know why my resume did not fit your needs. On a positive note, most employers do NOT even respond, so you never know if your ""in the running"" or in the ""no"" pile - I was impressed that within 1 day, I at least had a response of ""sorry no"" - thank you for no leaving me wondering one way or the other.

"In today's world, it seems like follow up in the business world has fallen away.  Thank you notes, calls have been replaced with emails and texts.  If I were running a large business, I would be sure from top to bottom, the little details would be stressed.  I have been selling for over 25 years, there is nothing like a face to face meeting or a hand written letter (or note) to a client, peer or source.  It is the little things that make the character of an organization."

Poor. 
In the position for HIV specialist in Richmond Va, the manager was an excellent communicator and she is an asset to J&J. Even though I didn't get the position, Julene Williams called me personally and explained delays as well as when she moved the final candidates forward. People like her make me want to come to J&J. As for the above cardiology position, I got ZERO COMMUNICATION. "
"In this particular case, I received the automated email that I was not being considered about 2.5 years after I applied for the role. I obviously knew I wasn't being considered and have since taken on a new role within J&J but it was very odd to receive that email when I did. Probably should have just not sent it at all."
"In this fast-paced environment, there should be ways to apply with less clicks.

Once the application has been submitted it would be nice to hear back a few weeks later if the selection process is still in progress, if the qualifications do not match or if next steps are required."
"In this case, didn't hear from anyone until the position was being filled by someone else."
In these situations a live contact is better than a form email letter.

"In the recruitment process for Johnson & Johnson I receive calls from recruiting companies to apply on my behalf. I normally receive these calls from a few different companies and they all want exclusive rights to my application. I understand it is a business, but they act like vultures by telling me how great a match they believe I am for the position. At one time I was encouraged by these calls but no more.
Because I need (and want) to work, I go along and fill out all their paperwork. The sad part is I have not once received an in-person interview at Johnson & Johnson. The recruitment process is souring me on your company and I have now come to realize my outstanding skills and work ethic will not be able to support your company’s mission and vision. 
I am currently working on a professional doctorate but my resume is limited to a long tenure in one company and a few stops before. It is clear to me, the Johnson & Johnson recruitment process hires for “where someone is running from (last employment), instead of where someone is running to.” 
Have a great day

"In the question above ""Did the recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to?"".  I answered ""no"" because I was offered the job, but unfortunately my salary requirements were not able to be met so I had to turn the job down."
"In the past 2 years, I've interviewed for 2 different positions at J&J, and came close to receiving actual offers before I was informed that the positions got cancelled due to changing business needs. This is a much higher frequency of position cancellation as compared to other companies with which I've interviewed. 

I would like to see that the positions being posted are actively recruiting with a lower risk of being cancelled. "

"In response to the question did the recruiter contact me and provide a reason as to why I was not a good fit for the organization, I can honestly say no. I received an email that said ""the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy"". This is not a true ""reason"". It is clear I'm qualified, probably more than qualified, with a BBA and MBA, along with over 8 years administrative experience. I'm sure Johnson & Johnson gets hundreds of applicants for each job, however as a major brand shouldn't more be done to distinguish this organization away from this sad, faceless, impersonal automated email that applicants receive? Based on this experience, I do not think that I will apply to this company again. "
"In regards to positions in US, the first questions were related to legal VISA status and i had the impression that this is a very key point in the process. it gave the impression that non-VISA holders have very low priority in the selection process despite having related expertise and experience.

So if the VISA requirement is a key requirement, it should noted before the application in US positions to avoid false expectations and save time both side"
"In principle, let me said that I am filling out this survey but still now I did not received a confirmation if I am in the hiring process or not so, I recommend to be sure what about the status of the process then, send the survey to the candidate.
If this information is part of the process please, ignore my comments above and take in consideration only try to be more close with the person."
In my view Recruitment Process will be more helpful if we get a valued feedback from the team though the candidate is selected or not. At least it will help the candidate as a ray of hope if they say a rejection mail or an approval mail. Everything else was great with J&J.

"In my particular situation my first point of contact with someone from J&J was with Skylar Thompson.  I felt she did not have the information needed to explain the position in detail, which was disappointing.  After our phone call she told me I was to attend the in person interviews in New Brunswick, only to find out by e-mail the hiring team chose not to pursue my candidacy.  I called and e-mailed her to find out if this e-mail was a mistake after she told me I was to attend the in person interviews, but I never received any correspondence from her.  Only after a few days did the recruiter from Kforce, Kyung Blackburn, contact me with a vague reason why.  Apparently, Skylar felt that because I did not know the company Credo that I did not do my research thoroughly on the company and that is why I wasn't chosen to move on with the next round of interviews.  All in all a completely disappointing experience on my end, never would I suspect a company like J&J would have that type of recruiting experience. "

In J&J it is about who you know. Only friends and family members are given certain positions. I worked there as a contractor but favoritism is going on in that company.
"In general, it is a good process."
"In case of rejection, the recruiter should mention reasons for that decision"
In all honesty its a black hole. Nothing happens when I apply for a position. J&J needs to seriously rethink their recruitment process and how they communicate with their prospective employees.
"In a dynamically evolving business environment, J&J is backward looking in sourcing and hiring talent, much like most firms. Rather than look forward and hire talent for a position with evolving responsibilities, most companies seek to clone the incumbent who last held this position. In essence, most companies seek the status quo and are not forward looking. Unconventional work experience that meets the necessary qualifications and adds a dimension of diversity of experience is frowned upon in favor for someone who held same exact job in same exact type company and had same exact career progression as last person who held the position."

I had to contact the Talent person to understand that meaning, it was a (cold) termination of the process, and she provided not rationale.

I would love to, and I still pursue, career opportunities at J&J, although with less optimism and altruistic perspective.  That ""great place, great people, super brand"" appears to be another talent acquisition churner.... sad but I understand it is likely a simple one time bad day event.

Improve communications would be helpful.  I also think the company should determine a method to measure intensity of candidates.  Not sure how this can be done but I have always wanted to work for JNJ's HR function and I have tremendous qualifications.  Since I have 25 years experience I understand how candidates can get lost in the system but I expect with JNJ's resources at their disposal it should be setting the standard.  None of this will keep me from applying in the future however.
"Improve communications with candidates during the process. Candidates spend time and effort applying to positions they think are a good fit for them, not taking the time to review applications is wrong. J&J has always been a who you know company when it comes to hiring or taking interns/co-ops from college rather than tapping exceptional talent across various areas.

Im not sure but I never got contacted about interviewing for this position. I got a generic email thanking me for applying. I was a perfect match for the position. Never heard a word. I heard from a friend who works at j&j not to even bother about it because the hiring person had already promised the job for somebody who worked at Merck who worked in the same unit as another director who had been recently hired from Merck. She told me at the time that J&j had posted the position so they could fulfill HR requirements of interviewing others but the position already belonged to somebody. Not transparent. Not fair.
"If your organization is interested in a candidate although a position is not currently available that may be suitable, I would recommend conducting an exploratory interview to begin building a relationship with that candidate.

That manager, personally reached out to me and let me know I represented myself well and would recommend me for future openings  and did just that with the Baltimore West  territory.  This time around I received no call at all, nor an explanation.  

I would think a candidate who was a strong contender similar role, only to lose out to a internal presidents club candidate would still be a strong option.

Better communication of internal referrals and recommendations could go a long way as I would say a ball was dropped."
If the email stated why I was not chosen for an interview with a recruiter.

"if possible to know what was wrong with my application.. perhaps there is some info I am missing .... so if that's the case I will be refuse pretty much in all applications I made since I will be making the same mistake every time...

i.e. I didn't put the cover letter.. but the system allowed me to complete application.... was that a determinant to be discarded  ????... if not.. why system has requirements that you can bypass as user???

thanks"
If possible make the position requirements more transparent so that applicants apply for position more in line with their experience.
"If people do apply, don't leave them hanging. Get back in touch with people either through emails or calls, to let them know whether or not they are moving on with the interview process."
"If one is being considered for a position, it would be nice to know that is the case with a possible timeline for whether or not an interview would be considered. If one is not being considered, a ""thank you for applying, but..."" email would be considerate. "
If nothing else just send a form letter saying thank you but no thank you.  This would take 1 minute to do. Common courtesy.
"If not interested, at least send out a rejection letter."
"If not chosen for the position, just sending an automated email saying the position is filled would definitely help."
"If my resume does not fit your requirements, then recommend other positions that are or at least explain the reason why I was not qualified."
If more detailed reason could be provided for not selecting a candidate or shortlisting a resume it would be much better.
"If managing time and juggling the unexpected is part of the recruitment evaluation then the short (1day) notice for interviews makes sense.  

Otherwise, role modeling respectful planning would be more attractive to potential candidates like myself.

Thank-you for the opportunity."
"If Johnson & Johnson provide opportunity for the students who are from abroad and wanted to join. Again, I might be wrong but i heard from one of the employee that company do not provide opportunity for student on visa. "
"If Johnson & Johnson is serious to get the top talents in the industry, please pick up the phone and share feedback with the candidate. This might take only 5-15 min. 

I spent hours to prepare, investigate and to submit the information application) in the system. 

You spent 1 second to send a standard email for a not fit. 

I have no idea, why and how to improve for the future.

Would you recommend such a company?

When somebody sent me the CV, and the candidate didn't fit, I called them always back. This is personal and respectful. The candidate had at least the chance to ask the reason, what went wrong and / or how to improve for the future. 

Hope this helps.

If this is not a common practice above, I would still consider to work for J&J.
"
"If J&J is really wanting to provide reasons on why or why not someone was selected or passed over, a form letter is not sufficient. "
"if J & J is not interested, they should immediately send a rejection letter.  I am more than qualified for the positions I am applying to and either do not hear any response or three months after applying receive a rejection letter.  A number of recruiters have told me that if I were a minority (Latino, Asian or Black) I would have probably gotten the job !"
if it provides a reason for not selecting a candidate rather than sending an autoreply to all would be appreciated. 
"If I were to be considered for a position at J&J, I would like to receive information about the status of the recruitment process. 

However, If I were not being called in for an interview, I would expect feedback about the reason for declining my job application. Hence, I can improve it for future vacancies at J&J
"
"If I was not contacted by a recruiter how can I recommend someone. 
I like the company and my friend  was working with the company and said good things about the company. That's  why I keep on applying. "
"If I was not a good fit for the position, it would be useful to know what kind of positions at J&J my qualifications do fit.  Even if an opening does not currently exist, it would be helpful to understand where my experience would be valuable to J&J."
If I received an email letting me know I was turned down for the position I can't find it. By providing honest feedback it helps me understand if I'm a good fit for a different job moving forward.
"If I did receive a reply in regards to this position, it was a standard rejection email.  This is appreciated; however, I have been applying to so many positions where I meet the minimum qualifications, that I have personally lost track of which application is which.  I would really prefer in the rejection email why to which I didn't receive an invite to further interview."
"If I could have been considered that would have been helpful.  One never knows who the most likely fit for a company.  I'm sure hundreds of resumes are received.
After months of searching I decided to end my search and retire."
"If for any position, nationals from outside the country of posting are not going to be considered, it should be mentioned in the job posting. I applied for a couple of positions where I fit the requirement completely but was just rejected because I did not have a work visa for that country. If this was a requirement, then the advertisement should have mentioned this explicitly."
"If employers already know who they want for a position, they should just be able to higher them.  Instead of going through the interview process with no intentions of hiring anyone else.  This is discouraging to the interviewee."
"If don't accept a candidate, please let him/her know the result."
"If at least I had been contacted for the position mentioned above, that would have shown some respect for the candidate. On another occasion, I have been phone interviewed by an HR member from J&J (Tampa-FL) who said she would definitely get in touch with me in the next 2 weeks but she never did; she did not even replied to my email message!  "
"If at all possible, have your recruiters send notes for all positions a candidate has applied for. If this process only applies for Senior executive positions, then is a bit useless."
"If applicants are in the talent network it would benefit both J&J and the applicant if the hiring department respondes to a rejected applicant with the following info:
1. You did not meet the criteria for this position in the following areas (so that the applicant can work on weaknesses)
And
2.however, your qualifications are a good/possible match for the following positions. 
* what position type fits someone with 10 yr university teaching and 10 years 
of overlapping sports medicine experience including time in multiple orthopaedic surgeries with athlete/patients while working under team physician/surgeon? 618-581-5593.-Katy"
"If applicant is referred by a current employee and meets position requirements ( in my case I sold current Janssen products in a contract capacity, InVentiv) a phone conversation at minimum would be helpful. Also an understanding of what criteria was not met to applicable position to warrant no communication and or rejection."
"If a resume that has been submitted may not be suited per se for the position applied for, it would be nice if perhaps a reply is sent to the applicant suggesting that he/she apply for some other positions that may be more in line with their qualifications or which are similar to the job actually applied for.  I am sure the feedback would be appreciated by all applicants.  Thank you.  "
If a recruiter is to contact applicants about not being a good fit then I should have received a message.
"If a recruiter is supposed to call, they should call."
"If a recruiter is supposed to be in contact with potential employees, they should reach out at least once."
"if a highly skilled person, such as myself, comes to you for a position, it would behoove J&J to respond via a call to say, ""you seem valuable, lets get to know what you've done and where you want to go....""  "
if a candidate is rejected atleast notify them about the same
"If a candidate is deemed ineligible for a position that they applied, the regular disclaimer is ""your application will be kept on file for future opportunities that may present within our organization.""  How many times has this occurred? 
In recognition of managers timelines and consideration for recruitment costs, this candidate now should be filtered within a searchable network for future consideration. 

"
"If a candidate is brought in for an interview then there should be a follow-up process after the interview.  I reached out to the team, but I did not receive a response.  I used a personal day to interview and I found all the interactions with the team to be very positive.  It would be nice to have constructive feedback otherwise the process seems artificial."
"If a call or an email was sent to explain, they saw my resume but found better qualified peoplle."
"Idk, give me an interview? I already have a job though so don't really care"
"I,m happy with the feed back I get from the recruiting Dept. I would like a chance to prove myself with this company cause I haved for my Past employment .I,m willing to Learn if you are willing to Teach ..Passion is the key to success"
"I've worked in the medical field for 10 years in both clinical and sales capacities.  I applied for various J&J positions that I was absolutely qualified for but not once was I ever contacted for a phone call or interview but rather received a generic ""thank you for your interest but we are going to pursue other candidates"" email. "
"I've stated before in numerous J&J surveys how poor the recruitment process is.
J&J has so many needs for intelligent, capable people. And I'm sure most people you recruit are intelligent and help you move forward. However, I see many extremely capable people who are overlooked.
If you truly want to improve your recruitment for J&J, then ask some good process improvement specialists to analyze your process.
If you want to help the people you reject, give personalized, constructive criticism. I know you don't want to expose yourself to lawsuits...I'm not stupid. But I'm sure many rejected candidates would gladly sign contracts agreeing not to sue you in return for information about the decision so they could have a fighting chance to improve their odds of getting a job."
"I've received three separate, seemingly automated, emails to fill out a survey. I'd rather have 1 longer survey to complete in one sitting, than 3 separate surveys sent to me over the span of weeks."
"I've received ten times more communication asking me to do the survey versus feedback from recruiters.

I have a MBA, am licensed as a RN, and recruiters don't call back when they commit to doing so. I work for a Fortune 10 healthcare company currently and my opinion of J&J has been very negatively impacted by the recruitment experience. I am no longer seeking employment opportunities with J&J because of this experience. "
I've received nothing regarding the position I applied to... online applications are lost in Black Hole
"I've received many surveys asking me to rate the ease of the application process, which is great, but it would be nice to hear back from someone whether I was being moved forward in the application process."
"I've read many reviews on the interview process for J&J. At least 90% of the reviews/articles I've read mention the same feedback, ""Unless you know someone that works there don't even bother applying."" I know it's a Corporate America fact that networking is key but you'd think that after trying to connect with 3+ J&J recruiters via. LinkedIn that at least one of them would like to have an exploratory conversation with you. Regardless, I still have so much respect for this company and hope to one day contribute my skill set to this organization!"
"I've not received any feedback about the Head, Global Learning, Performance and Development position so this request for feedback seems odd. I assume now, given the first question, that I'm not longer being considered as a candidate. It would have been more appropriate to communicate this information separately and before receiving this request. "
"I've never spoken to a recruiter.  I've applied for positions, and not heard anything from anyone.  I get these survey requests, but I've not been contacted by a recruiter or anyone else.  
I don't get an email or call telling me that I'm not a fit for the position or anything.  If I actually spoke to someone my score would probably change.  All this has done for me is made me stop putting in on positions at Johnson & Johnson which I know to be a good company.  "
"I've never received feedback despite applying for a few positions.  I have friends that are VPs @ J&J - and while I could get a referral - I thought I would test out the recruitment/staffing process.  It has to this point failed.

I'm really surprised.  MBA with an IT designation, a degree in Pharmacology and Toxicology, Global Supply chain experience, Big Data experience - I thought that would warrant at least a follow up phone call.

Is the software filtering out suitable candidates?"
I've never received a rejection email from your team. 
"I've never had any contact with an actual recruiter. I've just applied online and eventually the online system sends me an automated rejection for roles.  No contact with people so far. I assume if a candidate is selected for an interview, and then is rejected, it would be good to receive feedback from a recruiter."
I've never been to so many interviews for a job opening before.  I truly deem J&J as an excellent company to work for but the number of interviews can be streamlined a bit.  Thank you.
"I've lived in Princeton the last 15 years.  I've been practicing law for over 20 years.  I've built an impeccable reputation among my colleagues as well as in my community.  I serve on the Board for the American Diabetes Association. In my opinion, when a candidate with my credentials does not even get invited in for an interview for a position he's qualified to hold, then there must be something wrong with the recruitment process.  I hope my filling out this survey is not misinterpreted.  I respect J&J a great deal.  It's the reason I applied for the position.  I just wonder how many strong candidates fall through the cracks of the hiring process like I did."
"I've heard that you only hire/interview from individuals who have knowledge of the J&J processes.  The reason why I went through recruiters for temp/to hire.  

I would love to be a part of J&J, but it seems very difficult to get in.  J&J, I assume, is in high demand as an employer.

"
"I've had no contact from J&J HR, despite direct experience supporting J&J operations as a contractor.  

ANY contact, to include 'just stop applying' would be more useful than the silence."
"I've had a very bad experience.  The overall process took very long (from Feb until Jan - almost a year!).  There were no updates on what was happening with applications until 6 months after the initial submission.  By then, I already have a different job.  The overall interviews went very well and I received feedback that was extremely positive.  Next step was going to be a recruiter from HR was going to have a call with me but then he just disappeared and I've never heard back from him.  I contacted the direct manager and the recruiter multiple times and did not hear back at all.  I understand if the interviews did not go well and you no longer wanted to continue but providing extremely positive feedback from multiple interviewers and then just completely ignoring my correspondence is just plain rude.  Extremely unprofessional and, frankly, unexpected from an amazing company like J&J.  I really wanted to work for the company, however after this experience my opinion of J&J has changed dramatically for the worse.  Very unfortunate."
"I've filled this survey several times, but I never got a feedback from the recruiter. "
"I've been in pharmaceuticals for over 13 years and was referred to the position. It would have been nice to be even considered or called. I was told by another rep that someone was prechosen ahead of time, so I never stood a chance. Had I known that someone was prechosen, I would not have applied. "
"I've been contacted almost a dozen times to fill out this survey. I found the subject line ""We'd like to hear from you"" ironic as I never heard anything back in any form after completing my application. I'm only filling this out to stop the spam emails. "
"I've applied to work for Johnson & Johnson more than 5/6 times, I won't give up because I believe it's a reputable company that I'd be proud to work with/ for given the chance. I just wish the recruiter(S) will give me a reason for not giving me that Orpotunity. I still Beleive that I have something to offer with experience drawn from my diverse medical training and life experiences from Africa to Canada. I thank you for the previledge to let my voice be heard through this survey."
"I've applied to several positions that I'm sure I'm qualified for, but I've yet to receive a call. "
I've applied to many jobs with the no feedback; only these requests to review Johnson & Johnson's hiring process. 
"I've applied to many jobs with Johnson and Johnson (it is my dream company to with for) and I haven't had any luck. I am an educated, humble, driven worker. It would be nice to get a call back from someone to explain anything. "
"I've applied to 3 positions at J&J and have never been contacted by the recruiter, but have been asked to complete this survey each time.  It has not left a favorable impression on me. "
I've applied multiple times and have plenty of experience. I had no clue you even had my resume. It was months since I applied. 
I've applied for several positions but have not yet been selected for an interview.  I currently work in a Shared Services environment and would love to use my knowledge to make a difference at Johnson & Johnson's Shared Services center in Tampa
I've applied for several jobs and the only feedback I get is a computer generated email stating I am not a candidate. Very disappointing. Can't even find out who the hiring manager is in most cases so you don't even have the opportunity to talk to them. After 25 years at J&J I feel very much like a number.
"I've applied fo multiple
Jobs and have not received any feedback other than this email to take the survey. "
"I've always thought highly of Johnson & Johnson and was hoping to get my foot in the door at some point. Unfortunately, the recruiting process for J&J is similar to standard industry practice, where there is little to no personal touch. Please do not take offense, I imagine that there are too many resumes received to reach out to every applicant personally. I just find it disappointing as there is no way to  get your foot in the door unless you know someone. I applied two times and within a very short time I received an email stating ""the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position."" I have over 20 years experience in managing administration, operations and customer service teams. I excel at providing and managing teams that provide service excellence. I have over 10 years HR experience and have continued to stay up to date in the industry. I will remain hopeful and will keep a watchful eye out for future openings in hopes that one day, I will be considered. 
Thank you for seeking feedback. 
Best Wishes

I'm unsure how since I have not been contacted by Johnson & Johnson about the recruitment process or the job I applied too.
I'm tired of being rejected. Refer me to positions that are more aligned with my background and experience.
"I'm surprised I received no consideration. 20 years in 3D Printing, I inventrd and patented 3D Printing ecommerce and have founded 3 companies on the topic. I've fliwn worldwide to speak on the topic too including being hired by Dupont to consult."
"I'm sure Johnson & Johnson receives thousands of resumes daily. I had no interaction with anyone from Recruiting, not even an automatic acknowledgement of my resume, until I received this survey. For that reason alone, I chose to spend my precious free time to respond. As an HR Professional, I know that it take just a few short key strokes to send a courteous ""thanks/but no thanks email"" and I didn't receive one of those. I expected more from Johnson & Johnson."
"I'm still unaware of my status, but by this email. I would assume I didn't qualify even though my qualifications are far beyond the requirements.
Thanks,
Walter"
"I'm quite unsure why I was not granted an interview for this position.  I have interviewed three separate times for similar positions using the same resume and application.  I know I meet all of the qualifications for the position, but I could not get an interview this time.  Im confused."
"I'm often told that positions of interest are already slated or even opened for folks already in the group. This is especially true of Janssen positions. However, they are required to be opened for bidding which creates frustration. I know this is a fact because MY position was specifically opened for me in 2014 and it was opened to bid. Folks applied and were given courtesy interviews. It's not a very practical or considerate practice. As far as recruiters go, I've never heard why I wasn't selected or even been given a status update until the death notice comes in the email. And for some positions, that email never came. "
I'm not sure why you are asking me to take the survey.  I was never contacted about the position that I applied for.  Nor did I get an email indicated that I was not being considered for the position.  The only contact I received was the initial email indicating that you received my application and 5 requests to take a survey on my experience.
"I'm not sure why I'm receiving this survey. I was never called for an interview, phone screen or otherwise. ???"
I'm not sure why I'm receiving this survey. I have applied to several positions but have never spoken or communicated with a recruiter.
I'm not sure why I was sent this survey as I was not contacted by a recruiter during this application process which entailed my submission and notification that I was not being considered for the position.
"I'm not sure what your current process should look like.  I did receive an email indicating I was not selected, and that my resume would be kept on file.  Does that constitute being asked to join the talent community?   
Given this, I'm challenged to know what the process should be.   "
"I'm not sure this questionnaire is appropriate. I was offered and accepted the position, however, one question on this survey is ""Did the recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to?""  The question is irrelevant, as I was offered the job."
"I'm not sure it's just a Johnson & Johnson issue. The resume process as a whole in all industry has many flaws. A piece of paper with some details doesn't really give any prospective company the right information to get the best client. Depending on the job function, the best candidate is someone who probably doesn't write a resume that touts all their credentials. Many times it's the person who is less about themselves but has the mindset to see the holistic picture. In the end you have a prospective candidate that will increase your profits and brand your company.

Having said that, I have found from a job seeker, you are better to have relevant questions for any applicant to answer. Assign a value and based on responses to questions and maybe keywords in a resume to pick a prospective candidate. Keywords are subjective, as I have seen recruiters not rating similar functions into the right groups example business intelligence, market intelligence, data analytics, customer insight, customer relationship management are related and interwoven but some recruiters miss that."
I'm not sure if your external recruiting process is just an exercise to check the box or if you all already have an internal candidate in mind and its just a forgone conclusion.
I'm not sure if J&J is really looking for talent outside of the pharma industry. Or perhaps I'm just not the professional profile that works within the pharma industry. I am somewhat reluctant to apply for future positons.
I'm not sure if I am the best to ask these questions of. I received an automated email that I was not selected to move on in the process and that was it. I never had any interaction with a recruiter.
i'm never contacted for the positions that I have applied for wit J&J and I was very qualified and experienced for the positions i submitted my resumes for.
"I'm looking for my resume match to the right job opening.Because I have experience in Inventory,sales,procurement,retail experience,merchandising,etc "
I'm internal candidate and a J&J employee since I started 17years ago as a coop. It was very Pity that the recrutir never contacted me to communicate why I was not even called for an HR interview.
"I'm glad that this opportunity is given to me for feedback. Johnson & Johnson struggles with the same challenges faced by a majority of employers. Improvement suggestions: Respond to the applicant 
(a) with a date by which a decision will be shared
(b) share a link that reflects the status of application
(c) share the reason of rejection to the candidate. This is immensely helpful and gives a guidance to the applicant for improvement. It is for the same reason I am sharing this feedback with you. Show the same courtesy in return. "
I'm getting a survey asking me about my recruitment process for a position for which I applied three months ago and was never contacted.  So that lack of experience or contact with recruiter definitely influenced my scores.
"I'm currently in the hiring pool. I'm very excited at the opportunity to work for Johnson & Johnson. I bring a diverse background with me from Advanced Supervisor Excellence Training, EHS, Star point, Human Performance, Oracle, TPM, Kaizen, SMED. I honestly feel I would be a asset in multiple positions within your Team. I look forward to hearing from you.
Thank you
Michael George"
I'm certain there are many applicants.
"I'm being asked to fill out a survey for a position I applied to, but never received any feedback. The questions refer to a recruiter and the interview process. I was never contacted or sent any update about this position other than multiple emails asking me to fill out a survey. These surveys should be sent to applicants where the questions are relevant."
"I'm an employee and I have noticed that sometimes you get a call from HR, sometimes you dont; but all the same, at the end of the day, as a candidate I want to be informed as to where I am in the interview process. And not left in the dark. There might be other opportunities that might weigh in to my decision of what new opportunity to accept since I'm interviewing for more than one job."
"I'm a previous employee of JNJ, and really expected better communication through this recruitment process"
"I'm a Johnson & Johnson employee, I did not use a recruiter to interview for this position.  I simply searched and posted on the career opportunities website."
I'm a former VP of Sales for 3 different organizations; I've run national accounts and been very successful.  You have a outstanding candidate right here - yet you choose not to pursue or follow up.  I'm scratching my head.......
I'm a diversity candidate who is being disgriminated against be even interviewed by your company; I have contacted my minority rep to this issue
"I'm a contractor currently working at Janssen pharmaceuticals.  I believe it would be useful if contractors could bid using the internal system like employees.  I would think it would be more beneficial to both parties to hire someone within the company whether you are a current employee or contractor, you are both learning and utilizing the same internal systems and procedures and would be more valuable then someone who has never worked for Johnson & Johnson at all. Also, all the positions I have applied for in the last couple of years, I have gotten no feedback to let me know why I'm not even being considered for the opportunities when I know I am more than qualified. "
"I'm a bit confused.  I send in a resume and months later get a ""reject"" communication via email.  I'm not sure you could call that an ""experience"".  I think you may want to reconsider who you send these surveys to."
"I'm a bit confused by getting this survey as I did not interview with anyone at the company.  My resume was submitted but I received a standard ""thank you no thank you"" response via email.  I did not speak with anyone."
"I'm 53 and Caucasian...I'm the problem...not you.

Thanks,

"I'd suggest conducting a phone interview would be a good first step.  I realize you can't do this for every applicant.  Since your jobs seem to be posted for a long period of time, maybe you are over looking people already in your ATS/database.  Try changing your parameters for searching and see what happens.  I'm sure the right candidate is in there someplace.  

HR is a function with transferable skills.  I know, you probably feel that pharma is very different, but it's not.  Most HR folks are adaptable.  I've adapted to multiple industries and was able to leverage my learnings.  Able to look at things from a different perspective, shake things up.  Be visionary.  

If you got a call from Facebook or Amazon, do you think your skills would transfer?  Or are you stuck in pharma for the rest of your career?  

If you don't call, you'll never know what you are missing.  

Have a great day,  Don 

PS: Peter Fasolo was my TA back at FDU, please tell him I said 'hi'.  
PPS: I hope this feedback helps.

"I'd recommend checking to see if there was any contact with candidates before sending out these surveys. I've had a call or followup on exactly one position in two years, but I've received at least a dozen of these surveys. I would love to work for J&J and I've seen many opportunities that have been very close matches for my resume and experience, but a call on only one position. These surveys are actually reducing my opinion of J&J with each new one that I receive. It just serves as a reminder that I've been rejected, but provides no feedback regarding why.

With that one position that I did receive a callback for, I had a very good interview and the manager was very complimentary. He volunteered that I was definitely going to be in the next round of interviews and that he'd also like to float my resume to one of his peers in another group. About a week later I received a follow-up that they'd gone with another candidate and that was it. Nobody would respond to email or phone messages so that I could follow-up on the other possible positions or to find out if there was any way to better position myself for consideration by J&J. It was like I ceased to exist. 

I do understand that rejected candidates aren't always a good investment of time, but I would like to understand what I'm missing or what skills I can develop to improve my chances at future opportunities. "
I'd rather have gotten no response than a response stating not suitable given I have all of the qualifications listed for role applied for.  The speed of the response also left me wondering if anyone really reviewed by qualifications seriously.
I'd love to have feedback on why I was not considered to be a good fit for the position.
I'd like to move forward in the process a little further to form a better opinion. 
I'd like to hear back from someone...
"I'd like to be informed of the STATUS for my job application.  

But, all what I have received, just asking me to fill out the survey form."
"I'd at least like the opportunity of a phone interview for sales, I have over 15 years experience in sales and customer service "
"I wouldn't normally fill this out, but I found the questions odd considering I was never contacted about my posting let alone interviewed!  I am a former J&J employee as I started my career at McNeil, and have many great friends and colleagues still there on the pharma side.  I found this posting interesting, aligned with my background in marketing leadership and a fantastic geographic fit.  I was actually hoping to learn more at the time, but never heard anything and quickly moved on another opportunity.  My only feedback would be more diligence for screening.  Quick phone screens for talent/experience have always been valuable for me as I build teams even if skills are not a perfect match on a listing.  Helps identify talent for current and future roles."
"I would've appreciated an email or something letting my know I was no longer being considered. This survey was sent months, maybe even a year after I applied and has been the only communication since. I find this to be very insincere and unprofessional. "
"I would work to keep good talent informed of where they are in the recruiting process.  It took almost three months for anyone to give me an update. At that point, I had found another position and lost interest in the position I applied for at J&J. Thanks for the opportunity."
"I would very much value an opportunity to speak to someone in HR about open positions BUT to date, while being a strong candidate for roles I have applied for, I have yet to ever been contacted directly. (Either the job posting has been cancelled or an auto reply about the job being filled)  Would love to be able to work at J&J but finding it difficult to get traction with the application process."
I would very much like my resume and information made available to all recruiters within the company and to be contacted if a recruiter sees me as a match for an open job in my region and based on my preferences.  
"I would suggest you should check if the goals you set up for your recruitment process can really be met with your implemented processes.

From my recent experience I really cannot say that I can recommend the recruitment process you have. The questions you pose are very many and from their contents the reasons for them are partly not really understandable - at least for european standards. Furthermore the feedback to the applicant is...well, zero.  Instead I am here again giving you input although no one ever gave me any input or feedback.

So I kindly suggest that you check your processes if you see any options for improvement concerning the suggestions I gave you before.

Yours sincerely,
Stephan"
"I would suggest to allow the candidates interested in the position to directly apply through LinkedIn: the process would be highly simplified, avoiding long redundant questions and  information.

Thanks."
"I would suggest that if the Hiring Mgr. wants to promote someone from within J & J that they let all of the candidates know prior to the panel interviews.  Just telling the candidates that the field of candidates is a competitive one, erroneously characterizes the genuineness of the interview process."
"I would suggest Johnson & Johnson take a more personal approach; and reach out to candidates that meet over 90% of the job postings criteria to say why they were or were not chosen to proceed through the hiring process.

Any type of feedback from HR to strong candidates will help build a better J&J company."
"I would suggest informing the candidate right away if they are being considered or not.  The ""not"" knowing is very stressful when looking for employment.  I believe I would be an asset to your company, so please keep me notified if any position arise that I qualify.

Thank you."
I would suggest including the interviewee in the recruitment process. I was not aware of any steps made in this recruitment process. 
"I would suggest all of you go to your Credo one more time and read my comments below.
The Credo lists everyone as stakeholders, including employees, community and stockholders. I as an applicant am not listed in the Credo and I see this is why you do not treat me and other candidates in a humane way with minimum respect, dignity and compassion.
Do not get me wrong that you are not the only company who do not treat applicants humanely - many other do the same way. But still, when I learned about your corporate culture with Credo at the center, I feel uncomfortable about your treatment of myself."
I would say the best way to improve the recruitment process to follow up with reasoning for not being qualified. I am working on improving my skill set and experience to eventually re apply so a follow up on ways to improve my overall resume would be great.
"I would say that providing ontime information after your initial interview with Recruitment (if you were selected for the second round or not). Other than that, the process is good."
I would say that hiring me would be a great step for me. Thank you.
I would say be more in touch with the candidate by means of communication via recruiter personally but not with an automated email. 
"I would request not to see all applicant through the same lens.I understand that there will be thousands of applicants when a position opens in an entity like yours.
Many have advised me to edit and input fake details as per the job requirements, which I decline to do and maybe due to the same reason I didn't get a chance to be interviewed.
I suggest that you please look at candidates individually and on lonfg term basis.Please look at each one of them.We are putting a lot of effort in applying for a position  and more so, a lot hope rides on each application, not only of the applicants, but of 10 other people who are around him-his/her spouse,children,parents and other immediate dependents.All of them are keen to discover an optimistic news of the applicant finding a good job.HR should provide a fair chance in considering a candidate through a fool proof method.Please don't kick away an applicant for not having matching keywords or lack of just FMCG experience."
"I would recommend trying to at least phone screen every candidate if possible. I believe this because an individual can be very different from what the metrics on his or her resume might say. It would have to be a targeted process from the sheer numbers of applicants a firm like Johnson and Johnson receives. However, a phone screen even after a candidate was not selected for a position might be helpful in identifying those who might fit another position within the organization that already have an interest in working for Johnson and Johnson. "
I would recommend that JNJ should give an opportunity to people who are on student visa/OPT/EAD.
"I would recommend not sending a survey if there was no recruiter involved. I am a previous employee of J&J, left on great terms, and was not contacted live by anyone for this particular opportunity (keeping in mind that I was a hiring manager, and can remember the plethora of applications we received). Otherwise, the application process was fine - just no follow-up by a human."
"I would recommend J&J to family and friends because I know it is a fantastic company.  However, I have not been impressed with the recruitment process.  I have applied to a fair number of financial jobs over the last 5 years and have not been contacted once.  I have only received system generated emails.  I believe if anyone had truly looked at my extensive financial background, they would have at least wanted to have a phone conversation about how I might fit into the J&J financial organization."
"I would recommend having ""out of the box"" criteria when hiring.Think about changing the threshold and have more verbal conversations to really qualify or disqualify a candidate."
"I would recommend following up with candidates or notifying them within several weeks if they are not selected.  If a notice is sent 4-6 months later, it appears as though the organization is indecisiveness and the department lacks clear direction."
I would recommend being a bit more informative regarding the process and it's status.
"I would really love to be part of the J&J Team, however, I feel like you have to know someone inside J&J to even be considered for a position.  I have applied multiple times and I do not hear back for any of the positions I've applied for.  I have a strong skill set/resume, and never even get a phone screen.  This is very disappointing, as I feel I have a lot to offer the company.  I will keep trying!  Thank you for the opportunity to leave feedback."
"I would really like to join the Johnson & Johnson family but due rigid hiring processes it is impossible to get an interview. I would like to speak with some in the HR department to discuss my concerns, considering the company did contact me for my opinion.

"I would prefer to know what steps I could do in order to show the requirements you need rather than a generic reason. The feasability of this sort of recruitment process is dependent on the structure of your organization, but in an ideal world 😉"

Considering my background and years of services, I apply for positions that I feel I am 95-99% match, however, I am not receiving any call even from the recruiter. In one instants, i had a phone interview with the hiring manager.

I would like to know why I wasn't selected.  I would also like direction based on resume and details provided which position I would be a better fit for.

JNJ will post positions available in San Angelo, TX but I understand that I have to reach out to Kelly Sevices for those positions. I can't even get Kelly Service, Abilene, TX, to pick up the phone.

After rereading the recruitment ad, I continue to believe I could benefit the company and find myself wondering why I wasn't pursued.

I have 23 years of call center experience, including Sr. Leadership with major call centers. I know that you receive so many resumes and this may not be possible but from a job seekers stand point, it could be a great help for my next opportunity. "
I would have liked more frequent communication between the time I applied to the position to the time I found out it was closed.  Any sort of update like - still interviewing -sorting though budget.  I think being open and honest about where you are or issues you are encountering would be pleasantly surprising to candidates and make them more likely to check back for other opportunities.
I would have liked hearing from the recruiter concerning my qualifications related to the position. It would also be great to be notified of additional opportunities in the future.

I would have expected to receive an email for acknowledgement or regret.
"I would have benefited from hearing why I was not qualified for this position;  that way I could work on improving/further my education if needed.

I would have appreciated to be informed the reason why i was not a good fit for the position instead of just sending a standard email telling hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position. 
I would have appreciated speaking with an American about the selection process.
I would have appreciated follow-up directly from a recruiter via phone or atleast via a personalized email but I don understand the large number of candidates that apply; so I do understand the lack of personalized response. I greatly appreciate your follow-up.
"I would have appreciated feedback from the recruiter, and I would have also appreciated if the recruiter had pointed me to additional resources or opportunities to work at Johnson & Johnson."
"I would have appreciated a note explaining why I was not selected as I believe my resume was strongly suited for the position. However, I would still work for J and J. "
I would gladly provide feedback but I have only made it through the initial resume submittal process. I have applied to at least 3 different positions and only ever received an email stating that J&J has decided to pursue other candidates.  
"I would encourage recruiters to at least respond PERSONALLY to the applicants who apply for advertised positions and then wait forever to hear the result. It is important to acknowledge their efforts, or else the company might lose a valuable candidate for the job. I would also encourage recruiters to explain in few words to candidates on why their application was rejected and what could they do to improve their candidature for future recruitment. This will tremendously benefits J&J's image. "
"I would encourage more face to face instead of metrics to locate good talent.  I believe more face to face communication would reveal those candidates that are ""diamonds in the rough"""

I would appreciate the opportunity to speak with someone live to explain my fit for the position. 
I would appreciate the feedback on why I wasn't selected.  That information can help me determine the areas that I need to improve in order to work for your organization.
I would appreciate knowing how my experience and education for all the positions I have applied for is not sufficient to even get a phone call. I really want to work for Johnson & Johnson and have a lot to offer.
I would appreciate it if someone in talent acquisition gave me a call and asked me personally about getting a job here at Johnson & Johnson. It seems as thought it has been a waste of my time applying for jobs just to get rejected in the long run. I have a Research & Development background. I am supprised that there is no place for me within this company.
"I would appreciate it if a recruiter would at least pick up the phone and have a conversation with me about possible opportunities at Johnson and Johnson.  I am very interested in working for the company, have a Princeton degree, and have a great deal of executive leadership, sales, revenue growth, project management and service experience.  I have to believe that there is a position to fit my transferable skills."
I would appreciate if you hire me 
I would appreciate if they can give us the reason or what criteria's candidate did not meet.
"I would appreciate if once I submit my resume they consider me and reach out for all open positions that match my skillset.
Also would be great if I can get a response back advising why I am not being considered for a particular position ( also after an interview). "
I would appreciate if I actually got a response of any kind from Johnson & Johnson in regards to the submitted applications and hiring process.
"I would actually appreciate a phone call, please let me know why I am not being considered, and I am not trying to sue the company, please let me know what I can do to better prepare for the role.  Please Please, be honest!!!"
"I worked for McNeil as a senior package engineer (contract position). I have 5 US patents in child resistant / senior friendly packaging, I have customer awards and my designs have been featured in Food and Drug Packaging magazine.

"I worked for J&J previously, before downsizing occurred. After applying for at least 20 or more positions and getting limited or no response, I feel that I'm no longer welcome to the J&J family or that my skills are viewed as irrelevant, though I continue to see a number of individuals with less experience than I have join J&J or get promoted within J&J. It would help if recruiters would provide more insight about why an applicant is no longer being considered for a position. And, it would be helpful to know when an applicant is no longer considered for a position after having an interview with the hiring manager. I had a telephone interview with a hiring manager almost a year ago, then never heard anything else about another candidate being selected. Does that mean the job is still open? I realize J&J receives 8k or more applications per week. However, I think J&J can be better at setting the bar for how the recruitment process can work. Hire me... and let me help you!"
"I worked for Ethicon and was a top sales professional awarded the prestigious Glamour Trip to Spain along with being inducted into the 150K, 250K, and 500K sales clubs.  However I am never contacted for any of the J&J positions I have applied for.  I know that diversity has always been a top priority for J&J but am wondering if my age may have something to do with never receiving a call or interview.  I have a vast amount of sales expertise and would be a valuable contributor to any sales organization.  I would love to once again be a part of the J&J family and would appreciate serious consideration for a position.

"I wonder if my military role excludes me from some positions. Let's face it, you have had people deploy for military duty. I can only assume that many of the roles I applied for may not be conductive to military reservist service, regardless of who benefits. There is no way of knowing the reason that candidacy was rejected.

If Johnson & Johnson is finding the resources it needs in a timely manner, than I have no recommendations. However, if J & J is having problems with finding candidates, then they have to understand how their requirements are limiting candidates that could prove to be highly valuable to the organization."
I wonder if it takes into consideration candidates in Africa? 
I withdrew my candidacy on this position 
"i wished to join Johnson and Johnson, but even though i have work experience of  18 years i was not selected after viewing my resume. that is disappointing but i feel when candidate is having so many years working experience , company should always consider that as a plus point, and little training as per company  work environment any experienced and passionate candidate can adjust them self to work in company life johnson and johnson. 
 "
"I wished to be informed of the end date of applications' final process, so that I won't be waiting for the result anymore."
"I wish you all would look outside the box when hiring...I feel you all could miss on lots of strong candidates, just because of a lack of medical sales background.

No one has experience in medical sales unless given the opportunity to shine to begin with."
I wish they would give me feedback on why I was not chosen for the position and what I could have done.
I wish there was a pre-assessment that can be used to gauged candidate fit actual before the other recruitment activities.  
"I wish that the communication through the application process is better.  I have been with one of the major financial industry for last 21 years in Information Technology area, and sent an application for one of the jobs.  I do understand that there are thousands of applications might be hitting the server, and it is impossible to reply to each and everyone of the applicants.  

Thank you for the opportunity to provide the feedback.

I wish that a recruiter would contact me directly over the phone to discuss instead of no contact or a generic email that the recruiter sends out to everyone.
"I wish someone had reached out to me, for a phone interview at minimum.  I am a strong candidate with an MBA, with over 10 years in pharma sales and I have an extraordinary track record for achievement across many industries and roles.  Which includes having lead the North American Merck Women's Network, which entailed director leadership over 40 leaders and indirectly impacting over 1,500 members. I have not sold in hospital sales; however, I know I would excel and exceed expectations as I have done in every facet of my professional and personal career.  Feel free to reach out to other J&J employees I've worked closely with: Denise Sena (Former Merck colleague) and Yury Gomez (MBA Classmate). Best wishes, with finding the right candidate. "
"I wish recruiters would make human contact with applicants. 
So many good people are lost in the digital world of recruitment.

"
"I wish recruiter provided a reason for rejecting my resume.
I wish I could see recruiters directly. I have a pharmaceutical master degree and few years of work experience; Johnson & Johnson is a pharmaceutical company why I have not been successful to get into it? The branch that I applied for ( Orange County, Irvine ) is 5 minutes away from my place.
I wish I had a chance to get into the company. I am sure the company will treat me as its asset.
"
"I wish Johnson and Johnson would have provided me with feedback through the process. I received no concrete information throughout the process, including absolutely no closure to the process. Perhaps I am still being considered (since January 2017)?

Any actual feedback that can be provided would be greatly appreciated. I want to work for J&J but I do not know why I am not being considered a good fit. "
I wish I had the opportunity to make my case in person. I was 100% confident that I was a great fit. I still love JNJ. Best of luck.
I wish I had the opportunity to at least speak with someone about the position 
I wish I could get more feed back regarding why I was rejected.
"I wish I can say timely notification but at this point, 'any' notification would be great."
I will provide more information for former co-ops to join the organization
I will not work for this company- Totally Useless HR and employees
I went through interviews with 6 JnJ managers for another position. They were super nice and gave positive feedback. At the end I was told that an internal candidate filled in the position. A bit sad. Hope that in the future a new position will be opened to external candidates. I wish to have a second chance.
"I went through 2 months of phone calls that were all positive until I had to call about the next steps, which I was surprised to hear, I had been rejected. Since then every job I apply for, I get rejected. Not very flattering for someone with my expertise."
"I wasn't selected to move forward with any phase of the interview process.  That is perfectly fine, but I would have appreciated some feedback as to what I was missing or what I could do to improve my chances for similar positions in the future. "
I wasn't recruited nor on an interview in the last 5 months and unsure why I am being sent this survey.
"I wasn't even notified that I was not considered for the position. I know J&J is a great company, I will continue to apply for positions."
"I wasn't contacted, but I understand and hope there will he another opportunity in the future.

I wasn't contacted by J&J at all prior to being asked to fill out this survey. Any contact whatsoever would be an improvement over the current recruitment process and updates on the process would be appreciated. 
I wasn't contacted by a recruiter. 
"I wasn't contacted by a recruiter, just an automated email stating that the position had been filled by another candidate. I know how good of an employer J&J is because my uncle works for the company and encourages me to continually apply, I just wish that the application process wasn't so removed. Having an actual recruiter contact me and explain why I wasn't accepted (as stated above in the survey) would absolutely be beneficial -  if it had happened."
"I wasn't contacted by a recruiter as indicated in the question above. Having been a Strategic Partner with J&J through Kelly Services many years ago, as an Onsite Branch Manager, I have a high regard for the J&J company. 

It simply would have been nice to understand why as a well qualified applicant, I wasn't selected as a good fit for the organization. 

Thank you for the survey feedback process.

Sincerely,

I wasn't contacted at all by any recruiter. I just got a rejection email don't why why and if the position was filled or not . 
"I wasn't contacted at all about this opportunity after I applied for it, except for this survey."
"I wasn't called for an interview, just got an email saying I was not considered"
I wasn't called by a recruiter about this position.
I wasn't aware that if I didn't have the exact amount of require experience I would be immediately rejected. I wish that I knew that before getting my hopes up about the positions I applied to.
I wasn't aware that I wasn't the right fit and I am not sure as to why not. I am becoming more and more disillusioned by the J&J employment process. There is almost no contact  and the follow-up is none existent - even those remote times when a recruiter reaches out AND promises follow-up (even in the event of bad news). You can do (and have done) better.
I wasn't aware I was removed from consideration from positions. I will double check my profile settings to ensure I am getting notifications. 
I wasn't  offered a phone interview or an feedback just an email letting me know you received my resume.  And now this survey.  
"I was with Pfizer for 15 years as a Director. Due to the merger of the year the entire division was downsized... 
I applied twice for similar roles at J&J and never got any feedback..."
"I was very very dissapointed; had to call after more than three weeks of the interview. The person in charge indicated that the process was detained due to the Plant's Logístics, and she seemed quite annoyed by my call.
After two months, I received a candidate rejection e-mail. Ironically, today (Friday, April 7th), the same position has been posted for the same Plant, and I was invited to request another J&J interview through my e-mail at your internet site.
I held the position of Financial Marketing Comptroller / Cost Accounting Manager in the 80' - 90's, and at the time the Interview Process we had was never as cumbersome as now.
It is humiliating and a slap on the face!"
"I was very qualified for the Position and surprised my resume did not at least include an exploration phone call, if there were additional questions about my experience. I question why my resume was completely rejected at first glance? Mainly considering my extensive experience in this field. "
I was very disappointed not to hear back on the outcome of the interview. I assumed that I didn't get the job after not hear back. It's been over two months. I had worked with J&J closely and I think highly of it but the team that was handling this process clearly didn't respect the process or the individuals. 
"I was very disappointed in the process.  I was referred by an existing J & J employee, I applied online and was really looking forward to speaking with the recruiter and hiring manager.  However, I never received any contact from your talent recruiter.  
I did however receive an automatic ""not interested in you"" email approximately 1.5 month after I applied for the position."
"I was very disappointed by the process at J&J.  For decades, before their retirement, my parents were legal counsel for J&J, which made me believe it was one of the great companies in CPG.  The recruitment process unfortunately has left me with an unfavorable opinion.  

Having never been contacted by anyone, only to receive a form letter 6 weeks later, stating that my candidacy wasn't being pursued.  Shortly thereafter I saw the position posted again.    For someone who meets every requirement listed on the job posting, it was an eye opening experience.   

Thank you.

"
"I was verbally offered this position by the reporting manager, after multiple phone and onsite interviews as well as a presentation component, only to find out that the position was not yet fully approved to fill by corporate. I spent MONTHS in the interview process to be offered a job that wasn't really available. A tremendous amount of my time and energy was wasted, not to mention the emotional roller coaster of landing the job and then having it disappear. Truly disappointed as I had an overwhelming desire to join the team and company. "
I was unaware of where I stood in the application process. This survey is the only thing I heard regarding the position!
"I was treated in a rude and unfair way, by a J&J mail system.
Technology should always be applied ""human centric"".

J&J seems to me an extreme ISTJ company, not tolerant for any other MBTI profiles. It is just a matter of time before J&J will disappear.

I will not tell you how to improve your recruitment process, as I don't work for free."
"I was told to apply to this role as a follow up to an internal recommendation, that I am highly qualified for.  I immediately received a rejection email with what seemed like no review of my resume.  I understand that not every candidate is a match to an organization. However hopefully you can understand my perspective that I don't want to spend my valuable time and intellect answering a survey for a company that did not want to pursue my candidacy.  The only reason I did was because I wanted to the daily emails to answer this survey to stop."
"I was told that the hiring manager was going to go with an internal candidate after I went through two rounds of interviews.  J&J should finish the internal interviewing process before contacting external candidates.  This only creates false hope. I was never told that I was not even being considered for the job anymore until I followed up with the recruiter.  When J&J sends a rejection, it would be nice if they could give a reason such as salary requirements too high, does not have the right skill set, too many applicants (i.e. very competitive).  This would help the applicant as well as J&J for future job matches."
"I was told that I didn't get the job by the recruiter before the interviewer.  After hearing from the recruiter, I then got another automatic email from J&J saying the same thing. Basically I got 2 rejection emails which I thought was unnecessary.  Also, the interviewer was surprised that the recruiter told me before she had the opportunity to. While the interview processes went well, the rejection aspect did not at all."
I was told someone would call me on a Friday. That didn't happen. I called him back on Monday and left a message. I never heard back. 
I was told position was placed on hold 
I was told my presentation and experience was excellent by the Directors and then received a notification without explanation where I fell short that I was not going to be considered for the position.
"I was told I wasn't chosen after my interview. I was never contacted regarding having an interview. I would be more satisfied with the process of i actually had the interview i was told i had. Overall, better communication about the steps that are happening in the process would have been less disappointing. "
"I was told I didn't get the job the first time I interviewed but that the interviewer was very interested in me for the next group of Sr Buyer positions. So I reapplied and never heard back. I was very surprised and disappointed. I even contacted the recruiter who told me to reapply, but she never responded to me.

"I was told by an independent recruiter that J&J was interested, I applied, apparently no interest.  Communication is key here, people deserve to know one way or another where they stand.  Total waste of time
"
"I was told by a J&J insider that my immediate response for not being considered for a position was due to my answering ""no"" to 1 question in the online process.  That is very discouraging to me if I do apply in the future.  I had an internal recommendation and was assured by a couple of J&J employees that I was a strong candidate.  The fact that my CV/application never made it to a hiring manager is disappointing and will most likely deter me from applying again."
"I was told after the initial phone interview with the recruiter that I would be contacted by the hiring manager for a face to face.  I had a great phone interview and the recruiter was thorough and very helpful.  She said that she was impressed with my experience and that I should hear from the hiring manager within a few days.  From there, nothing went well.  I never heard from the hiring manager or anyone else for that matter.  I contacted the recruiter from the phone interview to let her know that I hadn't heard from anyone and was assured it was only a matter of time until the hiring manager reached out, as he had been in meetings for several days.  Bottom line, he never contacted me and based on that, I decided Johnson & Johnson was not a good fit!"
"I was surprised to receive this survey.  I was not contacted at all to discuss the executive assistant position, did not speak with a recruiter, did not interview, and was never told that I was not a good fit.  Someone dropped the ball because I'm an administrative rockstar. "
"I was surprised to receive this survey, given that I did not hear from your recruiters regarding my application."
"I was surprised to receive an email in regards to giving you feedback on how you did because I have yet to receive any feedback in regards to the interview, position filled or a response to my email which was sent for feedback addressed to two different Johnson & Johnson employees I met with. 

My suggestion on improvement is to provide feedback to all potential employees interviewed with Johnson & Johnson, regardless if they are hired or not. This type of feedback let the person know the outcome, possible how they did on the interview and they are not left wondering if the company is still interviewing. I just think communication is they key and says a lot about the company as well as the interviewer."
I was surprised at how quickly the process was. I liked that everything was automated. I think it runs smoothly the way it is.
"I was strung along for several months and never even given the opportunity to interview either in person or via phone. I have significant manufacturing and operations leadership experience, so I was very surprised to not get any feedback. As a hiring manager, I would never have treated a candidate in this manner. "
"I was sent this survey, but other than my sending my resume in to your team for review I have not received any contact from your team except for this survey.  I would be unfair for me to have an input on this as I did not go through any screening or discussions with your team."
I was sent this survey even though I never received a call.  I have applied for a few roles at J & J without ever receiving a call.  This is the most communication I have had with you.  I strongly suggest you get your systems coordinated because I really don't think my feedback is what you are looking for.
I was sent the last two survey's without being contacted by any recruiters or hearing back about the role in question.
"I was sent an email at 9:38 a.m. regarding an Ethicon position that I applied for with the link to fill out further information.  When I opened the email and tried the link at 1:50 p.m. the same day; the link would not open.  A couple days later I received an email stating that I was not chosen for the position.  

I may have been chosen for the position if I had been able to open the link and proceed further.

So, with this feedback someone needs to figure out what happened in my case and either tell me that my efforts are futile or the reason that I was not chose.  Thank you!"
"I was sent a notice on Nov 30th confirming my application for the position.  I have not had any communication with anyone on my acceptance or denial of candidacy, therefore it is difficult to give a more than favorable review.  At this point, I am indifferent about my experience with J&J."
"I was sent a form rejection letter thanking me for visiting JNJ for my interview where in fact I have never been invited for an interview.
Someone with a scientific background should read the resumes for research positions."
"I was scheduled for a phone interview with the manager. He didn't call me at the scheduled time. I had to call his secretary to find out what happened as nobody informed me he would be late calling me. He was 15 late and as soon as he got on the call he informed me he had a hard stop 15 minutes later, which didn't give me much time to talk about my experiences and ask questions. After the call I didn't hear back for weeks, at which time I received a email indicating the company would not be proceeding with my application. Based on the above, I believe an internal candidate was already identified and my candidacy was never given any serious consideration."
I was satisfied with the process.
I was satisfied with my experience and look forward to opportunities that match my skills and qualifications.  
"I was referred to a position by the head of your pain research group, a PHD with a long history with J&J.  My background dovetailed perfectly with the portfolio manager equities position, I managed one of the largest small cap value funds in the nation at the world's largest asset manager.  It is beyond me why I was never contacted, I assure you that that very few candidates had the institutional experience I have.  It really begs to question what you were looking for or perhaps the position was filled and the posting was a formality.  I guarantee that the person in the job does not have a fraction of the experience I have in the institutional mutual fund world.  Additionally, I know the PHD that referred me to J&J is embarrassed by your lack of organizational follow up.  Honestly, J&J's credo and culture strike me as a farce after this experience.  "
"I was referred to a position by a current employee. I received the referral email. When I tried to log on to your site with my special emailed username and password, it denied me. I went ahead and applied for the position on my own without the referral. I also emailed the recruiter. Have not heard back from the recruiter. 
What should my next step be? It was for another position, rather than this specific position "
I was referred from an internal candidate and no one ever contacted me. I'm surprised I received the email asking for a survey.  I'm sure Alex Gorski would be disappointed in the lack of follow up from the recruiting team. 
"I was referred by two employees and not even a letter that personalized my application process.  Extremely unhappy with the response without even speaking with me.  I KNOW I have the qualifications and skills for the position.  The only way to gauge whether I fit into the organization is to reach out to candidates like me and speak with them, especially those in HR.  The only story I tell myself, was it my age?

"
"I was referred by an employee. There might have been a glitch in the system as I was never called for interviews or even been contacted by a Johnson & Johnson recruiter.

My opinion on 2 of the questions are solely based on the fact that I am an ex- employee of Johnson & Johnson and do have the company in high regard.

Thank you."
"I was referred by a former colleague and current J&J employee so was disappointed that I did not at least get a phone call, especially since my background should have been a very strong fit for the role. "
I was recommended for several positions by an internal employee. Not once was there any contact with me to discuss why I might not fit position.
"I was recommended for a position by a friend who works for J&J, and received an email recruiting me.  But before I could even apply, I received another email telling me that you had decided I wasn't what you were looking for.  I received a survey asking me what I thought about the process.  I went to your website and saw that the position was still posted,  so I applied and alas, I did not hear from you.    I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss what I can bring to your company.  I LOVE Exuviance skincare and am already well versed in the products, and because I not only use the products but believe in them, my SPH is above average.  I have worked for Ulta for 6 years, so I am very familiar with their protocol and my events are always successful."
I was qualified for the job and no one reached out to me
"I was qualified as an applicant (4 years as a clinical specialist) and didn't even receive a phone call or email.  My last two positions were short stints in very small startups and irrelevant to the job description.  I've always heard great things about J&J, but I've never been giving the time or opportunity to speak with anyone.  Maybe next time perhaps.  I'm currently seeking a quality company where I can be exposed to a career opportunity and do great work and build on my skill sets."
I was only told that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue my candidacy. Some reasons or feedback would be appreciated. 
"I was only told that JNJ decided not to consider me for the job.  I was never informed as to what aspect of my resume was not a good fit.  This is discouraging as I do not know what more it needed to become a favorable candidate.  I met all the requirements, so... not quite sure why I was not even given a phone screen.  Anyway, JNJ has a good reputation and maybe I will continue to look at your opening.  Thanks, Cindy"
"I was offered the position as the #1 candidate.  The initial conversation with HR around compensation after the position was extended to me was awkward and not straight forward.  

The next conversation I had around compensation was with the hiring manager a week later.  I really wanted to work for her and she mentioned she would get back to me around what could be done with compensation.   I never heard from her or anyone else at Janssen.  

The entire process was a bit ""off""."
"I was notified by email that ""the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position"", I was not given a reason as to why I was not chosen. "
"I was not setup for a phone interview as I had expected. And only received email telling me I was not a fit. Usually recruiters will not set you for a position unless there is a high probability you will at least get a phone interview. Without any specific feedback, I am unsure how to improve my resume for any future positions."
"I was not selected for the position
I reached-out to the vacancy owner and HR contact for a short follow-up call to receive some feedback on my application performance and some additional background why I was not selected but did not succeed to get an appointment for this purpose"
"I was not selected for any interview, so I'm not sure why I'm receiving this survey."
I was not selected for an interview. I never heard back from a recruiter. I would love the opportunity to work at JNJ! I filled out this survey anyway. 
"I was not selected  to interview for this role, so I would not expect or fault the recruiter for not calling me about the role or to explain the process. Perhaps a dashboard to give a high level overview of the application status would be helpful.  A follow up call would be nice but may be unrealistic for the recruiter to call every applicant. "
I was not recruited
"I was not reach out by the recruiter.
"
"I was not picked for an interview for the Quoting Analyst, Deal Desk.  I have 5 years experience in the Contracts group.  And I have a wealth of experience with DePuy and I believe I would be a strong candidate.  Fast learning, great history and very adaptable to a new learning experience. "
"I was not picked for an interview for the Deployment Analyst . And I have a wealth of experience with DePuy and I believe I would be a strong candidate.  Fast learning, great history and very adaptable to a new learning experience.

"I was not part of a ""recruiting process"" beyond receiving a system generated email that my application was being reviewed, and several weeks (probably around 16-20 weeks) I was notified by another system email that my application was not being moved forward.  I was never part of a phone screen, interview, etc., so I probably should not have received this survey. "
I was not ontacted
"I was not notified that I was not being considered for the opportunity. I am a previous employee, I would expect that I would be given consideration for opportunities to speak with a HR representative, as to areas I could be considered for future employment."
"I was not invited for an interview, and I'm disappointed that there might have been a missed opportunity because no one has put the effort to communicate with me.
Would appreciate an explanation.
Thank you

I was not informed on any reason as to why I was not a good fit for the open positions. It's very frustrating to put time in to applying for a company you really want to work for and not to hear directly from someone who can help you better prepare or market yourself for the next time you apply for one of there open positions. 
I was not given any feedback as to why i was not contacted
"I was not even given an opportunity to talk to anyone at all. I was just sent a rejection email. I was told by friends that are field sales representatives with J&J that the manager wanted someone who lived in the city of Huntsville and I live within 25 minutes of Huntsville, Alabama. I have called on Huntsville and surrounding area physician offices with great success. He missed a good opportunity to interview and possibly hire a very successful pharmaceutical sales specialist. I could have gained J&J successful business with the good solid relationships I have in this territory and my honors and awards working for AstraZeneca are just some of the demonstrations of these successes. It's a shame our world has eliminated many good potential employees by use of software/computers before getting to really know the people at the end of a resume or application. I even have a recommendation from the CEO of Novartis (Paul Hudson) who worked with me at AstraZeneca.Should you want to contact me my number is 256-303-3578. Jessica Tate"
I was not contacted.  I am confused a bit by this latest email.  I applied some time ago. Would very much appreciate a call. 610-529-8151. 
"I was not contacted, although I believe that in this niche there are few others in the country with better qualification.  Some of the questionnaire as part of the application alludes to skills which I have exposure to but had to say no to as I did not perform them directly but performed the Windchill Implementations and Upgrades for Medical device companies who had dedicated staff taking on those responsibilities within my project.  Maybe others would have just checked the boxes yes but I don't believe exposure = experience.  I believe this may be why I was not contacted.  Bottom line is, reduce the black and white screening checkboxes in the application and read peoples resume, and even give them a call on these niche roles.

"
I was not contacted via phone.  I received the email many months later.  Not sure what the delay was. 
"I was not contacted in regards to this position nor most other positions I applied to.  The most contact I've received was an automated, generic message saying ""someone else was picked.""  While individual messages might be too taxing on the recruiters (especially in such a flooded market), sometimes a better message than what everyone else sends is appreciated."
I was not contacted for this position. I suspect I should not have received this survey. I find the recruitment process to be a black hole.
"I was not contacted for this position. I applied, but did not interview. I would like to interview.

"I was not contacted for this position but I had good experiences with the recruitment in the past, I received feedback and recommendations to improve my strengths."
"I was not contacted for this job, and only received the general rejection e-mail, so the first few questions were not relevant. 

I would like feedback on how I can increase my chance of being hired by JnJ. "
"I was not contacted for even a phone screen, as I apparently possibly fell through the cracks?
A friend of mine, From my company go the job with no Oncology experience.
She did however have an inside contact. She is a great hire but frankly with my experience and background, I was disappointed to have not been contacted.
I applied for hematology and solid tumor opportunities and never spoke with a live person regarding either. Meanwhile, I've had 3 interviews with Genentech so I know I am a viable candidate.
Thank you!

I was not contacted by anyone on the recruiting team. I was send a blanket rejection email.

I was not contacted by a recruiter during the application process. I found the job posting on LinkedIn and applied on my own.
"I was not contacted by a recruiter but was informed through a J&J  email for my not being a fit for this role in spite of my having very deep experience in many facets of technology.  I do view J&J as a leader and desirable company. Hopefully, at some point, I will be able to meet directly with your recruiters and management."
I was not contacted by a recruiter at any time for any position at Johnson & Johnson.
I was not contacted by a recruiter
I was not contacted at all during the process.  I received an automatic email that I was not chosen for the position.  I emailed the recruiter asking why I did not even get an interview and I never received a reply.
I was not contacted about this role so I am not sure why I was asked to complete this survey.  I went through the interview process several months ago about another position but heard nothing back on that one either.  I would recommend more of a commitment to communication would help prospective candidates.  The overall process and length of time from application to notification (if ever) is so lengthy that an applicant does not feel valued.
"I was not contacted about this position after applying, but would have appreciated the opportunity."
"I was not contacted 
Therefore I guess that calling is a good start.

"
"I was not considered for this position, and I did not have any interviews ( I believe my professional skills do not fit to this position).
It should be a item to be added in this survey."
"I was not communicated with at any point in the process.  I have been told by my current manager that the VP who was the hiring manager for the position was impressed by my resume and that I am highly regarded.  I may not have been seen as the right fit for this position, but no one ever spoke to me or gave me any chance to demonstrate by ability to meet the requirements."
"I was not chosen for an interview. I applied for an opening online, completed an online assessment and was later notified by email that the position had been canceled.  "
I was not called or emailed.  I find it odd I am receiving this request.
"I was not called for the interview/technical discussion unfortunately, even though i was reffered by the Data management leader from J&J. I understand that it is difficult to call everyone or shortlist, however the refferred candidates must be given a chance for the interview. "
"I was not called for the interview. For this reason, my answers are neutral. "
"I was not called for interview despite having more than required qualifications, experience skills and expertise.

Commuications indicated the posistion had been put on hold but later it transpires interviews were indeed held. 

Preference was given to personnel outside of J&J/my department indicating a lack of committment to existing highly skilled staff."
"I was not aware I formally applied, but then received a rejection notice."
"I was not a part of a ""recruitment"" process. I simply looked on the company's website, found the job posting and applied. That was the only contact I had.

Thank you-"
I was not  contacted by a recruiter.  I was a contract employee already working for the manager.  The manager was unprofessional.
"I was never told that my application would not be pursued, this is the first contact I have had from the company since submitting an application
Not really the best way to tell people"
I was never spoken to in relation to a position.
I was never spoken to even though I am the perfect candidate. I feel we both missed a great opportunity.
I was never selected for the interview. I believe that it's a discrimination due to not having a referral candidate. 
I was never screened or interviewed for this job.  I was not contacted or updated after I posted for the position... this survey is a bit odd to me.
I was never notified that I was rejected for this role. 
I was never moved forward for an interview in the process so the survey is not applicable - not sure why I have received it without getting an interview.
I was never invited for the recruitment process.
"I was never invited for an interview or interviewed by Johnson & Johnson. However, I did receive e-mail stating ""Following your interview for the position of Health Care Compliance Investigations Lead Analyst (3199161207), the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy."" I could not respond to the e-mail since it was sent from 'invalid' e-mail address. "

I was never Interviewed
I was never informed that I didn't qualify.
"I was never informed on whether or not i recieved an interview or not even considered for the job or jobs i have applied for .   I feel like i was very much qualified for several of the jobs i have applied for and never gotten a response from anyone as to whether i was a fit for the job or and interview or why i was not considered for the job.   It would be nice if the recruters would at least email or call to let you know where you stand in reciveing or not recieving the job or jobs you have applied for .  I think this information better helps when trying to bid in on future jobs to be hired on as an Ethicon employee.  I have been told that i am good at what i do and that i should have no problem getting a job here at Ethicon.  I have applied for several jobs but recieved not the first bit of info on why i did not recieve an interview or why i didnt get a job .  Thanks for your time in reading this and i hope to see a difference in giving this information.

"I was never given the opportunity to interview for the position. I was not contacted by the recruiting department nor a recruiter. I found out in the hallway that this person was given the job. I was not told by a Recruiting member or HR member, this was just a group of people chatting. She was from J&J but not our sector. The process is broken and really needs to be addressed as the reason why and how to fix.  Yes, I would recommend J&J for my family and friends. I have years with J&J, I have never worked at any other company, but I know the recruiting process is bad. It is usually who you know that you get the position. It is normally filled prior to posting.  Other than J&J is an excellent company and I am proud to say that I have been given the opportunity to work for this great company."
"I was never extended an interview for the position; however, I am still interested in future opportunities with Johnson & Johnson. "
I was never even notified that the position had been filled. It would be great to have a link that provides the status of your application. 
I was never even contacted for a phone screen for this position !!! So I am surprised to get this survey link.
"I was never even contacted by anyone at Johnson & Johnson. Ever. I sent emails to find out the status of my application and received no reply at all. I don't even know why I'm getting this survey because I didn't even go through the recruitment process. I would really like to work for Johnson & Johnson, but I'm disappointed by how things went. "

I was never contacted regarding any interview for this position. In fact I have made several applications with no interview despite my extensive experience.

I was never contacted or interviewed for this position. Perhaps improve the connection between the lack of interview or even contact and this survey process. There is a terrible disconnect within your HR and recruiting processes.

I received multiple offers from other employers for similar or positions of greater responsibility. I accepted a position as General Counsel and am quite pleased with the decision.
I think very highly of J & J, yet the on-line recruiting systems leaves a great, great deal to be desired. A simple, personal response was certainly called for, especially for this level of a position."

I know J&J is a huge company and Thousand of people can apply regularly so it is frustrating but I kind of understand.

For other positions, I did not receive response other than ""thank you, we received your application etc"". This survey seems to be for the same position I have already submitted survey after the video interview-but here was no further communication from J&J nor subsequent interview. There is a glitch somewhere in your system that sends interview survey questionnaire to candidates who have never had an interview. You are a great company and your hiring process must show that as it is the first glimpse of the company  candidates will have. Please fix this glitch-I get excited every time I get survey because I think it is an announcement of the interview...Regards and all the best in your future! "

I was never contacted by the recruiter nor received any notice from the Company that I was not a good fit. Quite frankly I'm a bit confused as to why I'm getting this survey when I haven't gone through the recruitment process and equally surprised that I would be notified in this manner. Your HR team needs to do a better job in being organized and reaching out to prospective candidates. I would not recommend J&J as a leader or Company to work for if this is how you treat people who have applied for jobs. This is why a lot of highly qualified pharmaceutical professionals leave big pharma to work for smaller pharmas where they are treated as human beings.
I was never contacted by the recruiter for the position. The hiring manager contacted me directly for a chat and then set up an interview with him and his team. It was also the hiring manager who contacted me to tell me that I did not get the position and why. The recruiter was never involved with this process for this position.

I was never contacted by Johnson & Johnson after applying for the positions.

I was left hanging for a few weeks waiting to Schedule an interview with the hiring manager. I contacted the recruiter to find out why I hadn't heard back yet and she tried to help me but still kept me hanging until I received an general email several weeks later explaining that the position had been moved to Vancouver.  I felt that the way this was handled was in poor taste. 
I was led through 4 separate interviews where I had to take time off.  Please try to group interviews so candidates do not have to invest so much time.   Communication was poor and no feedback was given.  
"I was invited specifically to apply for this position because it was determined to be a much better fit than another position I originally applied for within the same group.  Yet when it was decided that an internal resource was a better fit for this position, I was not given any feedback on the decision process, and in fact was only told that I didn't get the job when I contacted the recruiter directly after a few weeks.  While I can understand that an internal resource would be a better fit, it would be very helpful to have some kind of feedback. "

The hiring manager for the position was also very professional (Preeti Kanoji, Field Director MSL Solild Tumor for Janssen Oncology). I would also like to go on record and praise the professionalism and integrity of Jannell DePalantino and Amy Jurek, both are Field Directors for MSL Hematology Team for Janssen Oncology. J&J should recognize each of these individuals for representing J&J. Even though I was not the right fit for the specific position, they represented the company in the highest standard. J&J should be proud and lucky to have them on their team!  "
I was interviewed in August of 2016.  I received no feedback until a rejection letter was received a week ago in February of 2017.  Pretty terrible treatment of a well qualified corporate manager.  
I was internally recommended for this position and did not apply to it. Results may be skewed. I never pursued the position after recommendation. 
"I was impressed with the enrollment process in that the application was comprehensive and easy to move through. I also appreciated that I was notified when I was not selected as this is extremely rare and does allow for closure in the process.  I understand that a phone call or personal email is not practical due to the large volume of applicants that I am sure your receive but would be highly appreciated whenever possible. Thank you for requesting my input.

"I was impressed to receive the survey after applying to the External Supply Quality position. This email demonstrate the J & J is interested in her future employees to have them engaged from the very first moment.

Good sign for sure!"
"I was highly recommended by several current Johnson & Johnson employees.  I did not even get a interview.  I'm currently covering 13 hospitals for a great company.  I had a fair shot of employment, i.e.  phone call, face to face interview and able to close the deal.  Johnson and Johnson was just one big blank.  Not impressed with the whole process and now several months later you send me a survey, yikes. "
I was highly qualified for this position and never received a call Even though the recruiter was instructed to call me by the district manager Very disappointed in your process 
"I was highly qualified for the program and didn't even get a contact. Feels like they focus soley on job fairs at schools and not students or recent grads at other places who have the experience , grades and aptitude . "
"I was highly qualified for the position.  I suspect that the hiring manager did not want me as a direct report.  the reason I was given that I would be taking a step back in my career.  I am at a point in my work career that I am not looking for ""advancement"" but for a job that I like and can contribute.  I knew the title when I applied, so using that as an excuse not to be interviewed, beyond the recruiter was very weak.

Feel free to call me at 925 216 7735

"
I was happy with the recruitment process.
"I was happy with the level of communication from Johnson & Johnson. Ultimately, the position for which I applied was canceled due to changing business needs. I was impressed with the email communication letting me know of this change. There appears to be many opportunities in the Johnson & Johnson community."
I was getting emails after I got the rejection letter telling me my resume was under review for the job- it was very confusing.  No feedback was given at all.
"I was frustrated by the recruitment process because I was interviewing for this position in the Data Sciences department after I interviewed with the Statistics group.  I received an offer from the Statistics group while I was in the middle of the interview process for Data Sciences.  Instead of extending my offer reply deadline beyond 1 week and allowing me to finish my interviews with Data Sciences and make a decision between the two (if I received a 2nd offer), the interview process was abruptly stopped once I told my contact in HR that I was interviewing in another department.  This was very frustrating to me and I feel like the HR rep went behind my back when I was being honest about my situation."
"I was excluded because of salary requirements thats what was told to me.  I felt my requirements were more than reasonable living in an expensive city like Vancouver.  I hope in the future that I am considered and taken further through the process.

Thank you"
"I was displaced from J & J as a result of large downsizing in our organization.  Considering that I have had good ratings and was actively apply for other positions with in J&J I was only called to interview for 1 position that I was directly referred to the hiring manager for.  

I had not received any outreach to schedule interviews or feedback from any recruiter on why I was not selected to move to an interview.  Very disappointing for a displaced employee with a good work history in the organization."
I was disappointed that I was not considered for this position  and did not receive even a telephone interview.  I believe my qualifications and experience made me an ideal candidate for this position.  I find the application process to be very difficult at Johnson and Johnson with little to no feedback on why I was not considered.  Thank you 
"I was disappointed in the HR screening interview as I felt the recruiter had spent little time reviewing my resume before the call and likely did not read the cover letter at all.  I say this because when I asked her what it was that she saw in my application that caused her to phone me, all she could say was it was because an employee had recommended me. Nothing about my skills or experience or background or what I had written in bullets about what I offered J&J in the cover letter.  It felt like a very weak answer that showed very little interest in me.  Much as I tried to establish a rapport with her, she seemed only to be going through the motions.  I unfortunately was not that surprised when I was not passed through to the next phase."
"I was curious to get this survey because I never received any follow up to the job posting other than the survey. I believe right after I applied I got an auto generated note but nothing further. Since then, only 3-4 requests to complete the survey. kind of funny. "
"I was contacted in September to have a telephone interview.  After the telephone interview I was advised that I would be contacted by the internal recruiter shortly. 
I did not hear anything from anyone from Johnson and Johnson for months afterwards and the response was a generic ""thanks, but no thanks"" email."
I was contacted by the recruiter in timely manner.  it was communicated to me that the talent pool would be selected from a geography closer to the area vs considering a current representative from Wisconsin.
I was contacted by one of the interviewers that I didn't get the position.  No one from HR or Recruiting ever contacted me with respect to feedback on my interview.
I was contacted by Markitza for a Supplier Quality Engineer position. Never heard back from her even though I followed up with emails
I was contacted by email telling me I was chosen for an interview.  There was no explanation as to why.  Any kind of explanation would have been helpful to me.  I believe my current salary was a reason as to why I was not offered an interview but I will never know because there was no explanation.
"I was contacted by a JnJ Talent Acquisition who asked for time that I was available.  I provided that information but no one ever contacted me.  I was/am very interested in a SQE position at JnJ.  

I received an email months later saying thank you for the interview, but JnJ decided to go with someone else.  

As stated, no one every contacted me after that first initial when can you talk.

"I was contacted and asked to participate in 8 phone interviews before having an interview with the hiring manager. After I have completed all 8 interviews I never heard back. I have contacted recruiter a couple of times and only after 3 months she came back with a reply that the position was filled. 

The whole process was disappointing to say the least since I spent 8 hours of my time only to be completely ignored later."
"I was being interviewed for the position of Clinical Associate in one of the medical devices companies of the J&J family last year. The process took 3.5 months and I made it to the final stage.
After that long process, nobody contacted me to give a feedback. I had not even received any rejection letter. I contacted myself the recruiting manager, to know that another person had been hired.
Hope such a reputable company is able to keep high standards of treating potential candidates with respect even in an overcrowded job market.

Sincerely,"
"I was asked so many questions. I had the feeling almost immediately that one interviewer was not fond of me. Why drag on the interview for 45 minutes? I had to wait in the reception area for about 10 minutes, which it appeared to the interviewers that I was late. I wasn't. Granted, they chose another candidate. That's fine; but, I did not receive a J&J email for 3 weeks. Also, my interview was in February. Why are you sending me this survey in May stating that I had a 'recently' interviewed? "
"I was approached to apply, replied back and had several questions. I was told I had to complete an application on line and she would get back to me regarding my questions. After taking time to click through your online process that essentially involved retyping my resume into your records, I received a generic email saying I was not qualified for consideration. This was less than 12 hours after I clicked submit.  Quite puzzling...since my resume is what piqued the initial contact, I assume. Not impressed with the lack of follow through. I have been approached by several recruiters in the past several months and my encounter with your company revealed your methods are below the bar.  Kindest regards and good luck in your future talent search for your company. "
"I was an on-site contractor, and, despite being qualified, was not granted an interview because there were contractors that had been there longer.  I felt the process was highly biased and political."
"I was an internal referral, but I did not have anyone reach out to me via phone or email for the position."
"I was an internal referral and once I submitted online application, I never heard another word from anyone.  Your employeee who referred me was left out of loop as well"
"I was an internal candidate, I would have like to at least had a chance to have a brief conversation with the hiring manager.  As a candidate that met all of the job requirements I think this is a courtesy that should have been extended.

I know there is an effort to make the experience better but I have continually been frustrated with the internal process for exploring opportunities.  We like to talk about how great it is but my experiences have been anything but great."
"I was an internal candidate who (was encouraged) to apply, however since I had not been within the organisation for long enough (&lt; 2 years) I was not considered for this role. This should be clearly indicated so that these types of situations can be avoided as it can be very demoralising.  "
"I was able to speak with the hiring manager (VP) in a phone interview.  While I would have appreciated getting to the next level with an in-person interview, I understand my leadership profile wasn't an ideal match for the Sr. Director position.  

Admittedly, I was disappointed not to have had the chance to be part of the in-person interview process.  I am confident my leadership experience and extensive capabilities and expertise in the commercial environment would have been more apparent with added verbal/non-verbal context beyond a phone screen.

I remain highly interested in Johnson & Johnson.  Thank you for your willingness to receive feedback of the recruitment & interview process.  The recruitment team was excellent and a pleasure to work with.

"I was a TM1 consultant at Johnson & Johnson for six month working for an india based consulting firm, I also have over 10 years of Financial Analyst experience, I applied for a sr. financial analyst - TM1 position, the end result is just an email stating that I am not a good fit, JnJ's TM1 recruitment is not transparent enough, the position was probably filled by people with internal connection to the hiring manager,not by direct work experience, credential and merits. "
I was a referral from Director Kristin Wallace for an HR Employee/Labor Relations position in Somerville NJ. i was excited about applying for the position as this is my area of specialization. I was contacted via email by Jamie regarding the referral/position but never heard back from the her. I sent a follow up email to inquire about the position but my email was not answered. I was disappointed in the lack of follow up.  The thanks Joella 
"I was a referral from an employee, am ranked #2 in the nation for all of 2017 and finished #2 for 2016, have strong relationships with my customers whereas I can get in many places that others cant, have oncology experience and have a biology/pharmacy background so it was very disappointing  I never even got a call for a screening. I am just perplexed!"
"I was a little surprised that after applying (and being qualified) for an executive level position- no emails, no calls, no contact. Several months later I received the generic rejection email.  As an HR executive, I have to admit I was a little surprised coming from a giant like J&J. "
"I was a great fit for the position I applied for, certainly worthy of a follow up contact and an initial conversation.  Instead, I never heard from J&J's recruiter after reaching out multiple times, as well as contacting a recruiter with a direct message on LinkedIn.  

A missed opportunity for J&J, for sure.

"I was a full time happy and successful employee with J&J for many years. I do not have a college degree but do have a proven performance. 

The recommendation for improvement is to give consideration to allow Hiring managers to see resumes of qualified candidates who left J&J with a excellent standing. 

Thank You

I want an interview. And then the job

"I used to work for Lifescan, as a regular  and as a contractor employee for (13+ yrs). I really liked the company.  My expertise is in marketing, product/program management and marketing communications,  but I also know aspects of operations as well as working throughout the company to get things done. I have a BS as well as an MBA degree. I thought I would at least get to talk to a recruiter about coming back. Anyway, its over and done with isn't it? "
I used to work for Johnson and Johnson as a contractor and I truly enjoyed working there.  J&J should consider candidates that have already worked there in the past since I'm already familiar with J&J working environment.
"I underwent 3 telephone interviews for the r￼ole applied for several months ago. I never heard back on the role. This was a role I was very keen on and was most disappointed to not hear back even if the answer was not a positive one.

"I understand you have lots of applicants but for those with obvious skills and competencies for the position, a reason for not following up would be appreciated. 

In my case, I even had an internal referral with the hiring manager...  I found this lack of followup simply unfortunate. 

If the position was filled from within or possible already labelled for internal candidates, a simple mention un the rile description would be a good start. 

Thank you for asking..."
"I understand there are many candidates applying for positions, but I never get an interview if my job responsibilities fit exactly what J&J requires. I do like that you still send out emails.  It shows professionalism."
I understand the recruiting process is extremely difficult on all of us. I would love to get SOME/ANY feedback from a submission. It would save everyone involved many hours if the recruiter would lead the applicant in the right direction or at least give honest feedback as to why the applicant is not a good fit. I am so tired of submitting and not getting ANY feedback whatsoever. 
"I understand the process, but I have applied to at least 5 jobs at J&J, and have never rec'd any interest back.  that is ok, that is your prerogative, however, I would like you now that you are missing out on a great resource!

"I understand the number of applications for each position, but recruitment team should help the applicants to know the status of the applications. It would help the applicants to plan accordingly. Thank you. Sasidhar."
"I understand the high volume of applicants a company such as johnson and johnson recieves and it would be very hard to contact every prospective applicant, but it really does make the difference in how your viewed.
Sometimes and honest evaluation of why your not qualified is all some applicants are looking for instead of feeling like our resumes only go into a black hole and no one ever really  views it."
I understand the first person in the recruiting process has to filter out candidates. But my experience and capability go far beyond what can be read by a scan of a resume. You missed an opportunity with my candidacy. Whomever you moved forward with may be excellent. But not giving me a 30 minute phone screen was a missed opportunity.
"I understand the challenges of sorting applicants when you receive 100s of resumes for every job. But many times, the structure of the on-line application and resume formats don't bring out the true commitment, capabilities and passion of the job applicant. Include a few questions that focus on the creative and innovative quotient of the candidate. You simply might end up with a more productive employee who also exemplars in best in humanity."
I understand that you receive thousands of resumes and applications. I have signed up to receive job alerts with the talent community. I have not received any alerts but when I go on I see positions that meets the search criteria that I have set up. Maybe the system can be revamped to work better. Thanks 
I understand that you receive large number of applications but to receive an email in such a short time after applying seems that it is computer generated and that you would be missing out on excellent candidates 
"I understand that you must get an extensive number of applications on a daily basis for all open positions at J&J - for positions that are Director level and above, I would suggest at least a personal email - rather than just 'you did not meet the requirements'"
"I understand that with the ease of applying, it is not practical to review and provide feedback to each applicant, but the response I received was, ""We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Senior Analyst Supply Chain Customer Solutions (6580170117) at Johnson & Johnson HCS Inc""  I would guess I didn't have the right key words in my resume, but I suspect no one actually looked at my qualifications or background. J&J is not unique in this issue, and I don't have a solution with the use of automatic candidate screening tools out there, but I think companies that don't take the time to review candidates miss out on good talent."
"I understand that two other candidates were chosen?
Then neither accepted the position.

I would have loved the position I applied for,  and thought I was a great fit.
Tony Odell whom I interviewed with was fantastic,  and he seemed like a terrific manager to work for.  
He claimed my interviews went well  - and gave me a lot of accolades. 

Then I was told no go - then I saw the position re-posted. 

I would have loved to be given the chance for the consumables position. !"
"I understand that there are a plethora of candidates for each position, however, a more personal email explaining why someone was not chosen would be helpful."
"I understand that the recruitment process is well structure, for the company needs to ensure that good candidates will fill the vacancy positions. Great job! Thanks for reviewing my resume."
I understand that many people may apply to these positions and I appreciate at least getting a response as to whether my application would move forward or not. It would be nice to know the reason behind the rejection.
"I understand that Johnson & Johnson gets a lot of applications and it is not possible to respond to everyone. However, for professional level positions, I would at least like to opportunity to discuss with a recruiter or someone in HR about what I need to do or be looking for to potentially work there. Again, I understand this couldn't be expected for entry level positions, but the positions that I've been applying for are not that. Thanks and I hope this doesn't come across the wrong way. Johnson & Johnson is just somewhere that I could see myself. Thanks,

"I understand that J&J gets thousands of resumes and applicants. The email I received after applying for this position was appropriate but the questions about joining J&Js talent community was only answered in the reply email I received by stating that I could visit the career site on your website anytime to search for other opportunities.

Thank you for sending this survey, it enhances my view of J&J as a potential employer. 

Chris Ward"
"I understand that it's nearly impossible to actually have a conversation with perspective candidates but this is primarily the only way to have a more appropriate way for candidate selection.  Instructional design is an imerging field with manyof it's practitioners engaged in roles outside of the definition of IDT.  To delegate the responsibilities of go through resumes automatically without an actual diolog does not seem most appropriate for meeting the hiring objectives.  That is to find the best qualified cadidate.  May I suggest, campus job fair participation and/or engaging university staff for candidate selection.  It would increase the level of a much needed dialoge for the field of IDT."
"I understand that it is difficult to speak to people individually when looking to fill a position. However, getting a generic ""we decided to pursue someone with other skills"" gives me no information of where I am falling short or what I could do to improve. I believe I would have been great in this role but I have no way of talking to anyone internally about it in the current system."
I understand it is a difficult process and to be honest I wish I had the answers.  
"I understand I was not the candidate the hiring manager was looking for in terms of skill sets but i hope my resume will stay on file with the recruiters at Johnson and Johnson.  It would be great to hear of opportunities from the recruiters who feel your background may fit another open position within the company.  I have many years of meeting management, physician and surgeon education, managing a preceptorship program and experience with managing grants for both pharma and medical device.  I think it would be great to see recruiters looking at our other open positions within J&J that could potentially be a good fit. "
"I understand how hard it is in this day and age to respond to every resume or application that you receive for a position, but I believe that personal connection letting candidates know why they weren't chosen is missing from the recruitment process.  Unfortunately, this goes for most companies and corporations these days and not just Johnson & Johnson."
I understand every applicat for a position cannot be contacted but I strongly feel current JNJ employees should be contacted regardless of whether they are moved forward in the process.. 
I understand degrees are important but 12 yrs of experience in being top salesman should at least get an interview even if by phone.   I have worked with people who had that degree and were not top performers. They moved on to pharmaceutical sales bc of that degree and only having a couple yrs experience. 
I try to full out these surveys in hopes of hearing back from your company.  I have not heard back from any recruiter about being either accepted or rejected.  I would really like to get into the company someway some how either some position that revolves around my education or a coop in a related field.
"I truly can't remember the recruiter or process. If you want to improve you needto start by being memorable, sales 101. I guess that's why you over looked me after I just finished a year in the top 11%. "
"I tried more than 10 times and I have never been asked to the next step for any opportunity even as executive assistant, or compliance or administrative minor position. I concluded that it could be my age, but if they don't call me, how to realize that I could work with excellence for more 10 years at least!?
I believe that recruiters should really try more ""diversity"" in their process..
Thank you for this opportunity.

"
"I tried for two years to obtain an accounting position at J&J until I discovered that
it is extremely rare for someone from the outside to be hired.  Huge waste of time. "
"I thought the recruitment process went very well for the interview. I mostly was in touch with the hiring manager though, not a recruiter. "
I thought the process was very well structured.   Thank you for contacting me.
"I thought the process was handled professionally and represented the quality company that JNJ really is. Although I didnt get the position,  The reason was explained to me in detail by the hiring manager, a rare occurrence in this industry and JNJ should be commended as such.  "
"I thought the process was a good one.  Unfortunately I was not selected. The interviewer and Recuiter were very encouraging.  I would like to know what would make me a stronger candidate for a future opportunity or what disqualified me for this opportunity.

I have held Johnson & Johnson in high esteem as a desirable company to work for. I'm very interested in learning what I can do to become a candidate the company desires as well. "
"I thought the overall process was good however the time from the initial interview to notification of the final decision was very lengthy.

"
"I thought the job description was accurate and the process was simple.  I wish I had the opportunity to work there and hopefully, there will be a chance in the future."
I thought the interview went fairly well but he told me he would call and he never did and after a week I received a standard letter thanking me for interviewing when I wanted to ask him what I could do to get a sales job since I've been out of the industry for over 10 years.
"I thought the interview process was very lengthy.  I personally believe that phone interviews are not always the best measure of a candidate.  I wish I had the opportunity to meet the respective Managers and Recruitment staff. 

In the future I hope to have the oportunity to interview with Johnson and Johnson as it is a company I would enjoy working for.  "
I thought it was well thought out and did not need any improvements.
I thought it was very strange to have a face to face interview and never hear back from anyone.  I sent an email to the hiring manager 3 weeks later and still did not hear anything.  
"I thought it was poor that the  web application asks for your current salary, and I work on a 100% commission basis, and there's no way to reflect my actual income level. When it asks for a base salary, I put in zero because that's my current base salary, and I wonder if that disqualifies me for a particular position. Since no one ever followed up with me to tell me why my application was denied I'll never know."
"I think, the recruiter should have emailed me regarding the rejection, because till now I have not received any email regarding it. but I am a fan of Johnson and Johnson brand and the products. "
I think your process is ok.
"I think your process is done almost to perfection, and I wouldn't change anything."
I think you should at least let someone know when they are not being considered for a position.  I am not even sure why I am receiving this survey since all I received from you was and electronic email saying that you got my application.  
I think you recruitment website is top notch - super easy to use
I think you are already doing well.
I think very highly of J&J. I would have greatly appreciated an interview because I am highly qualified or atleast a phone interview. Thanks 
"I think this was sent to me in error.  I did not have any contact with a recruiter.

Thanks!"
"I think this surveys provide great insight. to the HR team. But I was never contacted, so all the questions about interview and assessments, are not reflecting the reality of my process. "
I think this survey was sent in error as I was not contacted to interview for this position so I answered the questions in a neutral manner.  I was not contacted by the recruiter. My only correspondence was this survey.  
I think this survey is an EXCELLENT idea. 
I think this survey doesn't apply for me because I've never been called for an interview.
I think this is the first notification that I was not considered for the referenced position.
I think thie was a mistake - I didn't get called for an interview at all.  I unfortunately  haven't received any feedback from J&J regarding the positions I had applied to.
I think they should directly interview the candidates such as myself with experience in addition to educational qualifications.Like me many of the candidates are therapeutically knowledgeable which can implied to the selling the specific product protifolio.
"I think there is an age discrimination bias is embedded within the company. My qualifications exceeded the job requirements, however no valid reason was given for not even providing me with an interview - and this, despite a highly successful track record within J&J, having been promoted several times and receiving multiple awards while a 15+ year veteran of J&J.   "
"I think the whole process was handled with complete professionalism and timeliness.  No recommendations!  I'll keep monitoring the career portal!

"I think the recruitment process is good.
I think it would be better to inform to candidates the reasons they were not approved."
"I think the process would be improved if the recruiter actually makes the call to inform of the decision not to proceed in the hiring process. I received the electronic notification, which for me, is the normal form of communication on these situations but, to be the best as I know JNJ (we) is, I think the process shall move to the better way of contacting the candidates by phone. This provides the opportunity of feedback and better understanding the rationale behind the ""not fit for the position"". That would become ""exceeding expectations"" in my rate process!   "
I think the process was fair. 
"I think the interviewing process can be improved.  I have been on internal interviews for two positions, six interviews in total.  All of the interviews were with multiple people and the majority of the questions were Credo/situational questions.  With multiple people the conversation topic constantly changed so there wasn't good back and forth dialog.  The general situational questions do not help understand ones experience and skill that is specific for the position.  So I reccomend removing the situational questions and go back to one-on-one interviews where questions and answers are specific to the position to be filled"
"I think the HR processes are not well coordinated. I got referred, contacted by 2 different HR managers afterwards, now I can't even log back into my account with the credentials J&J provided me with."
I think the hiring process should take less time. 
I think the applicant should be informed even if they aren't qualified for the position. 
"I think that you need to be more careful during the recruiting process. I think that the process need to be more personal. Maybe your are skipping a resource that fit and exceed the requirements or simply a person who what to be a J&J employee that can be a person with great experience and a great employee!!!!
Thanks!!!"
"I think that would be good if I receive the real reason of why I am not a good fit for the position. In that way, I can improve."
I think that the HR department needs to response to all applicants.
"I think that the communication between the talent aquisition team and the prospective employees is very poor. I have applied for multiple jobs and never get a phone call or even an e-mail stating that I was not a ""good fit"" or ""someone else was better qaulified"". The only time I know the job is filled is when I see someone actively training in the role I applied for. "
"I think that sometimes, a 10-15 minutes phone interview may help increase your chance of contacting excellent candidates that you may other wise missed using the resume only method. I know it may take an extra 10-15 minutes more but when you are looking for a possible long term relationship, it is worth it."
i think that me should of do a interview
"I think that is better talk with a person and explain directly my profile and expectative, i think that in internet lose a lot information about my self. 
I would like to be a part of the johnson & johnson's team.

Thanks

Eliana Pineda"
I think somebody with good qualifications y'all should reach out to the candidate
I think so far the process is very functional. But at least in the email when a candidate is not chosen to be pursued can state some reasons of what was lacked or preferred so as to help the candidate with what to improve so as to better chances with follow up opening's within the company.
I think one way that they could improve would be to let candidates know whether they are being considered for the opportunity or not in a more timely manner.
I think my survey answers provide the data necessary to improve your process.
I think more feedback would be good
I think more engaging as to why not selected. I felt like I was just a number it I know emails are sandrdized but maybe shifting the copy on the body of email with actual recruiters information versus VP 
"I think Johnson and Johnson seems like a wonderful company. I use many products, but have been told the only way in is by knowing someone which may be true. I actually have not heard anything since applying for any of the positions until this survey. "
"I think Johnson and Johnson is a superb company for the consumer because they provide quality products and life saving medicines to the public. I think they are a great employer to those lucky enough to join their ranks but I truly believe that they need to really expand on recruiting more diversity. As a mature experienced pharmaceutical specialty representative who knows he can make a significant contribution, I would like to be judged on my talent. Yet, we know affirmative actions have helped many minorities gain access to these valuable positions. Unfortunately, diversity is typically defined in terms of gender and race. Females and African Americans have benefitted quite well from these initiatives but ethnic minorities such as Hispanics don't seem to fare as well. We are not a racial group because we are several races but instead defined as ethnicity. Also, older workers are over looked or passed by when in fact they can make significant contributions to the work force, plus they are probably more eager to work than any other group but in most circumstance not given a chance."
"I think Johnson and Johnson is a great company based on my research.  However, the recruiting process is disheartening because you never get a response as to where you are in the process after the initial ""thanks for applying"".  For example, I keep getting these surveys to say how J&J is doing; however I would have like to receive an email saying how I am doing.  It is okay if the hiring manager was not interested or my resume did not pass the filtering process.  This information would allow me to better refine my resume and J&J to live up to their reputation of being one of the better companies to work for because they care about their employees/potential employees. It can be an automated process.  
Thanks. "
i think johnson & johnson should require a project work in regard thier requirement so that we can understand thier ability
"I think JnJ is a great organization and have applied for numerous positions over the past years unfortunately with no feedback on my qualifications or fit.  This wastes both the recruiters and the applicant time if not a good fit.   I tend not to apply anymore because I can spend an hour aligning my qualification to a job spec with no feedback as to why I was not even considered.  
Regards,
Rob Goldfarb"
"I think JnJ can do a lot more in terms of giving opportunities to those who are professionals, but do not have any experience in the Pharmaceuticals industry.  I have owned and operated my own business for over a decade.  I have worked as an IT Project Manager for a fortune 500 company and I can't even get a face to face interview with someone who is willing to take a chance on me.  Why not recruiting good people with fresh ideas instead of hiring from the same stream? I would welcome the opportunity to speak with anyone from the HR department or hiring manager.  Please let me know.

Thank you,

"I think J&J takes more time for the recruitment process, request you to consider the speed up recruitment process"
"I think J&J should  consider candidates that have at least an A.S. degree with outside medical sales experience and if that person has an excellent track record, Is a top producer and has very positive references from their previous sales managers. 

I have just 3 more classes to complete my B.S. degree and I know I was would be an awesome rep for you!

Thank you for asking the question.

"I think J&J needs to take a closer look at its applicants. You will find that I have applied for many positions for which I am qualified and I am summarily rejected. 
As part of the recruiting process I would consider the interest and determination of the applicant who wishes to be a part of your organization as well as the academic qualifications alone as factors in making your decision. Perhaps even an interview to at least get to know the applicant. "
"I think J&J is one of the most respected companies Globally.  

But, I must say I was disappointed in the lack personal response to my application.  I suspect a computer screening program did not find the key words it was looking for so no human ""wasted their time"" considering the value I could have brought to you.  "
"I think J&J is a great company. I was  referred by a colleague.
My comments are meant to be constructive not negative. The only reason I selected Strongly disagree in the questions above is because there was not an option that applied.

Unfortunately, I never got any kind of interaction...not even an interview...which is strange given my background.

I hope you find my feedback helpful. I think the company is missing the human connection in the interview process. I never talked with anyone...submitted my resume and now I get a questionnaire asking bout my interview process...which unfortunately never happened.

I think J&J is a great company and was really looking forward to meet the team.

Have a wonderful day!

I think J&J is a great company and I would love to work there.  Although I was not chosen to interview for a position I would still recommend the company.  
I think it's awful that you tell someone they don't qualify for a job but then continually send them emails to complete a survey about the experience. Maybe you should send the surveys just to the people who got the job or even the ones that had a chance to interview. Don't come looking to the people you rejected before you even gave them a chance to help improve your process
I think it's a good straightforward recruitment process
I think it would be very advantageous to explain to the applicants why they aren't a god fit.
"I think it would be interesting for J & J to talk to different people, with experiences in other market segments, because often an outside view brings great improvements and great results.
Risk is always present and must be taken in order to obtain differentiated results."
"I think it would be greatly beneficial if an actual recruiter looked over the qualifications of the applicants and provided real feedback instead or the generic computer generated response. I have applied to multiple positions at your Jacksonville, FL location, all of which I was either qualified for or highly qualified for, and I have never once received any communication back more than the general computer message. Before these experiences, I had an extremely high perception of J&J;however, due to these interactions and lack or responsiveness, the whole experience is quite saddening and depressing. I think the final information I had heard that was the worse of all, is that an employee I had trained while she worked at AMO was hired on as a Complaint Analyst level II, but I couldn't even get an initial call back for lower positions, and I'm one of two current Complaint Supervisors we have on our team. I would like to think that it is due to the acquisition that is occurring, or that you think I'm over qualified, but that doesn't make sense to me either, as in my mind and hiring experiences, in order to create the best and strongest team, I have always hired the best and strongest candidates, and it just doesn't seem you are making any real effort to live and development that kind of business culture. I really hope this information is taken with serious consideration, because I believe your current hiring practices are seriously lacking. My best regards to you and and the success of your business."
"I think it would be better if the recruitment process was divided based on what subsidiary within J&J the applicant was interested in, instead of the applicant submitting an application to J&J overall."
I think it would applicants should be given details on why they were not considered for the position applied for.  I was told if it was a matter of my skills or if I was out of the salary range.  This is the 2nd position I applied for and I've gotten no specific feedback in either instance. 
"I think it was pretty fair. They're very specific on what they're looking for. However, I wish there were more entry level jobs for millennials. Requiring 1-2 years experience could block really great talent."
"I think it is really difficult to start a recruitment process with Johnson & Johnson. I have applied several times in the past without success. The first time I establish any kind of communication is during this questionaire. I am a very well prepared and professional candidate who hope to be considered in the future to be part of your organization. I will continue applying until a real opportunity comes inside Johnson & Johnson. 
Thank you for your time to reading my comments.
Have a nice day,
Harry"
I think is good process
I think if you can provide a debriefing on why a strong candidate didn't get a chance to interview or list what was the candidate shortcoming in an email.
"I think highly of J&J as I did a short project there as an outside IT service vendor and I have family and friends who work there. I'll always think well of J&J.

However, the recruitment process was one of the least engaging I've been through. I'm surprised at that because I was an employee referral.

* I was offered this survey within a couple days of submitting my resume - which was pointless because I'd had no contact with anyone, all I'd done was submit resume and cover letter to the system

* I recall little to no communication about status - where I was in being reviewed or being considered.

* I don't recall having a screening interview

* The process was, in short, a black box - with no updates - until being notified I wasn't being considered for the role about 2 months after applying."
"I think as a current J&J employee, I deserve to be kept up on the process. I shouldn't have to track people down to find out that I didn't get the job. I feel that feedback would be nice. J&J claims to want their employees to go out and get experience in different sectors or positions but I'm offered zero feedback on why I wasn't considered for a position."
"I think all things should be considered not just college degrees.  Work experience seems to no longer count for anything here, no matter the time or effort that has been put in or the breadth of knowledge."
I think after running a company for years that I was more than qualified for the position. The fact that I not even granted a interview was really a turnoff. 
"I think adding a personal experience would be helpful. The correspondence was generic and very inpersonal.

"
I think a status report would be great.  I know J&J receive large quantities of resumes. But knowing if you're a good fit would help the process tremendously 
"I think a scorecard or quick feedback would be greatly helpful. I, as well as many other great candidates, would find great value in learning how we could improve our chances of landing our dream job with Johnson & Johnson!

I think a good one is to bring more opportunity for the interviews. Am not talking about me. It is just a general opinion
"I think a close look at candidates might give them & the company a better opportunity to move forward, i.e phone screening can be very beneficial."
"I talked to a HR person and filled out a lot of questionnaires etc, I believe.  I am really. It sure, j have applied for a lot of different jobs.  I did not receive e a call, just an email very late after filling out paperwork, maybe 3-4 weeks.  Good to hear something sooner, I did not have a face to face at all."
I surprised I even got this survey since there was no communication between me and a J&J recruiter.  I have more or less given up on trying to rejoin J&J through this avenue as I have had no communication or feedback other than rejections months after I apply for a position.
"I suggest when regret information is sent one needs to be a bit more specific.
Eg: for Senior position just a general frat message doesn't help. As the person has applied based on meeting the role & responsibility. By stating a para that other candidate was more suitable doesn't highlight ones shortcomings. "
"I suggest to be more open minded and give more interviews rather by just going with 10 years of experience on the paper. you might be amazed of the create force out there that are super passionate to create and market your brands. marketing is an art of creating and it requires an open mind but it seems like your company stick to one way of thinking only but regardless thank yoy for the automated rejection email and survey ! 

Love Universe!!! ;)"
"I suggest that Recruitment Associate Assigned should give a heads-up at least a day to the applicant if the position is cancelled.

Recruitment should also realized the applicants prepare and make time for the interview.

Have the effort and professinalism to call the applicant of any changes or cancellation of the interview. BE PROFESSIONAL!

Don't let the applicant call you (Recruiter) and you will tell that the interview is cancelled on the day itself. 

Respect the time too of your applicants,"
I suggest actually reaching out to candidates who meet qualifications regardless of submitting via the internet. 
"I suggest a better and open communication because there simply was none at all. The recruitment process should include the individual who is interested in the position. I was not selected and do not know why. I have seen the position open again and still haven't been considered. I even saw the position offering in a university.  
I was recommended to the position by an employee from J&J and the recruiter told that person I was called to interview,  but was not going to be selected.  I was never called for an interview.  "
"I submitted two different applications over the last six months and did not receive a non automated response, much less an interview, on either one.

No phone calls, no emails (checked junk etc), and am curious why you would even send me a survey."
"I submitted my resume/application for this role, but was not personally contacted by a recruiter for further screening.  Therefore, my responses will skew results.  Hope this is helpful.

Thank you,

Linda Schmids"
"I submitted my resume for this role months ago. This is the first response I am seeing. I still am not aware if my application has been reviewed and if I am being considered for the role. 

I think just responding to submissions in a timely fashion would be a great start! "
"I submitted my resume for more than 90 job opportunities at Johnson careers and I was not selected for none of all these 90 selection processes.
I really believe I had all skills and qualifications for all this vacancies, but I received no feedback about that.
I would like to work at Johnson, but I really do not know how I could participate on the select process since it is not working for me."
"I submitted my resume and never heard from a recruiter, the only contact I received was to take the survey. Would have liked to have received feedback as to why I was/was not selected. 

Thank you
"
"I submitted my online application, that was the extent of it all."
"I submitted my online application, that was the extent of it all."
I submitted my information on-line.  Never heard from anyone in recruitment at J&J.  Still interested in the position.
"I submitted and application and never heard anything.  I received a survey and responded via the link to Talent Acquisition that I'd received a survey but but that had been the extent of my interaction with J&J.  Why survey me when I'd had no experience at all?  The next day or so I received an electronically generated declination email.  I thought that was the end of that.  I was disappointed that I hadn't even been screen since I was a site leader in Tampa for Medco and thought my experience would at least lead to a phone screen.  But I understand that doesn't always happen.

And now I have received another survey asking about my experience for the same job.  Something is wrong with your system.

"I submit my application on line and 6 months later I received a generic rejection email. I guess this is due to high volumes of applications but it detears applicants from viewing other positions, as we are aware there will be a better candidate for available positions"
I strongly believes in J&J recruitment procedure
"I still have not received any notification on disposition of my candidacy for the job I applied for, yet get a survey about the recruiting process.  I might be able to give better feedback had I spoken to ANYBODY along the way.  Can anybody tell me where I stand with respect to my application for the position of COO, Center for Device Innovation TMC (6994170123)?"
I still have no idea why I was not selected for at least a phone screen or an interview for a position that was clearly a match for my skills and experience. I had a personal connection with the recruiter and was referred for the role. Also the timeline for response was far too long. 
I still believe in making a call to let the person know that they are not being considered.
"I started my recruitment process with J&J in August 2016 (with an employee recommendation and an in person interview), was left with no information and then contacted again in October to come in for another interview...it was not until late January 2017 that i was notified that I did not get the job.  Along the way i was given no feedback and never told any specifics on time line or when I would be notified.  I never received any feedback on my interviews or rationale as to why I was called back, but then not hired.  After so much time invested, it would have been helpful to learn what was lacking in my application or presentation.

I do understand that some jobs are just not the right fit, but this process went on for 6 months -- which was too long.  I felt as if I was being dragged along until they found a better candidate.  Regardless of the outcome, I enjoyed meeting the team, but would have felt better about the process and the company if they would have been transparent from the beginning regarding timing and procedure."
I sent in my application for the position in May. I did not receive any response until I finally received a rejection in January. It would be great if Johnson & Johnson could be a bit more responsive and timely with rejections as I am assuming that it did not take 7 months to evaluate my application.
"I sent in application and that was it. No recruiter calls or emails, telephone interviews, or anything. I believe I would have been a good candidate"
"I sent an email to the recruiter to have a discussion with her to follow up on my process - but she did not respond. I would have thought that it makes sense to form relationships with candidates just in case there are other roles that might come up in the future. 
Knowing how good the organization is, I am surprised this was not followed through. I am reachable at 323-377-9307 if you would like to have any further discussions. "
I sent a resume and got a polite no via email.  That's the extent of my experience.  Good luck
"i send out applications all the time...and not once did i get a personal response.  never got a phone interview or follow up.  i need a job badly and know that i can do many of these jobs that i applied for and those that i cannot, i am qualified enough to learn the balance that I am not familiar with."
I selected a linkedin apply and provided my information. A few weeks later I got an email that another candidate was deemed better. Not much to say about the process good or bad. I have no idea if an actual person reviewed my application or gave it any consideration or if an automated system just rejected my application after a set amount of time. I understand it varies - it took me 6 months to hear from HP and similar for Siemens so I know that it takes time to vet and select a candidate. I would not apply for a job I did not want or did not think I was capably of performing to a high degree so I assume the person selected is more of a fit than I appeared. What more is there to say?  Thanks for asking for my opinion.
"I see many positions that is suitable for my background and interests, however, I had never received any feedbacks on any of my applications. It seems a blackbox that I have no confident to submit any applications. Sorry for the negative inputs but the fact is that I don't see the system is connected to viable candidates, the least it is the case for me. "
"I searched my email and job application archives and couldn't find any follow-up communications after my initial application confirmation.  This is the first indication I had that I was no longer being considered (except for the amount of time that had passed, which is an indirect indication)."
I responded to the first survey but keep getting these every week. Please stop.
"I respect the fact that there are alot of Cv received by the recruiter but it will be a good idea to know why one is not selected most of the role I have applied for in Johnson n Johnson are roles I know I should be a right fit for but I couldnt get any feedback as to what I am doing wrong.

Feedback is key."
"I requested feedback, after my face to face interview, as to why I was not a good fit and any recommendations that I might improve upon.  I never received a call or email back, pertaining to this matter.  I would still love to hear some feedback, for future opportunities.  Thank you"
I rejected for the position almost immediately.  I know for a fact I'm over qualified for the position but that should not disqualify me as an applicant. I also believe my age was a factor in not being considered. 
"I refuse to apply to another position at J&J after being interviewed for the RWE analytics director position and being told that it was cancelled after 4 months of my interview date.  In addition, I was informed by my recruiter that being interviewed for the RWE analytics director position prevented me from being interviewed for any other position at J&J during this 4 month period.

The interview process was re-started at the beginning of the year."
I recommend engaging candidates in short phone interviews to learn about their career interests and translatable skills.  Thanks.      
"I recommend do not use an automatic software to disqualify a candidate. As an applicant, it is not fair to be disqualified because a specific written word is not in my CV.  I understand that you might receive hundreds of applications, but I think that it should be a fair way for this screening."
"I recognize there will be many applicants and it would be impossible for a recruiter to contact each person.  That said - the automated message could be a little more friendly although at least it did tell me I was deselected which is better than most organizations.  If you want to make it an 8 or 9 - less formal messaging inviting me to keep an eye on the job board, demonstrate a greater appreciation for expressing an interest and invite me to continue to watch for new opportunities.   "
"I recognize that you likely have a ton of great applicants trying to find a work home inJohnson & Johnson, and that can be overwhelming! However, the process was very long, very automated, overall cold and impersonal. I think that adding a little bit more of the human touch, such as a phone call to qualify and speak with potential candidates would help. Perhaps even moving to video interviewing would be a step in the right direction. We all know there is very little one can truly learn from simply reviewing someone's resume. Johnson & Johnson is a brand, not just a series of products. You are selling an experience and overall, loyalty. Yet your hiring process, unfortunately, does not reflect this at all. Instead of seeking the best qualified most trainable people with the right attitude, it seems like more of a resume writing competition and word race to the finish. The best thing you can do is bring the human factor back and sell the same experience to your would-be candidates that you expect them to portray to your large customer base. "
"I recognize that disappointment related to being passed over for the opportunity can cloud an assessment, but I think at minimum after interviewing with 8 different people for this one position, I should have received some type of formal response explaining the hiring decision.  I was truly excited about the possibility of working for Johnson & Johnson, and now my impression of the company is significantly different based on this experience.

My suggestion (because this is the third position this year I have been through extensive interviewing without any job offer) would be to give something - at least a few sentences - of solid feedback explaining the hiring decision.  It would be great to know if I was simply overqualified, or if I didn't have the specific experience of the candidate that was hired, or if an internal candidate was a better fit, etc.  After the amount of time I spent preparing for and attending the eight interviews, ten minutes of someone's time to share the decision points would be nice."
"I recognize that  J&J is a huge global corporation but it would be very beneficial for applicants to have an opportunity to speak with a recruiter or HR professional on any tips that can support them being advanced to the interviewing stage.   
thanks"
I recevied no contact regarding this position after completing the online application
"I recently sent an email stating how discouraging it can be to be asked to complete a survey without being offered an interview. I have received over five emails asking for surveys about the hiring process, but have not received one call for an interview. I would have be open to other positions within the company that I am appropriate for, but I have not had the opportunity to speak with a real person. I have only received generic forward emails regarding the hiring process. This is again discouraging and bordering harassment as I have asked to be unsubscribed from this mailing list. I will not be applying to Johnson and Johnson again and will discourage others from doing so based upon my experience. "
"I recently applied for staff mechanical engineering position in Irvine and though my engineering background matches exactly the description of the position, I have not heard from JnJ representatives! If this position has been canceled I would like to be notified.

"I recently applied for a position with  Johnson and Johnson, but was never offered a position nor was I contacted by a recruiter. Therefore, I have no knowledge about the inner workings of Johnson and Johnson nor the recruitment processes. Lastly, I cannot give an accurate score for the company's hiring dimensions. "
"I received zero contact, except that my resume was received, the day I submitted, until this survey request."
"I received two emails of the same position and not pursuing me as a candidate. I applied to two jobs at J&J. I did not get a call or an email about the other position I applied for yet.
"
I received this survey before knowing that I was not considered a good fit. It might be a good idea to get that notification first.
I received this follow up survey and NEVER received any contact from J&J. I assume I didn't get the job.
I received this email 1 month after the position was already filled. I did not receive any feedback on why I didn't get an interview or why I wasn't selected for the interview process from the recruiter 
"I received the survey before any contact about the posting was made. I'm not sure why you ask the first two questions in the survey for applicant that receive an email response to their posting. I wouldn't consider that email a ""recruiter contact""."
I received the questionnaire BEFORE I received  the rejection notification. You may want to address that. 
"I received no word for months about the job. Then I received an email that said you were not interested in me. That's fine but now you are bombarding me with requests for feedback. Seriously, maybe take more time with the candidate during the process instead of after rejection. "
I received no response.
I received no response.
I received no notification other than I applied and that I was not hired.  I even went through internal contacts to get to recruiter with no response.  I was also told as a displaced employee I should be able to see the recruiters name and contact information and this was not listed on the application process. 
I received no information or communication regarding the position applied and whether or not I was being considered or rejected. It would be most appreciative that efforts be made to provide some direct communication.  
I received no feedback whatsoever from the recruiter. I sent 3 or 4 separate emails to follow up. I finally go a terse reply indicating that the position was filled.
I received no feedback throughout the selection process.  
I received NO feedback from J&J.  The outside recruiter that made me aware of this position called me several times to see if had received any response from J&J.  I did not get a response regarding the job for over 6 months.  
"I received no feedback at all, and I'm requested to fill in a survey.
This is by far the most amateuristic process I have ever seen, and as this represents Johnson & Johnson's as a company, I can only imagine what kind of company this is and as such would not consider this company to work for.
As a customer of your products I will check for alternatives.

"I received no feedback after I applied on 03/11/17 for the position of COO, Center for Device Innovation TMC (6994170123).  Since the first question on this survey from 04/07/17 is ""did the recruiter contact you to tell you why you were not a good fit"" I assume this is my notification that I am not being considered for the role.  I would have liked to have received a call or an email in response to my application."
I received no feedback about my application.
"I received no contact or information as to this position after I applied.  Nothing, not an email, phone call or post card.  "
I received no contact from anyone about either of these positions. Very disappointed! Dave Webber
I received no communication then this survey. Not sure sending a survey when nothing proactive has been done by the company is going to vet positive feedback as a general rule- one expects no follow up from a company these days.. no communication no follow thru etc but if a company does not do that then asks about it .. exactly how is a candidate going to respond?
I received no communication at all regarding my application for this position.
"I received multiple emails about providing my feedback on the process before I had even been contacted about the job. It took about a month after I applied online until I received a generic rejection email. About a month after the first email, I received an email that I did not get selected for the job that I had been referred. Since I applied almost 2 months ago, I have received an email nearly twice a week asking for my feedback on my experience. The whole process seemed disconnected, unorganized, and unprofessional. "
"I received many, many emails requesting feedback on the process.  No updates on the status of my application were ever provided. But then again another email asking for feedback.  I gave you a ""5"" on the score because you are no better and no worse than most.

Good luck with your recruiting."
"I received many emails for this survey but none regarding the actual role. Understandable that the volume of submissions precludes that, but as a senior leader in the industry, I would hope that a personal touch could be extended, whether it is for a 10 minute introductory call or just to tell me I wasn't a fit."
I received ejecting notification only if my deselection 9 months after the process.
"I received e mails stating that I was not a candidate.  It would be helpful to learn a little more as to why.  My goal is to improve my skill set, my resume or whatever needs to be improved upon.  Similar to you asking me this question, it would be nice to learn so that I can improve."
"I received confirmation of my submission, but no other feedback or engagement. 

It would be nice to receive feedback to better understand where potential gaps (real or perceived) exist so that I can improve my positioning for future opportunities. "
I received an initial message that I was not a good fit but the hiring manager later interviewed me for the position. It seems like there was not a consensus between the recruiter and the hiring manager for the candidates applying for this position. Hopefully this was a unique experience. 
I received an email to inform me that someone else closely matched the position but I never received a call from a recruiter.
"I received an email stating that ""after my interview it was determined..."".  I never had an interview, nor did I ever have a recruiter contact me.  This survey reflects that.  I still hold the company in high regard, but it is not appropriate to send notification that my interview influenced the decision when one was not held."
I received an email stating my resume had been reviewed and that I would being considered as a potential candidate for the position. Not even two minute later I received an email stating I was no longer being viewed as a candidate for the same position. I just found the situation annoying and unorganized. I'm not sure what changed in those two minutes but it was disappointed. 
"I received an email saying that I was not chosen as a qualified candidate following my interview. However, I was never offered an interview. I was referred to the program by an employee and I casually spoke with the sales learning manager. He made it seem as though I had the qualities of a competitive candidate and that I should go ahead and apply for the position in the STR program June class 2017. I reached out to him about why I did not received an interview, and he said he would look into it but never got back to me. I feel as though there may have been a mistake or a misunderstanding with the application process that affected my chances of having a successful career in your company. I wanted to bring this to your attention. I wouldn't want something like this to happen to another qualified and passionate candidate, so that you do not lose the opportunity to gain valuable employees. Thank you so much for the opportunity, and thank you for your consideration on this matter.

After that I heard nothing back in a timely manner. Moreover approximately 2 or 3 months later I receive a rejection email and now approximately 6 months later an invite to take a survey.

THIS IS TYPICAL OF MY EXPERIENCE WITH J & J. ... WAS NOT SURPRISED.
UNPROFESSIONAL. 
THIS WAS THE ONLY ATTEMPT AT AN INTERACTION BY J & J."
I received an email from Johnson & Johnson stating there was no interest to pursue me as a candidate for the Executive Assistant position. It was very impersonal and it would be beneficial for companies to remember that people apply to jobs they are interested in and that they want to be a part of the company for which they applied. When responses are dry and offer no reason for not showing interest it discourages the person who spent the time to apply from wanting a future position with said company.  
I received an email asking me to apply. When I clicked on the link the next day the job posting was not there. It said the position had been taken down. So I was never able to apply. I have been trying to apply for a bit so I was really disappointed in this process. I am hoping to have another opportunity. 
I received an e-mail that told me that I did not get the job. I would have preferred to have a phone call to have a better understanding of why I did not get it. That's all I have to say to improve the recruitment process.
"I received an automatic email telling me that the position was cancel. So I never went to the process and this survey came through, a little strange. Need to fix your software application"
"I received an automated email confirming receipt of my application, however, did not receive any correspondence following such as an email advising the position was filled or even that my experience didn't match needs. 

I felt as though I was just left hanging....my resume went into the black hole. "
I received an automated email 3 months after the position was filled that I was not be considered.   You should improve timing.   I think HR needs to be careful not put gender in front of competence it was very clear management was pressured to hire a women to meet a quota.  
"I received an answer within a few hours that gave me no real information about reasons for refusal.
That doesn't feel like an acurate review of my application. 
Obviously I put a lot more effort in my application than You."
"I received an acknowledgement of application, but nothing since then.
Companies should contact those that are not considered a fit, or start the next step.  In this case neither happened.
I assume since I am receiving this survey, I won't be considered??"
I received absolutely no correspondence regarding the position until this survey.
"I received absolutely no communication regarding this job opportunity except the automated emails when I applied, and when I was not chosen to proceed in the interviewing process.  As a displaced employee, I had no expectation of hiring preference, but I was very disappointed in the lack of consideration and respect while pursuing this job."
"I received a survey PRIOR to receiving contact or a decline notification. I received a decline notification without a conversation or an interview.

I would wait to send the survey until after you "
"I received a standard, seemingly computer generated ""thanks but no thanks,"" then I receive this. This is a level of HR hubris that is increasingly an all-to-common cavalier attitude from HR. If I had actually been interviewed...then ok. It's not my job to help you do yours better."
"I received a return email that informed me that I was not being considered for a position. But over several months, I've applied to more than one position. The email I received did not tell me which position I was receiving it in reference to."
I received a response about 24hrs after applying.  Im quite surprise when I understand I met and mostly exceeded the requirements of the job posting
I received a rejection email immediately after I applied which means my resume was not reviewed at all
I received a rejection e-mail with no additional information even though my skills matched the job posting.   Providing information about my rejection would help me with my job search.   
"I received a quick reply that I wasn't going to be considered for this position. I thought it strange since I applied internally, already work for the company, and have been trained to fill this role - or one like it. This is not to say that I was the best candidate for the position of all the applicants, but to be ruled out so quickly was somewhat frustrating. Not sure what I'd change in recruitment process, but left me feeling less than thrilled about the whole process. "
"I received a phone call showing interest for the Senior Manufacturing position. I answered several questions and wrote back to the emails with all information that we being asked.

I have never heard back about this position and even left voicemails with no call backs."
"I received a notification that stating that due to changing business needs, the position of Senior Clinical Trial Leader (Senior Clinical Research Associate) (4760160211) at Mentor Worldwide LLC has been canceled.
"
"I received a notification that after my interview I was not selected. 
I NEVER HAD AN INTERVIEW.
I WAS NEVER CONTACTED BY A RECRUITER.
HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT"
I received a no thank you email within 24 hours of applying for the Head of Human Resources role. My background and skill set met the job spec requirements and it was very disappointing to have this experience with the recruitment team.
"I received a link to an application to fill a video interview. The application was a bit confusing even though I went through the training on how to use this tool, I couldn't see my self on the screen while recording and wasn't sure when it was starting to record my video, it felt a bit impersonal and I wasn't sure if I did a good job with it."
I received a letter notifying me that I was not qualified for a job I applied to almost a year ago. It would be nice if you would keep the applicant a little more up to date on the progress of their application status. 
"I received a form email that politely told me that you were not interested in me as a candidate.  I find it offensive that I'm then asked to comment on the process via repeated email requests.  
 If you deny someone via a computerized vetting process,  please don't further harass them by asking how they feel about the process.  If you ask me, which you are, your process leaves much to be desired.  "
"I received a cookie cutter rejection email quite awhile after I completed the online application.  I felt I was a very good fit for the position or I would not have filled out the application in the first place.

I am hopeful your candidate has been a successful match in your company.  If not, please reconsider my application.

"I received a call several days after I applied online and the recruiter was fine, courteous etc.  She was in charge of 3 roles that I wanted my candidacy forwarded to.  She did tell me the process would take a while which I am aware of however I learned after months had passed through an email that the role that I applied to was no longer being offered.  I forwarded this email to a former senior HR executive of J&J who use to work for your company and now with another firm since I was wondering if this was the norm.  I have worked as a senior exec at global financial institutions up until now and have never experienced this. "
"I received a call from a J&J employee as a favor to a friend of mine who works at J&J. I did not speak with a recruiter.

I receive the request for this survey everyday. I feel annoyed that the survey request keeps filling up my inbox. I only took the survey to say- please stop sending me emails for survey over and over again. it comes across as unprofessional.
I recall receiving that my application was received and being processed but not a result of consideration - That is I do not know if I am still being considered or not?
I really would like that they call me.
"I really think that due to the complexity of Ethicon, Cornelia - the recruitment should be focused on developing talent within the company rather than hiring people from outside companies to make decisions that take a year or two to be fully sufficient and able to contribute in a more meaningful way.

I have worked with several recruiters, and they have all been wonderful.  While they interacted very professionaly, I have witnessed that many people were already selected for posted jobs even prior to posting so the recruiters have little to do with the ultimate decision.

Feedback in my case has consisted of being ""overqualified"" which is a word I would discourage managers and supervisors from utilizing.  

Another major suggestion that has helped in my past career is to reduce turnaround - this reduces training time and extra demands on current employees.  In the end, it reduces quality and safety errors and allows opportunities for experienced employees with drive and desire to grow within the company.

I really wish that feedback included specific areas that I could work on to improve myself professionally so next time an opportunity opens I will have developed the skills that were lacking resulting in not being selected."
"I really never wanted to leave times were bad and my position got cut I could not relocate. 

I love J&J I tell everyone they are the best no matter what company under them you are honored to work for! I have been trying and Ted it is disappointing they will not give me another shot but I still think it is a great company but when I get a ton of new job openings and I am relocatabke now and I do. Of get even an email back I still remember my recruiter, Abby, she was awesome! But now it is just you post jobs I apply and never hear except to do a survey! 

I have been successful since i list my job with y'all so thank you I still won't give up one day coming back wheter it's here, or in another state, or country! You all have the best career path which is what I need and want!

Let us know to move on so we don't waste our times just like sales you would not want us in an office or hospital wasting our time ... we want to all make money and make the best decisions for our clients and patients especially so let us know why or what we can do give us something so we can move on to where we may be an asset although I am an asset and I was a great fit for y'all at Ethicon I even won the Sales Sim but I u derstand out economy but now I really would like to know why I can't get an interview or even a call or email ... i still and will always love J&J!"
"I really love everything about J&J. what you stand for, and have heard tons of great things about working there from former employees. I have been in the industry for over 7 years. I have been the top of every department I have worked for and been qualified for a great deal of positions that I have applied for at J&J.  Not once have I ever been allowed to even make it to the first part of the interview process.  Recently I have been told that the positions you post are not actual jobs and will be given to internal employees with no consideration of external candidates. this is frustrating for people who really want to part of a great organization."
"I really like Johnson & Johnson as a company however was shocked to receive this survey. I had never been contacted by Johnson & Johnson since I applied for the job until I received this survey.

With thay said I must say that the online application process was very user friendly."
"I really enjoyed hearing back from the recruitment process, regardless on whether or not I was moved forward in the application process. It takes great respect to send applicants updates on positions they are seeking. Many companies leave people in the rough to eventually just assume they were not chosen for the position. 

Johnson & Johnson got back to me in a timely manner regarding the position, and although I was not seen as a top candidate to go further in the process I appreciate the feedback! "
I really don't any thought on how to improve the recruiting process since I wasn't contacted by anyone. 
"I really do not being contacted by a recruiter for any of the positions I applied to at Johnson & Johnson.  Yes, it is a great company with a few locations that are very convenient to me and I would really like to work at one of them.  However, since I was never contacted by a recruiter after the resumes and applications were submitted along with a recommendation from a current employee, I think my chances are slim.  

As one who works on consumer engagement and customer satisfaction I applaud your survey to improve the experience.  However, you need to think about your sampling process."
"I really didn't get much feedback from the recruiter. I believe I was pre-screened and rejected by the automatic system.  I still like J&J, but it seems this isn't the right time to join I suppose."
I really believe that we should be promoting from within the company because it takes a year or two to be fully aware and able to make great educated decisions on the process.  I also think that we should strive to find long term employees to reduce time spent training and improve the time spent on action items that are important for business needs.  I really believe that reducing turnover will improve the company as a whole.
I really appreciate the J&J  recruitment process and will keep looking if any opportunity.  thanks!
I realize the large size of J&J makes it virtually impossible to reach out to every candidate. Thank you for seeking feedback 😊
I realize that you probably got hundreds of resumes for one specific job. But what would set johnson-johnson apart would be either an individualized letter instead of a form letter or a call from a recruiter. That would put your company on tier with the best
"I realize that there are numerous candidates that you must process through and unfortunately don't have the time to visit with each one of them.  However, it would be welcomed to have someone from the talent acquisition team talk with those candidates that have business experience that might fit into other areas of the organization.  The systems currently in place in most organizations don't allow for that human interaction and to provide one on one feedback.  Thanks for the opportunity and hopefully we will have an opportunity in the future."
I realize that J&J receives considerable interest in job postings. It would be very helpful to know what my profile is missing in order to better understand if I could be a candidate to work at J&J. At this point I am unclear on what I need to do to make myself a better candidate for future opportunities.  
"I realize it is impossible to respond to the number of resumes and applications you receive for open positions, but I do feel you all overlook some great candidates by basing majority of your decisions based off a piece of paper. I think at the least, a reasonable candidate deserves at least a 5 minute phone screening. I would have appreciated an opportunity to have a discussion about this position, but I hold no ill feelings and understand the process is a difficult position. I do however appreciate the opportunity to provide my feedback."
"I realize companies avoid giving constructive insight, mainly due to legal concerns and internal policies. But some form of feedback on how to improve candidacy would be great. "
I reached out twice directly to the recruiter for this job and NEVER received a response.  I also had a referral from a highly respected Senior Executive Assistant.  Very disappointed in the recruitment process at J&J.
"I put in for Tool & Die and never heard anything back from J&J I am still waiting
for a yes or no "
I pulled my name when it I learned this position wasn't a direct hire position. I don't want to work at one company and not be one of their employees. Especially working in Environmental Health and Safety. The other employees aren't going to listen as well to what you have to teach them. 
I probably wouldn't send a survey like this to someone you never contacted.  I never received any type of communication in relation the position I applied for (and it was over 6 months ago).
"I probably am not a good prospect for this survey in that I must not have been identified as a viable prospective candidate.  No worries, others did."
"I proactively requested feedback on why I was not considered for the position and did not receive any related to my interview performance. The recruiter stated they would contact me with this information once they received, and that did not occur.

I was requested a quick turnaround to coordinate a phone screen with the hiring manager and then a WebEx interview panel. Although I was able to make it happen, more time should be provided to the candidate especially for those currently employed. It is disappointing to apply a high level of effort for interviews and then not be afforded the opportunity. Plus, no substantive feedback provided on the ""why"".  It was a disappointing experience as a potential candidate."
"I previously worked for Johnson and Johnson from 1980 to 1991. It doesn't seem I was really recruited, I was lead. My guidance counselor at Gwynedd Mercy, Sr. Antoinette Zimmerman gave me the option to call the PhD father of a schoolmate to ask for a two week volunteer work experience at J&J so I could write a career investigation paper instead of taking my final exams. I did call and he  agreed, and after two weeks in his labs, and completion of the paper he offered me a summer work experience with pay. I worked a second summer after freshman year of college and was hired full time, and completed my undergraduate degree in night school at St. Joe's paid for by the company. In this case I was unaware of any recruitment process going on at all. I don't know who the recruiter is."
I presented the view in a different survey that I just took!
"I prefer a person to person phone call, It helps communicating information more effectively.  "
I posted for the position and received a rejection email a couple of hours later. It is obvious that some computer read my resume and sent me an automated rejection notice.  
"I possess nearly 20 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry. I have successfully launched over 15 new medications. I have been recognized as a National, Regional and District sales leader with multiple pharma organizations yet was unable to attain even a phone interview with J&J.

I would recommend J&J reevaluate its recruiting practices to attract and hire talent who have documented success in the industry. "
"I possess extensive pharmaceutical and biotech sales experience with documented achievements throughout my career.  My employment qualifications meet and exceed those posted for positions I apply to. I can not even elicit a phone interview from any J&J entity.

I have heard from industry insiders that J&J does not hire those over 40 for field sales positions. In Western states, there are numerous J&J managers that belong to the Mormon faith that will only hire those that are members of the LDS community.

It is apparent that age discrimination and religious bias permeates the J&J recruitment and hiring process."
I played lead role during consent decree at McNeil in 2015.when I applied for the same post as permenant employee status. I was not qualified. I find it funny that I was ranked highly when things were needed done ASAP BUT not qualified to test what i had help to start.

I only received standard auto responses.  I would love to join JnJ at any position so I can get my foot in the door with a great company
"I only received confirmation of the resume submiting , nothing else about the position."
I only received an email that the position was filled. There was no further action. 
"I only received an email that J&J would not pursue me as a candidate. Unfortunately, I am not aware of the reason.... Due to my resume or perhaps the job was filled. Therefore, it makes it tough for me to decide whether or not I should continue to apply to other positions."
"I only received an email stating my application was reviewed and I was not being considered as a candidate but no reason why. 
Please work with the hiring managers to agree on the searchable terms for vetting. 
My rating of the company is a rating on the company not the recruiting process. That rating would be very different."
I only received an email notification and not an interview so several of the questions did pertain to me.
I only received a generic email saying that I was not selected for an interview.
I only receive an e-mail fro J&J indicating I was not a match. I sadly can not answer many of the questions
"I only got a telephone interview for 5 minutes and I misunderstood what the interviewer was asking of me until after the call ended. She asked me to tell her about me, so I did, but after the very short call was over, I realized that she never asked about my skills or buying experience. I feel that I have the skills, abilities, knowledge and education for the position and I would have been a great fit for the company. I followed up with her in a message through Linkedin, but I just feel it was too little too late. I was told that there were others who were in the final stages of the hiring process which let me know that I would probably not get a call back. I really feel slighted, but this experience has no bearing on my feelings about JnJ. I know that you are a great company and I hope that one day I can bring my talents to your procurement department. I am available to discuss this further if you are interested at (904) 704-7097. If not, I understand. "

I never received notifications on how I was reviewed for the position. 
"I never received feedback. 
I am an internal candidate and I thought that would have occurred. "
"I never received feedback on this position until it had been filled (3 months after I applied - despite the fact that my credentials were completely on spec and I was extremely qualified. I actually know the person that got the position, so I know that either no one saw my resume or it was automatically rejected without any notification.

Over the past year, I have applied for 2-3 positions. Even when I did receive an interview, I was told immediately that J&J had the intention of hiring from within which made me feel like it was really a waste of time.  In one instance a very senior SVP told me she referred my resume to her HR partner who would give me a call to discuss opportunities in the group. I never heard from anyone. When I followed up, the SVP told me that she had requested that I be put into the Talent Community and that HR bring me in for an interview. Nothing. After 3 follow-ups, I gave up.  If J&J wants to hire from within, that's great...but don't waste other people's time going through the process if managers have no intentions of looking outside.  "
"I never received confirmation that I was not selected so this survey confuses me.  I can only assume an email will follow.  I received a confirmation that my application was received, received a confirmation that I was referred and then this email.  "
I never received any sort of feedback as to why I wasn't selected for the role.  This shows a lack of professionalism and common courtesy.
"I never received any information, I was never contacted nor informed regarding the process. It was very disappointing. "
"I never received any information regarding the role, despite being very interested and having a colleague at J&J refer me. "
I never received any feedback. 
I never received any feedback so I cannot tell anything at the moment.
"I never received any feedback regarding the process, till this survey request."
I never received any feedback on my application except an email to inform me that I have not been selected for the position four and a half months after I applied.
I never received any feedback from the recruiter or interviewers.  The closest thing was the rejection email I received 8 months after applying.   
"I never received any feedback from any positions I have ever applied for. I see this as typical for almost all companies, I take this lack of communication lightly in today's job search"
I never received ANY feedback for ANY position I have applied for. 
"I never received any feedback at all - and I applied for several roles in the last few months.
I sent a mail to highlight the fact that candidates receives a mail to provide a feedback on the recruitment process, but that there is no process actually (candidates simply fill in an application form).
I also tried to call few times, but gave up after I have been put through different direct numbers that never picked up.

I trust J&J as a great place to work, but I also believe that the efforts that candidates put in applying to roles within your organization should be compensated at least by an answer and a personalized feedback, to help them understanding in which area they should improve to be considered."
I never received any feedback as to why I was not chosen for a role that I had previously done successfully on a maternity leave.
I never received any feedback after applying for this position.  It was extremely disappointing considering that I have over 10 years of project management and New Product Introduciton experience.
I never received any feedback about the position except for to fill out this survey. 
"I never received any feedback - just a decline by email.

I have direct experience in this area, and a reference from a current J&J employee in this team, but did not receive a phone call."
I never received any correspondence whatsoever regarding my application. So reaching out to candidates who apply--whether it's via phone or email about why they aren't being chosen to interview would be nice. 
I never received any correspondence except for this survey - is this some strange new way to tell people they did not get accepted.  I am used to people hiding behind emails so they don't have to tell people bad news but you folks have hit a new low using a survey to say no.  I bet you won't even read or acknowledge these comments.  If so then call me at 214-240-2883 or email at glenn.triches@gmail.com.
I never received any contact. 
I never received any contact until after the new director was already hired.
"I never received any contact from a recruiter, not sure how this survey applies to me"
"I never received any contact from a recruiter, no notice of any progress in the recruitment process or email other that my application had been received.  
I suggest you make it easier for candidates to track the progress of an application and any interviews.  The hiring process must cost J&J a great deal as it seem to be a rather manual effort."
I never received any contact from a recruiter so this is either a poorly monitored system or just adding proverbial insult to injury for asking for my input as a reminder that I wasn't even being considered.
I never received any contact about the position until 3 months after application dying I wasn't being considered for the position.
I never received any contact about the position adtet I applied. Nor was I told the position was filled. 
I never received any communication.  Communication is the key and is professional courtesy of where you are in the employment process.
I never received any communication or status of my application. Only an email when the position was closed indicating that I was not being considered. 
"I never received any communication of any kind from anyone after I applied for a position. Perhaps I am being mistaken for someone else.

I never received an interview which makes it difficult to answer these questions.
I never received an interview for this position and I did not have any interaction with a recruiter.

I never received an interview

I never received a response that I was not considered for a role.
I never received a response from my internal application for this position.  
I never received a response and or update.
I never received a phone call so I wouldn't know. 
I never received a notification stating I was no longer a candidate for the position.  I received this questionnaire instead. Notification would bring closure to the process. 
I never received a invite or why I wasn't selected. 
I never received a follow-up but would have like to learn the details as to why I fell short in the process as to know where improvement can be made. The position was something I am well qualified to handle.
I never received a call.  I have a very poor impression of Johnson and Johnson. Not quite sure of the integrity of the company if this is your process.  
"I never received a call or feedback besides a decline.  I was a bit surprised, since I have strong domain knowledge and some history with clinical products.

I never receive any feed back except after 3-6 months later I get an e-mail saying that I am not selelcted for the role I applied. I applied to the job which is a correct fit for my qualifications. I do get interviews atleast in other big pharma companies but this one so far none. I have moved to NJ almost 10 years ago and not once I got a phone interview nor face to face. I believe I am not good for J&J and I will take my experience some where else. Because it is utter nonsense and waste of time.
I never interviewed.  I applied and an invite to take this survey was all that happened for me

I never interviewed for this position so do not know why I received this survey. I did apply but never did any of the process for an interview.
I never interacted with J&J on the position.  Just received an email stating other candidates were selected.
I never interacted with an actually person. 
I never heard one word from anyone after I applied. It was very rude and unprofessional.

I never heard from Johnson & Johnson about this position so I am surprised that I am being asked to provide feedback
I never heard from anyone. This is why my answers are not high ratings.

I never heard from anyone personally.  I only received an email say that JnJ was not interested in moving forward with me at that time.
I never heard from anyone in reference to my application- so it was disappointing process.
"I never heard from anyone in person (ie a phone call or a personal email back).  I believe I just got something that said I either was not the candidate they were looking for or that the position had been filled.  At any rate, I am a highly qualified candidate and would love to have an opportunity to let your team know what I do, and discuss how I could impact your business.

I never heard from anyone in any of the positions I applied for. I did receive a few of the automated rejections quite a long time after I applied for the position. Felt like I wound up in a black hole for anything I applied for. Not sure if a human ever actually reviewed my resume and experience?
I never heard from anyone at Johnson & Johnson not even an email saying that the position was already taken.
"I never heard from anyone at J&J, just received an email that I was not being considered for the position even though I am MORE THAN QUALIFIED.  All of these recruitment processes are a complete joke and a waste of time.  Unless you know someone at the company, it is highly unlikely that you will ever be considered.  "

I never heard back on several postings that I applied for.  This can be very frustrating and heartbreaking to the candidate.  This is the first I'm hearing about this position which really doesn't give a good feeling on jnj hiring practices.
I never heard back from the recruiter or hiring manager at all. I know I am qualified for this position and yet I was not given the opportunity to interview or provided a status in why I wasn't.
I never heard back from my application. 
"I never heard back from Johnson and Johnson. I have over 6 years outside sales rep experience building two different positions/companies from the ground up covering NC, SC, GA, TN, and VA. Sold over $300,000 in a territory that hadn't been serviced in over 6 years. I also have over 20 years retail, sales, management experience. I also have a loyal customer account base established. Your missing out on a very good rep for your company that has vast experience in the rep industry. The online process doesn't do some reps justice!"
I never heard back from j&j

"I never heard back from anyone about the position I applied for. I may just be a number to your recruiting staff but this process is extremely important for those of us looking for a job and hoping to be placed into a position that is a good fit with a great company. I think the least companies can do is provide applicants with the outcome (good or bad) and provide feedback, if possible. "
"I never heard back from any J&J recruiter, so if I was considered for a position I was never notified. It was several months between my application before I received a ""thank you but we are offering the job to someone else"" letter with no other contact other that my application was received."
I never heard back from a recruiter or got an email to say that I was not selected for an interview.

I never heard back
I never heard at all whether or not my application was even reviewed
I never heard anything from the organization until I received an email that the position was filled.   I doubt that my experience level did not match the position.   
I never heard anything from J and J after my sending in my application. Yet I have received at least 3 surveys on how J and J is doing. Your processes need improvement.
I never heard anything from anyone. I really didn't expect to hear anything. 
I never heard anything from any one after applying for this position.
I never heard anything except to take your surveys.
"I never heard anything back from your company until today, 136 days after I applied.  I can't even understand how you could send a survey to me after that long, but never contact me about the position at all.   I had heard that J&J was a great place to work, but if this is representative performance, I'd say I may have ""dodged a bullet"" here.  But this is one voice crying in the wilderness.  I'd love to hear from someone in your HR function telling me why  my experience is not representative of J&J's norm.  So, what can you do to improve the process?
• Respond to candidates.
• In a timely manner.
• Regardless of the decision about the candidate (to continue or decline them)"

I never heard anything about the application that was submitted. 
I never heard anything
I never heard anything

It seems valuable to obtain the attention of a recruiter, but one is at a complete loss for how to get in contact with one in the first place. The methods vary from company to company."
I never heard a word from recruiter so they were no help for me
"I never heard a word from anyone after applying for the position until I received this survey. Communication is always important even if the message isn't what you want to hear. I still think highly of your Company, however, I think J&J like most large companies needs to improve its recruitment process. People are the most valuable asset a company holds. Your HR should be top notch! "
I never heard a word from a Johnson & Johnson representative.  
I never heard a response after applying. I didn't realize I was rejected.
I never hear anything back from J&J and it is frustrating. 
"I never had the chance to interview for the position.  My qualifications were more than you required.

I never had the chance to get an interview  so until now I cannot say anything about it

I never had any contact other than automated responses. Including 3 requests to complete this survey. 
I never had any contact from J&J regarding my application. No rejection email or anything. I have NO idea of my standing
"I never had any communication what's so ever, with anybody from a recruiter or HR, other than I didn't meet the requirements. Although, I had most of the requirements,education, experience, skills and accomplishments for the job."
"I never had an interview, so I cannot provide valuable feedback.  I did, however, apply for the Chemist position."
"I never had an interview, only an automated response. Try using real people.Why don't you let this computer talk to the other computer. Maybe they can work it out and send you an automated response in about a year!!!!!!!!!!!!11"
I never had an interview phone or otherwise.  No one ever contacted me.  I applied for this position months ago.  My surprise is that I received this survey??????
"I never had an interview but talked to a recruiter a bit. Was never provided info or updates on jobs I applied to months ago. Overall, very poor. "
I never had a response to my application. 
I never got the email informing that i was not considered for the job. 
I never got notified I wasn't qualified for th position rather just a survery
I never got contacted by anyone  from JJ until I received this survey
I never got contacted by a recruiter.
i never got called for this job
"I never got called for an interview...so I could not answer some of the survey questions for this position.

I also (in general) would like to see some feedback on how competitive my application was...perhaps by percentage....Top 10%, Middle 50%, bottom 90%....I think this is directionally helpful information.

thanks!!"
I never got any follow up regarding my application but rather only follow ups on completing this survey.   I admire the thoroughness of launching this survey and the follow ups but would have appreciated a similar level of dilligence re my actual application even more.
"I never got any feedback on this role until I was asked to complete this survey.  So I'm assuming I wasn't selected to interview, but no one has told me that."
"I never got an interview, so I should not receive the email regarding this survey.
I have ignore the emails, but it keeps coming to me.
You need to correct the mailing system for surveys like this, limited to only those who get an interview.
Thanks"
"I never got an interview, so cannot comment on it."
"I never got an interview, so cannot comment on it"
"I never got an interview so most of these questions in the survey were irrelevant.

I never got a single feedback
"I never got a call, email, or letter and wish I could have gotten information if I was fit or unfit for the job. I really would have loved a job opportunity "
I never got a call so I don't know why I got this survey
"I never get any responses anytime from your recruiting team even the positions I applied are perfect fit to my background and education.

I was contacted and scheduled for an interview onetime.But no one called that day and no responses to any of my email communication later as courtesy.

Finally,in my opinion,your recruitment team's evaluation process is not appropriate and  becoz of that you will be loosing potential people,"
"I never even received an email telling me I was not considered for the job.  I am assuming by this survey that I did not get it.  I am such a great people-person, I am very smart, I am the hardest working person and I cannot get a job.  I am a doctor but I am not licensed but I have experience in sales, research, medicine in all specialties and I can talk to anyone about anything.  I am a great listener and I make friends so easily.  You are losing a great candidate by not choosing me.  People look at a short resume because no one wants my 16 page CV because it is too daunting for human resources people to look at.  How will anyone know what knowledge and experience I have?  I am so frustrated that I am probably the most qualified candidate but I am overlooked because I have not worked in pharma sales before.  I know what doctors want to hear, I know what they have time for, and I am the best at making a concise statement that is impactful. This job hunting process is exhausting and I am wasting so much time looking for a career."
I never even received a phone screen.
I never even heard from a recruiter but I had at least 5 emails asking me to take this survey and felt like I was harassed into taking it. So that completely soured the experience.
"I never even got a phone interview, so I don't​ understand why am I getting this email. "
I never applied to this 
I need a Job
"I must admit, I fully understand the testing section of the interview process. I'm not good with written tests. I would prefer to do the hands on before the written. Ultimately I feel seeing how one performs one equipment is superior to one's knowledge of topics that might not be used everyday. I thank you for the time. I just wish I cold have been evaluated different and scored better on the written."
"I might be not good candidate but after applying for exact match of job posted and also as of working in J&J, I didn't receive any respond back to my emails. I agree as I am not perfect match as of your perspective but at least I deserve some justification even in emails inside J&J. Thank you. "
I met the requirements by more than 150% and did not even receive a call!
"I met all the requirements for the position and wasn't even given a call, it took them too long to send me an automated email with 0 personal touch, which gives the candidate feel like his profile wasn't even looked at, obviously Johnson & Johnson company needs help in their recruiting department."
"I may have missed emails from recruiter, thus marked my response NA as well.
I have a lot of respect for Johnson and Johnson company, I would love to be part of it for a right opportunity.
"
I love for Johnson to get back to the applicant and at least give them a feedback. 
"i live next door to Johnson and Johnson factory. it is my dream to become an employee there, but u never call. ive applyied quite often, for they last five years. im willing to do anything and accept a entry level position."

What can Johnson & Johnson do to improve the recruitment process?
暂无建议
我没收到强生的 面试通知啊！！！
我参加了华东理工大学的那场宣讲会，提前半个多小时到场，现场爆满，队伍排出教室外面差不多30多米，根本进不去会场，HR收了我们的简历就让我们走了。虽然我没进入会场，不过在门外就感觉里面闷的不行。场地选的太小了，你们毕竟是名气比较大的公司，建议以后选个大点的教室，用户体验超级差！中英文简历各交了两份，还附上了求职信，不过音信全无，怀疑是否有人看过那么厚一叠的简历，直接扔了吧？
如有可能，请电话联系，又或者邮件注明yes or no
"Your way of recruitment is very good to the candidate IQ test, this type of surveys are giving good to know the candidate eligible levels of his work and experience, I am very happy say this it is a tremendous idea of recruitment.       "
Your standard rejection email for job application doesn't match with J&J MNC status organisation. Please review
your SOP is good.
Your recruitment process needs lots of improvements ....its not at all matching your brand name.
"Your recruitment process is the WORST!

The first time that I applied to Johnson & Johnson is under a ""Customer Experience"" post which I initially thought is a best fit for my experience (quality assurance). Then I was told that the position is for a ""Workforce"" job. The Job title and description is very misleading and made me withdraw my application.

The second time that I applied is for a Global Analyst position. After I submitted my online application, I got a survey email of the recruitment process. Two weeks have passed and I was advised by the person who referred me that I failed the application (interview). I WAS NEVER INTERVIEWED. 

I am a supervisor and have been conducting interviews too. I know how tough it is to manage deadlines but I always make sure that all of our applicants will receive my feedback regarding their APPLICATION. This will help them prepare and do better on their next application. AND YOUR RECRUITMENT DOESN'T HAVE THAT."
you take telephonic interview to get better candidate who perfectly suitable to your post.
You should tell me the recruit's result. ( I didn't hear anything about that.) And I really cannot understand why am I doing this things (even i failed your recruit. or not anyway i cannot hear anything your company's recruitment)
You should improve India recruitment
You should have at least inform applicants their application status.
"you should give chance to ever person who are highly qualified as i am , when ever  i am applying to job i here form the team that you are not applicable for the job, is it why so if am applicable than also you are not giving chance qualify."
"You should check the applicant's personnel and job abilities by Internet. Also, you do not rely only on machines, it is also important to evaluate applicants through paper documents."
"You shoul have the interview with the candidates.
"
you need to open also for fresh gradute.
"YOU MAY REVERT APPLICANT WITHIN A DAY OR TWO THAT CAN FASTER BOTH SIDE OCCURRENCE.
YOU CAN DESCRIBE MINIMUM EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION REQUIRE TO APPLY THAT CAN FILTER APPLICATION AND GET MOST SUITABLE PERSON.
 "
You don't even give me a chance to show my capabilities through interview! I thought this is an equal employer. Have a good Day!!
You did so good
You can try to leverage cognitive solution to give basic automatic response concerning some reason for evaluation 
you can take some personality test it can help you to get potential employee to beat your rivals.
You can show on scheduled phone interviews. It is very disappointing to be waiting in front of the phone.
"you can inform people if they have not been successful, I have applied for several jobs and all I get are these surveys, of course after 2 or 3 of them without even one line to say I have not been successful my opinion of J&J is rock bottom. It appears to me if you can send these surveys, you can inform candidates that they haven't been successful. Are you more interested in surveys than candidate satisfaction?"
You can call or send an email with an answer.
"You apply for a job & Boom. It is done, no update after the application, except for the survey asking for the feedback. Going through all the emails, leave alone recruiter sending out an email, not a single email was received for rejection even from the automated system. "
Yet to face recruitment process.
Yet now no one contacted for the recruitment offer. Try to make sure these activities as soon as possible.

"Would have been happy to receive reasons why i was not a good fit and further instructions on assessment test like the layout, what to be tested, how to prepare and practice, the whole process."
Would be great if the recruiter followed up with candidates' applications via phone or e-mail. 
Would appreciate if we can get a communication letting us know wether our application has been accepted or rejected. 
Would appreciate if recruiter or HR can contact candidate for intial phone interview rather than sending automated rejection letter (no due diligence).
Would appreciate if Johnson&Johnson could've provide a reason why I were not a good fit for the position I applied to.
Worst management in India to work with. Remove Ankita hr from immunology department . She is psycho 
With this survey I know now my application was dropped. The online process is good.  Thanks. 
Wish to contact me immediately.
Will be very happy to serve J&J. However we look forward to hear in detail reasons why company don't want to move further with application.  After having 10-15 yrs of experience in the industry  we expect proper feedback. 
Will appreciate a mail communication to notify that candidate is considered or rejected.
"Who Aspirants! Extremely like Johnson & Johnson.  Please give a job opportunity that type of persons. ...like me.. I love Johnson & Johnson 
It's a very good products Eco family friendly products.     
I advice so many friends and my relatives use of Johnson & Johnson. .

I want to work with you. .

Please give me a opportunity. ..

Johnson & Johnson it's a worlds favourite brand..."
Whenever you select the profile of candidate at that time j&j should contact to the candidate for telephonic interview.
"when you have find person in marketing job then you must be consider experience marketing person not only who has experience in  pharma sector at least  you juch the guy who really have potential to work with you . i am also non pharma guy i worked as regional manager in sips group indore  i am deeply interested to work in heath care industry marketing in my blood but i only regretted because i dont in pharma sector.
so please change your selection process if you agree.   "
"When you advise a candidate they are not successful, once will suffice, I eventually had to send an email asking that I stop getting emails to say I was not sucessful"
"when there's a fit to the initial requirements (academic reqts, years of exp), I think it is appropriate to inform the applicant why they aren't qualified still. "
When screening CVs for short listing for interviews it would be best to review without the bias of location. Or if there are people with more senior profile then a chance should be given to explain to the individual for the interest in a different geography or into a junior position. This would help in probably meeting the best fit / candidate for the role.
"When my friend refers me to JnJ that time I was very happy and eagerly waiting for the response of JnJ recruiters through mail or telephonically but still I am waiting......
This time only need to improve response time.

Thankyou"
"When I log back into the candidate profile to check on the submission results, the page I am taken to is the review & submit page and I would have to submit the application again. However, I had already received the email for my submission once before, therefore I was wondering if there might have been a problem or if we are meant to go that page when reviewing our profile."
"When I apply for a role, I go into some depth to understand more about the company and what the role involves. It is a bit disappointing when I get a rejection without understanding any reason why I have been rejected for an application. I don't understand why despite having the skills and qualification, I still get rejected."
"When candidates make the effort to go through the application process and fill out all required information etc, please make the effort to contact them personally if they are unsuccessful rather than a generic auto email.  "
"When a human being is investing her/his human effort for applying , s/he shouldn't only be subject to a mere system generated answer. "
When a candidate applies for a position and waiting for application processing period the recruitment office needs to contact the candidate within a month.
When   I will participate in process then I an comment on this . Write now this is not applicable to me.
"What? I've never received any call from HR since I submitted my application. Then, you want me to rate your recruitment process? Is this a joke? Will definitely share this negative experience to my 8k followers on twitter and 3k on facebook."
what made him/her not to be shortlisted?
"What do I say. 

I didn't even receive any email for formality. Regret to say.. very unprofessional and I felt too much of attitude. Some great person has created the Johnson & johnson brand. But employees act as if it was their creation. 

I was little confused, how recruiter justified I was unfit. Being an entrepreneurial person, I was not affected much and moved on because I know world is small and opportunities are wide. I sincerely and always believe unless until one meets and experienced, it is difficult to gauge the caliber, competency and attitude of a person/candidate. Sorry. But not a right process and humbleness and confident planning always wins.  Have a proper hiring and Wish you good luck. Best Regards. Lakshmi. "
"What could you do? That's a very long discussion to have. 

For now, please explain non- communications. Also explain why do u believe in in house hiring rather than giving opportunity to new faces. Third, if everyone needs an experienced employee, who is gonna train a new one?

Thank you"
"What are the parameter for not considering the profile.... So that it will help to improve.

"Went for an interview last year as well after meeting the hiring manager, then HR. However there was nothing, complete no news even after following up a few times with the HR manager."
Well:As I received the feedback from my friend and seniors it's a on of the best honoured organisation to work for...
"Well, i think there is no ploblem."
"Well it's awesome to have recruitment in such a way but whenever some one tries to join you then at least you should once inform that person why he is not selected. It's a dream for most of the youngsters to join J&J so once who tried to join, second time whenever any suitable post is there for them, should be notify them. "
We would appreciate your prompt reply.
We should be able to see the status of our application easily. 
We need more explanation about the  feedback of interview. 
We hope that we can speed up the reply to the applicant. Thank you!
"We got all information via mail only,I applied fr the post of DM vis mail n received mail that you are not right choice without ny reason"
we don't know where to apply for a job and where to submit our resume to join J&J
We are expecting the proper reason for not taking up the application
"We apply with a lot of enthu. But that dies when only automated mails are received in the inbox. I have not received a single mail so far from Johnson and Johnson, to why my resume wasn't shortlisted."
Waiting for opertunity to work with organization like J&J.
Video calling is latest communications thats j&j can use
very slow process for interviews
very poor in communicating to new employee.
Very interactive and should have skills of asking very wise questions....
"very Good process,best"
very good
Verbal communication with candidates and hr team in order to know the candidate better and what J & J will offer in return if an opportunity is given to the candidate 
"used to test the ability of psychological test job applicants, we will be able to see the ability of prospective job applicants"
Use the local language.
"update to all candidates, successful or not"
Update the status to applicant for recruitment process via email or call.
Update the prospective candidates about their status of application and actually consider online applications for the job postings on the website.
Up to now still no feedback on my application. Name is Justin Lorenz Domingo
Unfortunate to state that no one from J&J has written or spoken ....
"Understandably, there was a lit lot of applicants, however when a person shows the initative to follow up with a call more than twice & to be told you'd get a return call, actually returning a phone it is always the right thing to do. 
It shows a company professional attitude. 

As if I was part of the sales team at J & J I would always return a customers phone call. "
Understand the huge applicants who are applying for jobs but would appreciate to intimate the time required by recruitment team to shortlist...this will give a signal of whether candidature is under review.
Two things: 1/Timely communication 2/Clear outline of the recruitment process.
"Try to see that WE want to work .. and instead of seeing if we fit the complex profile that you made .. try to see how we could add value to J&J instead ? as most unemployed WANT to work .. its up to you to find a way to harness this energy for mutual win-win .. sincerely, Aroop_ehv@outlook.com , BSc PgDip MSc CPEng CEng ExMBA .."
Try to recommend other positions if initial position applied is being rejected.
"Try to reach candidates who have online ,and not proceeded further rounds."
"Try to provide feedback in a timely fashion
Avoid leaving extremely negative experience such as not giving any updates till 6 months later, and only sent an system-generated email after 6 months. It makes candidates feel not appreciated for the time they spent."
Try to give opportunity to fresher.
Try to contact candidate by phone via phone interview to know the candidate better than only communicate by mail.
Try to contact applicants in good time.
"Try reaching out to all candidates, shortlisted or not shortlisted and at least inform them on the status of the application."
Try looking at the actual CV by a person and not through search software.  You will be missing out on some great talent by using a software to review the CV.
Try and get a bit personal and actually contact the candidate that has spent time and effort filling out the gruelling applications. Thanks 
Treat prospective employees with more dignity.
Transparency and prompt response.
Transparency and consistency on the recruitment evaluation and feedback 
Transparency
"Total recruitment process need to be reviewed. Previous Job I applied, I got more experience than advertised position and my application was rejected without any Valid reason. 
I don't think Johnson and Johnson Talent Acquisition has a good recruitment process.

"To Whom It May Concern, 
                                          I have never seen such discrimination in my life before. I am an avid user of your products since infancy. I have a strong background in business development in Japan and have worked for such companies as Apple, Meisekimu, AGM and have created large investments and products within Japan. Having been keen to work for your company and help expand brand awareness and marketing strategies after seeing the ad, I thought I can bring my expertise and skills to help J&J further expand in Japan by bridging the gap also having a western person with Japanese business development skills and experience.

Yet your companies lack of professionalism to grant me that chance, yet alone an interview, shows the people behind the chain of command lacks the dignity and respect your company has been and should be known for. Yet hiring someone else which most likely has zero experience and barely speaks a word of English or has the strong business acumen needed for this particular role. Perhaps you should wake up, as even online there has been a lot of negativity geared towards your company regarding condescending treatments and discrimination on all basis.

When you decide to show respect by all means show it, or should the Japanese media get to learn your true colors? 

When you decide to respect people and show some dignity and respect by all means do contact me again raymondgeorgejp@gmail.com

Thanks for nothing!

Till now the recruitment process is very good. No improvements nees now in my view.
"Till now nobody contact me so I am unable to say any thing on the above subject, apart from it I liked the feedback process of your's. "
Till date no one contact me
thx.
Through direct recruitment instead of third party pay roll.
"through  written examination, Interview and the test of spoken English and  Personality.   "
Though I have not been asked for recruitment process so i can not comments on that.
This survey implies that my application was not successful. I have not even been told that let alone been given a reason (as per the first question). I do not believe that it is right that candidates spend a lot of time preparing applications and then there is no response. I did receive confirmation that my application was received but nothing more. I think a detailed email or telephone call explaining why the application was rejected should be standard practice. I have heard from other companies that the reason that does not occur is because there are often some hundreds of applications. Each one of those people has put effort into preparing their application. It is basic respect to respond in kind. Another alternative would be to write the criteria in a much more detailed way such that less people apply in general and so the company receives less applications which are all much more finely tuned to requirements of the role. 
"This process is very good. Nothing to improve. 

I want to join with Johnson & Johnson.

Please help me to join .


Thanks & Regards

This mail came to me before I heard back from J&J. I'm not sure whether to treat my attempt as unsuccessful
This is transparent process and I felt J&J is doing great job in recruitment Process.
"Think before you reply to the candidate - please take a few minutes to reply. It takes about 20-30 minutes to fill up the application online. Respect that.

The response almost makes me feel that I am interacting with a robot who has no idea either about the job or my skill set"
They took my call when I rang to enquire about the application (rare) and I received an email advising I was not sucessful also rare so appreciate that. Just sorry I didnt qualify for  an interview as I had heard good reports on your company. ☺
"They should want to reply to all who are selected and rejected. Who are rejected give reason of rejecting application
"
"They should reply back as fast as possible, what will be the qualification requested for that job mention separately 
"
"They should offer expwerience Candidates Diffrent Domain also.. It makes lot of difference in approaches & generate new ideas.. they should restrict percentage of academic Results.. They should train people like me ,who is having diversified field s knowledge .It gives more results on future Market setup..."
"They should get me LOL seriously I am very good.  

Aside from that, no complaints. "
they should every candidates regarding their application whether they are selected on not. 
They should contact us directly and give the status of recruitment process..
They should contact personaly to all applicable candidate
They should call candidates who are applying to vacant position and if they are not suitable for the position then they should at least informed those candidates.
They should call candidates that is potential and interview them people won't apply if they do not feel that they can do the job
"They should be in contact with candidate.

Maintain follow up's"
They should at least reply the candidate whether his CV has been shortlisted or no
"They should at least call to candidate  before rejection 
I  have applied for ZSM position but did not received any call"
THEY SHOULD ASK THE EMPLOYEE WHY HE OR SHE HAS NOT BEEN CONTACTED.THEY SHOUD TELL US WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA REQUIRED TO QUALIFY JOHNSON AND JOHNSON
They must contact the perso applying for the position . Should have a telephonic interview and then decide if the person is qualified or not .
They have not called me for interview. At least they can call.
They did not contacted me at all
They could provide the candidate feedback on why the application was not proceeded with. 
They could have offered me a job
They could actually call the unsuccessful applicant and explain why they were not chosen for the role rather just wait for the applicant to enquire if there has been any decision. When you dedicate 12 hours of your time to pursue a role only to be sent a generic email informing you that you were unsuccessful is quite unprofessional and I expected more from jnj. Not good enough!
They can at least reply to the applicant if they are not selected through. I have applied to a couple of fortune 500 companies who have replied to my application even it was a NO! How about a little professionalism towards applicant!
"There was no, and I mean absolutely no, communication from the recruiter regarding my application after initial interview.  I was verbally informed I was a highly regarded candidate due to experience and I would be recommended for second round interview.  From this point there was no communication from J&J, excluding my email queries for information.  Here is a C&P of my last communicate FYI;

Hello Daniel,

Hi Nikkie,

I hope you are well.  As the festive season is upon us and most industry moves into a shut down period for the Christmas and New year break I just wanted to make a quick query of any updates or information you may have in the recruitment process for the hip product manager position at de Puy in Australia.

I would assume the process will move into interview stage early in the new year, I wanted to be sure to be available as I will be heading coastal for just over a week with family

Wishing you a safe and happy festive season

Hello David,

Good Day!

I have not had the pleasure of meeting you but allow me to introduce myself. My name is Nikkie Ramos from the Regional Sourcing Team of Johnson & Johnson. I’ve received your application for the Product Manager role and would like to have a quick chat with you about this, could you kindly me advise of your availability.

Thanks,

"
"There was no feedback at all. For an international company, I expect some feedback to my application online. As compared to other multinational companies here in the Philippines, J&J did not give me any update regarding my application. A decent standard pre-formatted email would suffice just so applicants are not left in the dark. "
"There was no contact regarding interview process, or feedback as a result of my employment application, it appears I was not successful in proceeding to interview, however some feedback relating to my application would have been professional on the part of J&J.

The only communication I have received is the request to complete this survey, a very disappointing outcome."
"There was no contact no meetings just a review of my resume and an automated response.  I have actually applied for two different positions and this has happened twice.  I now rarely even go on to the careers section as it is a bit deflating.  I actually really like the products but this recruitment part of the company leaves a lot to be desired.
"
There should be telephonic conversations and fast communication. 
"There should be more transparency on recruitment process 
And Need to provide finer points email etcwith improvement area or the feedback to do better or need based training needed to further develop skills needed."
There should be auto filter for job criteria where one can apply and see that he is eligible or not.
There must be a deadline or a designated reply date mentioned on the job postings for the candidates to manage their schedule and preparation.
There is not contact from recruiter . It has to be changed 
There is no update either I am selected or rejected.
"There is no transparency in hiring the excutives ,no information has been provided that why they havent called the person for interview .there should be an online hiring system jnwhich informationof each candidate should be entered and marks and reasons should be given while taking the interview of the person"
"There is no suggestion in my view, it is very hard to give suggestion for such a perfect process."
There is no response for a long time.
"There is no clarity on the recruitment process.there is no selection  on basis of merit,it total an personalised selection where candidate are pre-decided by higher management before the job vacancy is out.even after applying they even don't take interview as well as an casual feedback is shared after interview.strong dishearting to experience all this in a company like Johnson&johnson.external candidate are given job,with much more higher package.really its heart breaking.think of leaving j&j as there is no carrier in this company."
"There is a need for being transparent on why actually I am not a good fit. Also, if you have preferred an internal candidate, don't bother to advertise it for the mass market. Thank you."
"There has been no contact since the application. As a start, having a process to reach out to your candidates and update the status would be good. If there's a line to say that only shortlisted candidates would be contacted, should be removed. 

All candidates should be contacted, shortlisted or not, they will appreciate the professionalism of a company who is looking to recruit professional workers. "
There has  been absolutely no one who has taken initiatives from JOhnson & Johnson's end to get in touch with me.The entire point of applying is obsolete. Highly dissapointed.
There can be improvement done with respect to getting back to candidate regarding acceptance or rejection of the application.
"There are several IT issues in the portal. 
The forgot password section does not work and there is no way feedback can be given"
"The whole process was not up to a standard to call yourself a MNC and one with a proper process. No follow up, no formal response post the interview. No correspondence until my own follow up. Even a follow up email to HR post the interview was not responded to. It is very embarrassing for the candidate. Interview was also conducted in an office room rather than a proper meeting room. Lots to improve on although I doubt these surveys see any light of day. "
The system to apply for the position and check updated status is too complicated. 
"The selection of employees should not depend on division bases, recruiter may give opportunity to all eligible candidates for vacancy,
Some how internal recruitment may expand many of employees from mass market want a exposure in specialty or medical devices division however it's not offered to them."
The response should be quick and with proper reasoning that why a person is Suitable/ Not Suitable for the position applied.
"The recruitment team should share correct reason for rejecting candidates.
I would like to quote one example. I was interviewed in December 2014 for the position of Manager in analytical development. My all interview rounds went good (as per my knowledge). I waited for almost 2 months for the response from recruitment team and finally I called one person with whom I was dealing. He told me that ""your candidature doesn't fit with respect to the total experience for the position"".
My questing is that, My CV was already with recruitment team and based on that they called me for face to face interview after two telephonic rounds. At site I was interviewed for three times and finally recruitment team says that ""your experience doesn't suit for the position which we are looking for"" is really not good for any candidate. 

I really would like to thanks for global team to give me a chance to share my incidence with you. I am still looking for great opportunities in Johnson and Johnson as this is my dream organization.

Thanks a lot
Regards
Sachin Shelke"
The recruitment team should not base only on the applicant's score on the recruitment process may be they can also consider other factors and maybe they can invite the applicant on a interview if he/she scored a bit low compare to the ceiling grade. I believe that one's abilities and capabilities cannot defined alone by an examination. Thank You and more power :)
"The recruitment team should keep in touch with the people who applied already, like sending mail to the person about the future job opening process."
The recruitment should happena a bit at faster pace.
"The recruitment should contacted the applicant if they pass or not, give them the status of their application not just merely getting the resume of the applicant and updating the files and their record online for database purposes. "
"The recruitment should at least inform the applicant into on coming contract or temporary position. Mainly, people will to take an effort for good opportunity into world class organisation such as Johnson and Johnson. Mainly, I believe johnson has good credo for all his current and future employement."
"The recruitment process you have  are right now which basically uses digital technology may be the most efficient and cost effective way to recruit potential candidate for a certain position.
The response time is fast enough, but the system has no way to check the the authenticity of information given by the applicant. I wish the internet could have a way to validate the data gathered to an individual applicant if the information given is authentic or not before going into actual interview and eventually acceptance.
One method may be embedding some questions in the data gathering to validate the sincerity and integrity of the applicants."
"The recruitment process was good.  Kris Bodson and Eliza Foo from Tax ASPAC were sincere, professional and personable.  Vicky Hsiao, Country Recruiter from Talent Acquisition was very patient and warm when sharing J&J's corporate culture and offer details.  Cheryl-Ann from Robert Walters was professional and helpful.

It was a really tough decision to decline the offer because the Singapore tax manager opportunity was a good role and I was very impressed with J&J.  Regrettably, after much deliberation, at that point in time, I decided to stay put in my existing company.  Nevertheless, I will be keen if opportunities in J&J arise again."
The recruitment process should be based on market experience in that particular field and not on other requisites as for example that MNC candidates should only be considered. There should not be any recommendations from external sources during the interview process.
The recruitment process needs a more personal touch. I understand that there are 1000+ applicants for every position however in todays market a personal touch is needed to stay attractive as a company. 
the recruitment process must more faster.
The recruitment process is very good.
"The recruitment process is very good, and the details can be improved."
"The recruitment process is one of the worst in JNJ, you keep on applying without any feedback, they come on campus present the opening you apply and then everything silent, it took JNJ 8 months to send me a rejection for a position. 

This is really bad, and is not appreciated."
"The recruitment process is nice. Just the candidates are too many and the positions for accounting and finance are relatively few. I hope I can have the opportunity to join Johnson & Johnson in the future, when I graduate in June. Thanks!"
The recruitment process is great. Hopefully there is a job for me as a Registered Nurse. Thank You.
The recruitment process is great. Hopefully there is a job for me as a Registered Nurse. Thank You.
The recruitment process at Johnson & Johnson was a positive experience even though I did not get the position at Ethicon. I appreciated how nice was the interviewer and the feedback I received from the HR Team 2 weeks later.
"The recruiter spend time to explain which is very good compare to other listed company which I do appreciated.

Ubderstand the number of applications is huge and it will be great if I can have interview oppopunities equally. "
The recruiter should give a feedback to the candidate after interview.
"The recruiter should contact applicants to let them know that they have been rejected. I feel that it is a courtesy for companies to inform applicants, considering the fact that applicants usually take hours to customise their cover letter and resume for the job, on top of having to complete multiple online tests."
The recruiter should carefully examine the qualifications of an applicant. The resume speaks for itself but other employment factors which cannot be seen in that document should be observed and considered during the preliminary interview. Probably the recruiter was skeptical because I was a working student; what he/she failed to factor was the fact that my background works to the advantage of the position I am applying for. 
"The recruiter needs to be able to identify quality candidates that are able to solve their problem and provide solution to the company; not base on a quick look at resume/CV. There must be a minimal viable requirement, but there should be more interactive with the candidate or come up with a method that will be able to identify key candidates. For example, a quick survey about solving problem in a work environment or test on candidates' soft skills."
the recruiter must call or inform me why I was not fit for suitable profile.
The recruiter did not contact me anything.
"The recruiter did contact me.
But they didn't justify my rejection.
I'm sure everyone keeps asking for this yet still I will add my voice to and demand a comprehensive justification for the rejection. Added to that a step by step follow up with results during the interviewing/ assessment process."
"the recruiter contacted me but well after the process, could have been more timely contact..."
the recruiter can contact the person interested to join J&J and give clarification whether he/she profile fits in to their expectations.
The process should be more expedite 
"The process seems to b lengthy and candidate does not know the outcome of it.  I supposed this is a common response for unsuccessful candidate as only shortlisted candidate will be informed.  Nonetheless, it is good if unsuccessful candidate can be informed of the outcome as soon as Johnson & Johnson shortlisted other candidates."
the process of recruitment through an unusual way
"the process is a little bit slow, and it is better to give the applicants the reason why he/she does not fit the position, not just inform that you failed. "
The person applying for any position should be atleast once contact and talked to so that the employee is clear about what's wrong and why he or she was not a fit. Sometimes may be via phone you can make out better than just reading the resume.
"The only thing is to let the candidate/s know asap as to the outcome of their application.  I understand if the team has not made a decision etc and if managers are away etc...but along the whole chain of steps there could be a more cohesive company policy to streamline these steps.  

However, as an individual Virginia was very professional and courteous.  Well done Virginia!  Although I was not successful this time she communicated this well and that I should keep positive for next time.  This does count especially on the receiving end.  Everything happens for a reason!
- Thanks J&J.  Better luck next time for me.

Regards,
Maria Alexakis.
"
The one who are registered should be known whether they are selected or not in the post they have applied for and also if there is some openings then they should get notifications regarding the post to only who are registered.
"The on campus info session was poorly preformed and as a current MBA student, we might have a better chance to conduct a better presentation that the recruiting team."
The number of tests was overwhelming and they required a lot of time to complete. 
The mails for new job openings arrive without looking at my profile. So most of the time I am receiving mails for job opening which are not relevant to me. 
The link to the legal summary of applying did not work.  The website is relatively detailed l.
The least they could have done was to provide me with an explanation as to why I was not selected for the position.
The least they could do is to explain why I'm not a good fit. 
"The job applicant should me informed about the job status since the applicant keeps waiting optimistically for the revert from the company.
"
The is system is already fair. But as you know improvement required at every stage. 
"The interview process was not match to my schedule... So I couldn't do the video interview. Hence, I can't give you profer data you need. 
However, I can say that your recruitment process is well-organised and prepared. I did not wait a long time for a result of a selection progress. A recruiter nicely done her jobs. She kindly provided information applicants need by email."
The first communication from J&J is this survey apart the thank for applying mail. Do I need to say more.
The first and 2nd round interview was good. But no body contacted me or informed me about the result and neither I have been informed about the reason for non selection of my application. When I send mails twice then only they told that Im not selected. I didn't got any reason. I know and I am confident that I am a perfect candidate for this position. Anybody can take my interview again. The vacancy is for Institution business and I have been working for Cipla Ltd since last 8+ years in Institutions only. I got several times applause from company. 
the feedback is very slow.
"The experience could have been better if the following things were done
  a) if the reason for unsuitability of the candidate is informed
  b) A timeline by which a reply can be expected is mentioned to the candidate  "
The email that I have received from the company did not explain fully why I am not qualified in this position. 
"The decline letter sent to the applicant was vague and did not give a sufficient enough reason as to why the applicant was denied. See example below:

""We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Breakthrough Opportunities for Leadership Talent (BOLT) 2017 - Management Trainee (Sales, Marketing & Supply Chain tracks) (000017F2) at Johnson & Johnson (Philippines) Inc.""

Giving a more concrete reason (such as grades, skills, or values not matching that of the company) would have a more positive outcome, even though the applicant is being rejected."
The company will improve its recruitment process in a way that it will response immediately or as soon as possible to the application.
The company should inform the applicant right away tegarding his application. Thank you.
"The Company may think to open a recruitment center in Kolkata, India to enable the talented candidates to be imparted with the activities of the company."
THE COMPANY FIX ONLINE EXAM TO PASS THE RECRUITMENT...
"The career page had issues when I was trying to submit my application. Halfway through, there was a server error. "
The candidate shall be subjected to entire recruitment process
The candidate shall be subjected to entire recruitment process
The candidate shall be subjected to entire recruitment process
"The candidate might not present well using the web application.  If giving the reasons to the candidate like a conversation that might be good for both parties to understand if the job is suitable or the candidate is good fit for that position.  

Thanks! "
"the best way is to be given the feedback about the application status, regardless whether you have be selected or not.so that you can move on.

that's all I can say at the moment."
The are fairly good in its process.
The application should be rejected with a reason which doesn't happen in my case.
"The advertisement should spread all across.And the candidate should be given a chance to give interview
"
That is good process. It's not to improve. I also like it.
"Thanks for reaching out to get a feedback. Unfortunately I have not marked it favourably. I applied for the position because I believed that I had the experience and qualifications that are suitable for this role. I understand that the hiring team may have not agreed. However, I expected that as basic courtesy, I should have at least got a chance to speak to the recruiter and present my case. It's not the outcome that disappoints me, instead it's the process. All I ask for is that those applying for a role should not be treated as a piece of resume, but as humans. Thanks again for giving me an opportunity to provide a feedback."
"thank you J&J for this opportunity, I appreciate you! hope to hear from you!"

Telephonic interview
Telephonic communication to assess the candidate instead of sending not progressing further emails without any reason to justify
"Talking to applicants will get you amazing results. More often than not, the CV will not paint the correct picture and talking to the candidate explaining what you are expecting, to see what the candidate can bring to the table, how big is the gap and if there are opportunities to bridge it will make all the difference.

Agreed, you will be receiving a ton of resumes and its not possible to talk to each of them. At least at senior levels, this may be a good practice to start. 
Also, you should be able to sniff genuine candidates to talk to, from the CV itself. "
Talk to your candidates. even if it is only to let them know that they are not suitable.
Talent shortlisting instead of profile shortlisting.
Talent Pool
Taking this survey is too late for me. It should be done immediately after the notice.
Takes seriously to the recruiters
"Take on line test for best selection for everybody.
Rgds,
Ajay metkar."
Take d interview on time and send proper feedback to d candidate
Surveying about experiences of each candidate and give chances to them as a first phase of interviews 
Suggestions of alternative positions that better match the skill sets would be helpful.
"Suggestion is that if Johnson and Johnson want to push the boundaries on all positive means , and would want people with different experiences and preservative views.  

Johnson and Johnson should look for that type. Rather than getting the people from the same industry with sames experience. That spell very little evolution for the company. "
Suggest  Recruiter should call 
streamline the recruitment process please
Stop keyword based selection
still more tests on journel knowledge
Still I'm not receive any calls from. Johnson & Johnson. I suggest  J&J have to call all the candidate and then after finalize the shortlist process.
Still i didn't  got a call
State why the candidate wasn't a good fit for the job.
Starting responding. You asked me to apply and nobody every got back to either rejection or interview - For almost 8 months!

However, we understand that it is done according to the recruitment procedures. 
Just hope that, one day, the recruitment process looks not only on the resume, but also more considerations are taken in the preliminary screening. "
Some feedback on how to improve job opportunities with JnJ
"So many Employes Are Working For Johnson & JohnsonThrough The Thirdparty,Is There Any Vacancies In Direct Payrole Based on Candidate Eligibility Who is Working in Thirdparty  For Johnson And Johnson Please Adopt Them"
"So far, I think J&J's recruitment process is one of the best among all these MNCs. However, it is still late to get a response. I'm fully understanding it could be a challenge for such a big company, but it is a totally different story for applicants. Delayed rejection would cause negative feelings on the company. 

"
So far the recruitment team has not yet called nor confirmed anything about my application. I have no idea if I have a chance to get the position I applied to or not.
"Sir
   I am Dibin Denny. I am more interested in join your company. I am applying more jobs in your company, but no calls from your hr team. If any vacancy for any post please consider me sir.

J&J is a reputed and a favored company, hence the interests to associate. However if I were to evaluate the company on the basis of my experience with the TA team, the ratings would be much lower.    "

J&J is a US based MNC and has a stellar reputation in the marketplace but your Singapore based HR appears to be as conservative and closed minded as the local firms i.e. candidate must meet the job description exactly or there is no chance.  What it really displays is that  your HR has very little imagination.

I'm still wating for job opening or interview invitation"
"Process is good, people involved are pleasant, presentation is clear and attractive, maybe just the timings for application in different locations is a bit unclear. I wouldn't recommend to apply to people from my country because the company only seeks for the region of work eligibility and for Russians it is usually a problem, so it is logical to conclude that company is not interested in Russian talents."
Process is  not transparent...I didn't get any update or an interview call even after my profile got shortlisted. Really got disappointed.

Personal response
Personal feedback on success or failure to get the position
Personal contact with people who do the effort to apply is the best way to keep the company image high. Even if the answer is not positive people will appreciate the effort to contact them and will also learn what to improve if they know the reason why they are not selected.
Perhaps you should give a precise yet immediate feedback as to what the status of the application of one applicant within one week or 4 days in maximum.
Perhaps provide more updates about the application progress.
Perhaps an email acknowledgment 
Perhaps add a personal touch to the correspondence for applicants who have a applied to multiple positions.

No，it's already great!
Nowadays Companies are flooded with CVs against a single opening and the CVs which look concise and impressive at the same time matches the requirement criteria are generally shortlisted for interview. However the pitfall of the process is a genuine candidate who could not impress the recruiters with his CV may fail to get a call.Such a problem has been widely addressed by referral route or walk in interview process. However there is still a traditional method which can be used in this context when a job consultant checks a profile and meets the candidate to understand his true potential can recommend the candidate to the Company and Company may interview such candidate based on the confidence reposed on the job consultant.Such a traditional process can bypass the  smart look aspect of a CV and help the Company to connect to the right candidate.

Individually these factors or points have to be developed and carried out to get the employees you are looking for.

Organizations mostly cater to those whom they will potentially hire, perhaps a new leader in HR practices could emerge as a organization which helps those individuals who get declined for specific job roles."

Nobody had called me then how are i asking this survey? Are u really going to check these comments and improve??? Mark my words u will never do it and u r sending this survey form for the sake of sending...
Nobody contacts the candidate even after submission of application for any post through an email (except auto generated email) Or phone. This  creates the doubt that JNJ is not even looking at the applicant's profile. This is been my experience at leastfor last 10 times.
Nobody contacted me.
Nobody contacted me at all so maybe you can start by working on that. 
No... Response at all... Need to improve very much.. 
"No, I don not work at Johnson.  I am wanting to obtain an application for employment."
No sir .It all Depends on how best performance of the candidate 
No response from company side..
"NO RESPONSE AGAINST  APPLICATION OF THE POST.......atleast recruiter has to inform fit or not for the job. 

thankyou

no reply.......
No remarks and not reply current status
"No recruiter contacted me regarding the entire process, was not informed of it"
"no proper reason given! Just a standard NO bla bla, sad, because if a proper reason would be given, it would appear, that JJ really cared about the person applying for the position. I believe the position applied for, deserves a proper feedback, otherwise JJ is no different to any other employer, and I guess thats why you take the survey to find out.
Best regards Martin"
no process
"No phone screening , no opportunity to interact with applicant ,standard list of questions should be crafted for each recruitment "
"No one got in touch with me in spite of my profile being a good match to the job requirements 
"
no one ever contact me at all.
No one contacted me for interview process. At least I could be interviewed and then rejected. All this interview process is all eye wash procedures.
No one contacted me and I haven't hear anything from J&J
No need to change.
No more I found it really professional process
"No interaction with J&J except an email to say I am not shortlisted, so nothing to comment. "
No information provide why you are not selected... Even I fullfill the criteria..
No improvement needed people there are delivering the best. Thank you 
No improvement is required........
No idea 
NO EFFICIENT FEEDBACK! KIND OF WASTING OF TIME!
No contact with potential candidates. Asking someone to fill out a survey when they havent even had a courtosy email to say if the application was not successful us a waste. 
"No communication. Nothing human about the process, we are treated like data and people interested in becoming part of your company."
No comments.
No comments because your recruitment process is too bad and now I don't want to work your company it's a bad manners and very bad experience 
No comments as I have only a very superficial knowledge about the process that Johnson and Johnson has as its standard operating process for global recruitment.

never even got an email with the decision of 3 roles I applied to. 
Needs more transparency

Every applicant have a expectation and appropriate communication should improve the system."
Need to revised whole process.
need to notify reasons of not acceptance to applicants
Need to more interaction with right candidate.and explore the opportunity.
Need to know the reason for rejecting as a feed back not for hr point of view it helps the applicants to improve . 
Need to improve
need to implement micro management process.  
NEED TO HAVE FACE TO FACE ROUND FOR THE SUITABLE CANDIDATE AS PER THE EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATION
Need to get feedback if the resume is not selected
Need to contact or inform once to candiate
Need to contact directly to the candidate  form Hr.depertmen. ..not depend on individual recruiter. .

"My submission is to consider the eagerness to take challenge/new role, work with heart attitude & continuous learning etc of the candidate in addition to qualification and experience; "
My only concern was that nobody from the talent acquisition team contacted me after my interview to follow up. 
"My impression of J&J as viewed from the outside is that it's a strong company with a great history; however, my experience with the recruitment process has lowered my impression.  With the three jobs I've applied to, I received a standard format rejection email within a day or two of the application with no details on why.  I question whether or not my resume was even sent to the hiring manager.  If the staffing department is screening applications either electronically or by other means without getting information to the hiring manager, I believe J&J is missing out on some highly talented individuals.  I recommend more detailed feedback to candidates who are interested in working for J&J.  Thank you."
my experience is not good since i was offered and process all the requirement and medical but during the visa application they are not successful they should have appeal since i have already invested so much time and effort
"Must inform the status with a dashboard, so that the person can check "
Must contact thoae who are applied. 
"Must be a phone call interview before you reject the applications 
"
Motivate the real reasons why the candidate is not selected. It is preferable not to receive any answer rather than receiving the standard email. 
"Most of the time I used to apply for job in J&J at its portal. But I didn't get any call from HR recruitment of J&J till date.
Kindly give me an opportunity for you interview. I am keenly interested to be a dynamic part of your esteemed organisation.

Kindly do the needful.
Thanking you.

More transparent about their process and open to diverse candidates.
More timely updates and feedback on the recruitment results.
More prompt response on notification step in recruitment
More Proactive follow up 
"More personalised recruitment process eg. contacting candidates, providing status update on their application. Rely more on human intervention rather than system search for key word matching and filtering potential good candidates"
More opportunities for people who wish to challenge themselves and have the willpower to learn and give it all for the company. 
More open 
More one on one detailed description of the position and the process. 
More interactive and fast processing. Not just relying on the internet for its initial processes.
More interaction
More Human relations - and at least answer to candidates
"More feedback as to why the candidate was not suitable for the role, only received an email to say I wasn't been put forward then a barrage of these surveys!!"
More feedback 
More fair opportunities & more job openings 
"More constructive feedback would be appreciated.


Example of what I received:

""We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Medical Advisor - Oncology (Solid Tumours) (1700148898W) at Janssen-Cilag Pty Ltd"""
"More consistent practice within recruitment team.  I've sent quite a number of applications to Johnson & Johnson over the years and only received feedback from a few. This is actually worse than companies which do not send feedback and rejection letters at all, as you'll be keeping candidates hanging and hoping.  I'm sure Johnson & Johnson can do better."
More communication.
"more communication, more friendly."
More communication on the application results including feedback and reason of not being successful. Suggestions on alternative potions or could the potential candidate could further improve in future application with the company. indicate what is important to increase the success in the application later on.
More communication
"More clarity on reasons of rejection.
A greater clarity on actual requirements - skill, renumeration, location, demands. upfront. "
Minimize the formalities of Recruiting process
"Meeting personally to job seekers is the most 
Effective way to recruit the right person"
maybe they can suggest any position available according to the ability of the applicant based on his or her credentials.
"maybe showing the employment process and feedback on the Internet, let us know the precise progress, it would be much better for us to find what we want."
Maybe provide reasoning for rejections as to learn from that experience. 
Maybe provide more vacancies for us graduates. Thank you.
Maybe improve the response time and provide updates of application to applicants 
"Maybe giving some feedback about the processes and the reasons to be rejected, real ones."
Maybe advise the applicants with regards to the status via email or phone call. It is better to tell the truth and advise them. Thank you

May be more brief details about what someone needs to do in futureor mentioning which skills to improve. 
Making the HR a coordinator in the internal employee recruitment and also the interview process.
Make the process clear and give proper feedback (specific for candidates)
Make the interviews as soon as possible.
Make personal contact especially for high profile positions such as this one
Make it more transperent. Ensure atleast 2 -3 interviewers for the interview to ensure no bias. If there is a prefered candidate for the post no interview should be conducted for other candidates. 
"Make it fair for all applicants... The recritment experience has been frustrating

Over the past few years I have applied to a couple of positions in J&J.  even though my experience and qualifications have met the selection criteria requested (in both cases), I have never had a chance to reach the interview phase and share my experience...

The reasons for this remain unknown for me... However it makes me think that the recruitment team could have received more applications than it is able to handle, or the recruiter is biased disregarding applicants who have foreign background/experience*?...

(*) I am an Australian citizen borned overseas, with an extensive experience in the pharmaceutical industry not only locally but also abroad.



"
"Make it easier to apply to various roles.  It seems that the job board only allows you to have one profile, and if there are several applications live the profile cannot be tailored.
I understand that J&J is a large company but it would be worthwhile to make the process more personal, including giving relevant feedback on why one was unsuccessful for a role."

like most other organizations JnJ recruitment process is very standard and robotic 
Let us know the reason why we are not good fit and let us give a chance to prove ourselves
Let us know if we are qualified as an applicant or not. Thank you.
Let the candidate know the reason why he is not selected for round of interviews.
Let people know why they weren't considered 
Let candidates know if they are not successful and why not.
Let candidate know the progress of the recruitment process and reasons why specific profile was not shortlisted.
Let applicants know if they are selected for the Programme 
Let applicants know if successful or not.  This is the first I have heard in any form about the job I applied for.  Very poor.
Let applicants know if he/she was accepted/declined or not
Less chemicals & more organic. maintain quality
"less biasness in selection process of candidates, more diversity and fairness in providing equal opportunity to ALL RACES and clearly define protocols if you are willing to sponsor working visa or not in your job ads!"
"Learn to respect applicants. J&J might be the best company, but please remember, people make companies, it's not the other way around. I'll think thrice as to what value addition can J&J do for me b4 reapplying for any position. "

Keep the records of candidate and as suitable vacancy arise then need to mail concerned candidate for interview .
Keep the candidates informed
Keep the candidate informed in a timely fashion. I received notification for 6 months even though I was an internal JNJ candidate
Keep the candidate informed and reflection post application if unsuccessful 
Keep the applicant posted on the recruitment status if the position is filled by selected incumbent and therefore the recruitment is closed.
Keep potential candidates informed of the recruitment process. Don't leave it for weeks on end to advise you haven't been selected as you are not a strong candidate. A phone interview should at least be conducted first & then rule you out if you feel the person does not have the skills 
Keep it up. Thank You
Keep close contact with Skype etc.

Also I strongly believe in the power of personal recommendation, as it minimizes the unknowns and saves time. Based on my research, Johnson and Johnson already applies ""employee referral schemes"" which is almost the same with the recommendation schemes."
Just the number 1 question
Just need to give opportunity to freshers than experienced person's..
Just go through the attached resume and then decide.
just give a chance to those who dont have a science background but has a good experience in pharmaceuticals company...because most people who are not bsc qualified ....they are BCOM..OR having some other graduate degree ..but if they are having good sales experience in pharma ..company should consider them..
"Just even ask for face to face interview, it will imbibe confidence of incumbent in future"
Just enough
Just continue what you're doing.
Just be transparent in approach.
Just a simple email to inform the candidate that they were not successful would be sufficient
Johnson should email and make a phone call to the eligible candidate 
Johnson and Johnson should be professional enough to give feedback to applicants regarding the status of their application.

Johnson and Johnson is one of the well-known and career teaching company where I can generate growth for my future and improve my socio-economic condition too.
"Johnson and Johnson is a good company, I fully understood there are too many resumes coming and someone might squeen it in second, to decide next step or not. It would be appreciated if candidate could have a positive feedback during recruitment processes."
"Johnson & Jonhson is an multinational company, applications for job comes from diverse cultures with someone  having education and experience in same field but overseas, 
If applicants demonstrate all the qualifications required for their respective job, they should get a chance for an interview where recruiters can check their eligibility giving them role play, educational background and all other things which recruiters required from applicants for the available position.
Having gone through Resume and deciding that applicants are not suitable for job is the thing which HR team should rethink.

"Johnson & Johnson take the help of software through which applicant check the feedback of his/her job interview performance. It has 2 way benefit system specially meant for employer-employee relationship.
1) Interested candidates improve their shortcoming and prepare for next opportunity.
2) Employer get a chance to better understand the organization best fit employee rather than take the help of heuristics method.

Johnson & Johnson should update on the employment status and contact the applicants if their applications is succeesful. There is no news in any recruiters. 
"Johnson & Johnson should provide reason why applicants are not hired or not included in short list of candidates. These way we will know what things we need to improved or at least include in our CV's.

Johnson & johnson recruiter must interact to the candidate through telephonic mode through questionnaire.
"Johnson & Johnson need to provide information or acknowledgement email to the applicant especially to those who applied online that unfortunately they're not been shortlisted or selected in the said position. Not it because they're not been shortlisted or selected they were already disregarded to inform why they are not suitable or they did not meet the required qualification which the company is looking for before closing it, if ever the company has already chosen or hired the qualified one."
"Johnson & Johnson is very reputed organisation, may be Singapore HR is not very active in making rapport with candidates. Example is I applied for a position and never got any call or mail but I got a mail to fill the survey. Anyways , J&J is great brand across the globe , I strongly feel that this is a great organisation to work with. Looking forward for future engagement with J&J"
Johnson & Johnson is my dream company. Recruit me into Johnson & Johnson big family make me very satisfied.

"Johnson & Johnson is brand name in market for its branded products. 

Already its have good & best recruitment process,but for improvement
few points are to be consider for better  candidate recruitment

1. Candidate professional & Skill background check.
2. Awareness knowledge  of current & future market strategics.
3, Competitor products knowledge. 
4. Body language of performance.
5. Sincerity and pension of work load etc.
6. Market  data Analyses reports  
7. Reporting & performance records."
Johnson & Johnson could send a email to inform us if we have been accepted or rejected from a job
"Johnson & Johnson company's product is very smooth , non effective  for all user, so everone use friendly."
"Johnson & Johnson can improve the recruitment process by having a little more detail in the body of their reply email stating one or more reasons why the candidate does not make a good fit, especially when a candidate has a proven track record of 10 years sales/account management experience, including 4 years in FMCG, holds university degrees and took the time to also write out a cover letter. 

I truly believe I am more than qualified for the role I applied for, and a generic email reply stating that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy is a quick and lazy option to do the bare minimum in notifying candidates. 

Hope this helps you with some personal feedback, please feel free to contact me if you need further detail. My mobile number is +61408 232 231

"Johnson & Johnson can hire me do to improve the recruitment process.
I consider communication is the most important skill for an HR professional, Getting the line managers engaged by helping them to understand what the HR support would mean for them.
HR team can support them by creating a standard HR process.

Planning, making sure that the HR strategy is aligned and supporting the business strategy.
Reducing overall HR cost.

After all I consider Johnson & Johnson products are the best i market specially shampoo and oil.

Thank you Johnson & Johnson you are doing a great job."
"Johnson & Johnson as organisation should give chance to people with ambitions and higher aspirations . While recruiting they should consider individual as better fit match for the role and not based on their profile to get best outcome in long run .
In recent years this has been happening a lot where individuals with great experience within organisation are unable to get chance to further develop themselves and put in their best practices while freshers with completely no experience are considered only because of their profile .
Credo is one of the most important part of this organisation and people involved in recruitment team should strictly follow and consider it . "
"Johnson & Johnson as a company holds a good employer brand,but I think the recruitment process is no different from any other recruitment agencies- scanning and selecting resumes/CV's using key word search rather than actually reading through the resume to identify potential incumbents.While I understand there will be hundreds of resumes to read through but if you have right Talent Management in place then time should not be an issue to fill in for the positions.
I had applied for two roles in your company and got a mail response for one stating my resume does not match,haven't received for the other role yet so am I to believe that my resume is under consideration??which I doubt,as it has been many days now.So please make sure you are consistent with your process for every job opportunities you create. 
I would also like to suggest that do not push for feedback form from applicants if you have not personally spoken to or contacted with respect to the job application.
And finally ask for feedback or opinion if you are truly interested in hearing out and want to work towards improvement and not for just another process that needs to be ticked off.
Have a good day,

"J&J should keep a good validating system so that as soon as someone express interest in the company the person over there should conduct a small interaction and forward its feedback to the HR people for further action.
Moreover if HR thins that She/He is fit then they should start further conversation and if not a small thanks giving note for expressing their interest in your esteemed organisation.
This little gesture will enhance your respectability in the market."

"J&J recruitment process is fair and reasonable. In case talent acquistion team share more frequent updates, it will be very beneficial to interviewees."
"J&J needs to respond the reason why candidates are not suitable for the position. For good candidates, J&J should keep their profiles for future suitable job.

"
J&J needs to actually follow up with the candidate. I mailed the recruiter twice after the interview asking for an update and received no reply. FIVE months after the interview I got a rejection email. 
J&J need to setup a screen algorithm properly. If your system reject an application within12 hours after it submitted. It clearly no one read it at all
"J&J is one of top company in the world and Every process should be gone with that. I got a reply after 5 month without any mention.

"J&J could open the information data of applicants for applicants such as age, gender, university, major and experience etc. Hence, future applicants can estimate their positions."
"J&J can improve the recruitment process if:
* someone will monitor the system who are the possible candidates, then right there and then they can get an update whether if they have schedule for interview or none.
* J&J can also send sms update to all candidates the moment they are successfully apply in any position posted at the website."

its very best recruitment process for to improve the employ capability and found good knowledge

Its good

and fail or pass for some application doesn't matter. I'd like to get feedback, a result of the applying, from recruiter by e-mail or a call. "
It's the one of best fastest growing company in India. The Work environmental of this company  is very good. People feel provide to be part of the company is provides full support their employees in front in has many branches across the world so I have good opportunity   to show my telnet
It's just great that I felt amazing when I was first entering the recruiting website. Fascinating!
"It's good to have a quick survey as part of the recruitment process, I recommend to have like a ""Personal Touch"" with your potential employers through personal email, sms, or a phone call to know their status regarding their application. Thanks!"
It's good to contact a person once in order to inform about the post
"It's a very vague process.
I've applied for a number of roles and this is the only correspondence I have received.
"
It would have been nice to get a reply given I worked with J&J for 7 years.
"It would be of great help if the HR team would inform the candidates if their profile has been rejected. According to me this is basic HR ethics. Further these are the small steps that really helps in not only building an ethical work climate within the organisation but also communicates to various stakeholders about the organisation's values.
If not through email the status of the application can be updated on the profile of the candidate. 
Further this questioner can be desired in a better way, as there was a question which was not applicable in my case but did not have that option.
Further people should be treated as people who have varied experiences and can bring in innovation and diversity rather than just a the 'required work experience'. Anyway in my case, even when I had the required experience and skill set as mentioned in the job description (in my opinion)  in research, I still do not know why my profile was not even shortlisted for primarily round of interview/s.
Johnson and Johnson came across as an organisation which is laid back and does not really bother about people who they don't seem can be useful at that particular moment.

It would be highly appreciated if J&J can provide a feedback for rejecting the application. Thank you.
"It would be great if we get to know the reason why we have not been selected, so that we can improve ourselves for future roles. 

I have been applying in J & J for the past one year, but never I have ever got the response stating the reason for rejection."
It would be good to get back to individuals to at least let them know that they were not selected.
It would be good to acknowledge receipt of applications and let candidates know if they are unsuccessful.
It would be good if we could receive an indication of the selection process and an approximation of how long before we would get a reply.
"It would be better if J&J can:
1. Provide the real time status of applications. I am not sure as to the status of all of my applications with J&J or if it has even reached anyone at all. In the past I only get the automated email requiring a log-in on the J&J Talent community or yet another automated email saying it has been closed already and that I was not considered.
2. Ensure that the openings being advertised through other job search portals are in synch' with those in the J&J Recruitment portal. I was informed via Jobstreet of a General Accountant post so I proceeded to the Talent community to look for it but did not find it at that time. Since I am likewise interested in the Fixed Asset Accountant II post I decided to also apply."
"It would be a good practice to provide a reasoning for a rejection, instead of sending a generic mail - especially when it comes to recruitment roles"
It would  be nice to know why my profile as not shortlisted for recruitment. 
It will be much better to communicate with more detailed feedback not the typical explanation.
"It was not good impression for candidate were waiting in front of elevator, not in the proper waiting area. And, no one indicated further process when the final interview was finished, e.g. they will contact in few days or you will receive email regarding interview result etc."
"It was just a bit slow. I was informed I would be scheduled for another interview after a week or 2, but when I followed up I was rejected. But nonetheless, I still believe J&J is a good employer and would still pursue having a career in the organization. "
It should give information about the selection process properly.
It should be transperant for all the aspirant. 
it should be mentioned somewhere if there is some criteria not to consider the candidate on the basis of his/her previous interview review to avoid his/her effort loss. 
"It should be in speed process,,and recruiters did not invite me for interview and even I didn't get the call or mail from recruiter"
It should be fast.
It should at least contact the individual who is not fit to join and give him/her an assurance for any other vaccancies. It should also advice to join the talent community for any suitable match in future. It least it should not demotivate anyone who is an extreme lover of Johnson and Johnson like me!
"It seems that finding job offer list was not user friendly.
I think that it would be better off if the link activated on the job opening poster."
It must decrease the time which consumed to replay for applicant 
It is very rude from your side atleast jnj should have the courtesy to prompt reply by mentioning the reason for not selecting. 
it is upto the mark.
It is understandable that the sheer volume of applications make it difficult for you to get in touch with all the applicants. But please do try to at least deliver the message if an applicant is rejected. It would be very much appreciated. 
It is not easy telephone interviews in English to Koreans. So call quality is important. Because of  sound is the only tool of communication. How about using a video call rather than a voice call?
"It is good process  but can do litter fast for selection . The process is little time consuming  rest all thing is well.

Thanks"
It is good
"It is better to became more clear Interview process. For example, I receive the offer for next recruiting process 3week later since I took interview. I manage interview process of some companies at same time, then it is hard to keep motivation for your company even if it is interested for me."
It is better for people such as HR/hiring manager to intervene.
"It is better for J&H hr team to go deep into the swot analysis of submitted resume of candidate then should be  considered for further face to face evaluation of his personality, confidence, and fitness judgment of the specific role pinned for."
"It is best to review the credibility of the candidates based on their work experiences,  job performances rather than switch them off just by seeing they haven't got the valid visa yet.

They have a valid reason for not having it yet but have a proper letter to explain that they are eligible to work in New Zealand. The candidate has gone through a tedious process just to make sure they are eligible to work in New Zealand but most of the recruitment or should I say the system just shut you off because of visa and it is contradicting to the NZ immigration which encourage skilled migrant to apply for jobs  

"
it is always a good courtesy to provide a real reason - as per why the person was rejected. Not using 1 common answer.
It is already quite good.
"It is all good to go.Although, They must begin form telephonic round. "
it is a best step which J&J follows  were candidate himself upload his data but need little bit quick response but i can understand recruiting right person takes time after evaluating him in each and every process but over all process is best but need little quicker response from talent acquisition team
"It has been a few weeks after my application and there is now news yet, would appreciate if there is an email to update us on the status other than asking us to take survey for the second time. Thank you and have a nice day"
"It felt like a robot reviewed my application. No feedback offered or provided. The rejection note started ""dear sir or madam"" - how impersonal! Just say ""hello"" or use the info in my application to show my name. It was a very impersonal process and I found it disappointing "
It depends from the hr department on how improvement they want to apply in the recruitment process..
It can be said that process Can be a little swifter.
It a amazing experience to see the process.its make more transparent and loyal.
"Is my feedback is necessary to the organisation if yes then what extent. 
I already given the feedback earlier . I don't see any changes. "
Interviewing proper candidate Nd providing opportunities
Interview process is ok.
Interview process  should influence the canditate.No biasing sholud be there by the person who is taking the interview. 
"Interactive fun is good and I suggest the recruitment process needs improvement. I have gone through the interview process once in 2013 and other candidate was selected. It was a nice experience as fresher to go through the three phase interview process at BADDI unit. Lots of improvement is required like counselling for the one   who are new to the field, conducting online Interviews like video conferencing is another option. "
"Instead of just saying they have chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position, the recruitment team should provide the candidates with reasons why they are not a good fit for the positions applied for."
Information sharing to the candidate needs to be improved
"Inform the status of application, whether the applicant is suitable for the position or not. 

Thank you."
Inform the outcome of the recruitment process such as under review or unsuccessful.
Inform the applicant at least via email the status of their application. 
"inform candidates if they haven't been selected for interview, it's common courtesy."
Inform candidate on the result
Include video conferences with the candidates in the recruitment process. This will help to have a complete profile of the candidates.
Include a timeline of your recruitment process
"In this particular situation, the recruitment process was very slow. Following my initial interview with the hiring manager, I was told she would set up a second interview for me to meet her direct manager within a week or two. I was never invited to a second interview. The hiring manger also said she would set up an opportunity for me to shadow a current employee, again this was never arranged and i was never told why?
The hiring process took so long and I was not receiving updates, therefore I took it upon myself to call the HR team myself to find out what was happening. 
After a number of weeks, I received an email stating that I was not successful. 
I never received feedback about my application and why I was not successful or why I had not had a second interview? 
Better & timely communication is key!"
"In the future, hope you will advise me why I wasn't selected for the position I applied to."
"In the early stages, a simple update email would suffice to inform candidates if they are still in the process or have been rejected. This can even be automated.  For later stages in the interview process, especially after a few iterations, if the candidate has been rejected, brief feedback as to areas of improvement would go a long way."
In my words please give me feedback as early as possible.
"In my words at recruiter is working for the candidate rather than the company. Recruiter should tell the candidates what types of questions to expect and how to prepare, including suggested websites and blogs to read before showing up. This type of approach actually makes so much sense because a recruiter's job is to make sure the two people fall in love (the candidate and the hiring manager). 

In this case, the recruiter should do everything he/she could to make candidate win and if the candidate wins, it is ultimately a win for the company."
"In my opinion, your system for recruitment process is really good. But, I think J&J can do campus hire, or at least J&J can make an event like ""J&J goes to campus"" to increase students' interest and knowledge to join J&J. I read that J&J did that event in US, but not in Indonesia. The last, reviewed all of survey by your recruitment team to consider if there some candidates that may have really good potential but not match with this system(website), please do not rely only on system(website). Thank you so much for consider me for this position, sorry if my words are too much."
"In my opinion, recruiter need to evaluate the application and contact by means of at least email and provide a reason why my application is not a good fit for the position I applied to."
"In my opinion, Johnson and Johnson has excellent recruitment process and no need to improve."
"In my case, I opened e-mail via smart phone. some of your e-mail was broken or cannot link it"
"In house people need to be promoted like other mnc does with out showing any reason,"
"In case of not completing process, feed applicant back by the reasons."
"In addition to via e-mail, can also be through a phone call. From there a candidate who fails can communicate directly with a recruiter."
Improving the quality of after-sales service
Improvement is subject to the recruiter make efforts to get in touch telephonically but the recruiter showed no respone as if was not important for him. 
Improvement in the response time is possible
Improve the recruitment process - inform candidates if they have not been shortlisted with a brief feedback if possible.
"Improve the humanity of your process. Aside from communicating why we fit your organization, J&J needs to also communicate what sets itself apart as an employer. When I have the opportunity to ask this question to potential employers, very few can give me an answer that truly differentiates them. They seem to be oblivious that if five years ago, their company has a clear employer-value proposition, that may not be the case now."
"Improve the communication process.
Advise why applicant is unsuccessful for the role"
Improve the candidates short list selection process.
Improve processing time.
improve personalization of communications
"Improve on communication 

feedback forms is only a formality , paper work  "
Improve feedback mechanism
"Improve everything. 
Slow process
No updates"
Improve engagement with the applicants.
Improve communication. No response that the application had even been received. No response that I'd been unsuccessful. I would value a response as an applicant. Poor experience.
"Improve communication with applicants, and implement a fair process"
"Improve communication process.
Was asked to apply from recruiter but was then never followed up with"
Improve communication (E.g. reply faster when 1st selection filter is completed)
Implementation of standard QbD in recruitment process.
"Immediate response on employment needs , to speed up employment process"
Immaterial of whether J&J selects or rejects a candidate - they need to communicate it to the candidate. Just having closure is important
"If you give an accurate role description and an opportunity to interview an applicant,  you will be more improve the recruitment process .
Please, Give me a chance to interview.
Thank you. Have a nice day~!!"
if vacancy is there please try to contact candidate immediately because many employees want to work in reputed pharma company.
if u change the systems the part of the mind that mediates between the conscious and the unconscious and is responsible for reality testing and a sense of personal identity. 
"If this is a part of a human capital management improvement, I could say there is still a lot to improve. As I applied for seven position I have only five replies, not bad, but for those two position that don't have reply it would be eternal waiting if only those two positions I have applied for. Though automation is vital in achieving a quality hiring process still manual intervention is the appropriate solution as AI has not gone at par with manual assessment."
"If they weekly update the position of the resume submitted, that would be great endeavor to the aspirants.
thanks "
If they not accepted experience applicants they need to give  a clarified convincing reasons for this
If there was no call for the internal employees for better positions then it need to clarified the reason for non selection so that the employee can develop himself for next upcoming opportunity.
"If someone are not fit for J&J's position, then please e-mail and tell them about it"
"If some candidate enrolled for recruitment to you Johnson & Johnson site u have to take them upon top priority instead of giving priority to the confidantes from the 3 rd party consultancy.
We r enrolled on your site for making our bright future."
If possible to provide early information if the person applying is qualified or not for the position. 
"If Possible please try to contact with applicant because they are full focusing on you . but it is far days applied still there is no response that you are eligible or not instead of this Company want rating their Requirement  and others things.

"If possible please inform candidates whether they are shortlisted or not, if not then you may state the reason. I applied to this position and I only get survey forms to fill. Till now I don't know what is the status of my application. This survey is not relevant to me at all because I haven't gone through any recruitment process yet."
"If possible explain to the candidate, the reasons why we are not good for the position."
If person has applied for the position then recruiter should at least contact that person.
If not recruiting ，please contact with me immediately 
If it would have been better if you give a pass / fail message to the person who applied for.
"If I'm not for the post, just drop me an email tell me about it. Bit I got no feedback at all so far."
"If I was not a fit, let me know immediately via an automated email.  I don't expect a recruiter to call me to let me know that I was not a good fit.  At lease an email from the career portal to let me know that I was not a good fit...not after 4-5 months after the initial application."
"If find CV suitable, pleae call for interview."
"If candidate has not been selected, at least should be informed that you have not been selected at this occasion "
"If candidate had refused some previous offers because of some reason, and still the Candidate is applying to some job opportunities in future, I think recruiters must consider his or her application. "
"If any, please provide email address of local Johnson & Johnson"
If any one is not eligible or pursuing course then after completion of course contact that person . For making their interest. 
If all of the above has been done. A feedback as to why you were considered not fit for the role despite having fulfilled all qualifications stated in the JD would have been appreciated

"I've submitted over a dozen applications, and have never been contacted by a recruiter. 

I view J&J as poorly skilled at evaluating talent. "
"I've received this email half a dozen times but not once a response via email or phone regarding my submission for the CM role.

I spend on average 3-4hrs on selection criteria (second person to proof read) & would bill you for a days wages if I was a sole trader. Especially after receiving multiple survey emails I regard as junk mail as I did not give permission for your business to fill up my Inbox with surveys & yes I read the fine print. That's what I do for a living read & negotiate contracts. 

Please remove me from your email list or have me in for interview. Either way an action is required in your part here & now. 

Thank you,

"I'm sorry, I didn't experience the interview of Johnson, so I can not give a effective reply."
"I'm somewhat confused as to why no contact was made to discuss the positions that I applied for. My qualifications(MBA) and experience (over 10years local and international) were a match for the role description so I can only assume there were other factors at play.

"
I'm not sure. Being a J&J employee I see the job listings on the Intranet and that is fine for me.
"I'm not sure this message would be seen by someone or not. But I do want to say something through this platform.

First, I have to confess that the position didn't fit for me to some extent, I 'm good at research and technic works, The only reason I tried this postion was that it was probably the best work I can do in Xi'an Janssen before I know the positon of technical transfer manager.
Second, the only feeling I had about the recutiment process was the low efficiency. I believe that a good interviewer,no matter by telephone of face-to-face talk, can judge one if he is fit for  the positon or not in half an hour.please don't make so many telephone interviews after the face to face talks. that would give the interviewee a wrong hint that he or she still have the chance. By the way, those telephone interview, no matter made by whom, asked same quetions.

J & J is a great company I long for, It was a pity that I failed the interview. But I still take it as one of my treasure experience. 

Thank you!

"I'm herewith requesting you please do shortlist the candidates by their skills & competencies and not by their educational institute (IIT/REC) or their previous job experience in similar industries.

Arabindo T."
I'd like you to consider the will of the applicants.
I would've preferred a technical screening via phone or skype before being rejected for a position. Sometimes the application forms do not capture the full breadth of expertise and experience of a candidate. 
I would suggest to look into talent which is much more exposed to the pharmaceutical environment rather considering people who have experience in a single feild.
I would suggest that the recruitment process should be more informative regarding the progress of candidate's application in most favorable time. 
I would really appreciate if the recruitment team can send a notification if the application process was not successful and the reason for not making it. 
I would love to work with J&J and would request you to kindly consider me for the interview
I would like to understand that I did not get any response since I am based out of the area where I applied.
I would like to know the reason why i did not fit for the job. 
I would like to know the reason why I am not a good fit for the position I've applied for.
I would like to have more information of the position I recuite.
"I would highly appreciate if any body from jnj SALES or HR revert for any feedback from company about my candidature so that I should know the status of my application.

Regards,"
I would have appreciated the opportunity to understand what qualifications you were looking for and to get some specific feedback on my application.
I would definitely appreciate any specific feedback on what I can improve on to be considered on future applications with your company. Unfortunately I only received a generic rejection message.
I would appreciate to have initial discussion with me to understand about me before making any decision. I will provide better perspective about me.
"I wonder my conditon as an applicant for Johnson&Johnson in recruitment process, so I hope that  people who apply for this company could find the condition of the recruitment process."
I wish someone would have reached out to me about the position. If there's experience I lack or even if there's a position that might be a better fit. These surveys are the only reason I feel my application was received which feels very impersonable.
I will improve my day to day practice 
"I will help a lot if the recruitment team had replied to my online application, at least through email.  If the  applicant's qualifications did not meet the requirements of the position being applied for,  there may be other positions in which the qualifications may be considered relevant.  I still believe that any form of communication or interaction between HR and an applicant will always yield positive results.  Thank you.  "
I will be lucky if I getting a opertunity to proove my skill and experience in your organization. 
I was unable to attach my cover letter
"I was truly disappointed by the recruitment process of J&J, not only did I not hear anything from the relevant team but also the process took way to long and didn't adhere to any timeline. I am no happily working for a global PE house in London. Thank you J&J."
"I was surprised that no phone call was made. I am obviously a recruiter and i do not judge a potential candidate by a resume. If someone makes the effort to submit an application a quick call to find out why they feel they would be suitable for the role only takes a few minutes. Surely candidates deserve a call rather than an instant rejection email. (within 30 minutes of my application to be exact).
I work in IT, some roles i advertise i get over 60 odd applications and yet it is still common courtesy to call the candidate and see what it is that they are after.
We are not in the game of bums on seats, Talent Acquisition / Recruitment is all about changing lives, finding the best opportunity for the candidate whether its an internal role or not."
I was referred by a J&J employee and the link which was sent to me did not log in. I tried reaching out on every possible channel but it still didn't work. You should really work on a technical troubleshooting mechanism.
I was not given any opportunity have an interface with J & J recruitment team so I am not in a position to comment on this
I was not contacted by HR department about the development or progress of this recruitment.I expected at least i might have been called personally for interview.I was not even invited for interview with Franchise director.
"I was not contacted by any recruiter yet, i was eagerly waiting to hear from you for interview or anything, and here i receive this mail about my recruitment experience??? what is this? can i get interview call or mail before answering this survey?

Regards
Swati"
I was not contacted by a recruiter or involved in any recruiting activity.  I found the job position online.  
I was not and never been contacted by any personal for my candidature. 
"I was not able to login to JnJ account with the username and password. I contacted talent acquisition team but didn't get any reply. I have not got any call from the recruiter also.
Kindly improve this."
"I was never contacted regarding the position I applied for. I was, however, emailed about 5 times regarding this survey. "
I was never contacted nor was screened. 
I WAS NEVER CONTACTED BY ANY J&J RECRUITER FOR ANY POSITIONS.
I was never contacted and did not go through any recruitment process. 
"I was left unnoticed for my application result. I was not even sure whether I am right to fill up this survey that begins with ""Did the recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to?""

Of course, it is quite impossible for J&J Talent Acquisition team to provide a ""helpful"" reason to every failed application, especially when J&J is a reputable company and hence receiving large volume of applications. But, at least, please notify everyone of his/her application result. Some might put in lots of effort into this application. You do not want to skip to appreciate those really did despite a majority did not. It is not a good bargain really if you have a long-term perspective. And please provide a true reason, not a politically correct one, like ""You're excellent but..."". It is not ""helpful"" and ""genuine"" really.

Of course, I take every opportunity to sell myself, including here:

Currently, I am a Finance Trainee under Global Service Centre World Health Organisation in Cyberjaya, Malaysia.

I am always driven to create social capital. Prior to this employment, I was volunteering for a church in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia as a Ministry Apprentice, where my main role was teaching. 

Therefore, J&J interests me because it sells consumer goods or I call them society goods.

"I was informed that the position in HK was cancelled during the interview. The interviewer then asked me whether I'm interested in working in Taiwan and she would pass my profile to the Taiwan office. However, I was informed earlier that I was not accepted by the Taiwan office before receiving the interview invitation for the position in HK. I then was informed few weeks later that I was not accepted at the end. It seems to me that there are some errors in the system where the information internally is not aligned. "
"I was impressed by the follow-up to applicants who were not qualified.

"
"I was given an email with message that I am not qualified for the position. the email was quick but it would have been better to understand the reason why. 

But, nevertheless, J&J has one of the progressive initial recruitment process. "
"I was disappointed to have had to wait 3 months before I heard back from you about a position that I was very keen on. Finally when an automated reply came through, there was no specific reason as to why I was not even called in for an interview. "
"I was asked to complete this survery before I was contacted to be advised that I was unsuccessful with my job application!  This is is not the best way to learn that that you have not been successful and should be looked at.

If I completed this survey I had not been contacted, so my survey answers would have been different."
"I was a J&J employee from Jan 2007 to May 2010. My 2nd assignment was as a contract based employee, but had to leave at the end of the contract as there was a hiring freeze in 2010. During my employment at J&J, I was nominated for the Standards of Leadership Award as I have very strong management and SAP skills.

After leaving J&J I applied for more than 50 jobs, but was interviewed only once, and that was the only time J&J had contacted me.

"I want to work at J&J.
Thank you so much.
"
"I want to reduce Communication gap between you and me.
My no. 7506270030"
I want to know why I am not good for the position and how evaluate who is a good fit for the position.
I want to join to Johnson & Johnson
i want join 
"I want J&J

1) more energically to select the talent people among the HR DB and contact them in person rather than automated e-mail. In that way, people can have more attachment and respect to J&J. And also for J&J, it can have chance to hire talent people, so not to be scouted by others

2) If someone is very close to the ideal candidate, but lost the position due to small reason, then please explain detail for the loss so that person can try again with ambition. Otherwise, people would not know why they were not selected or whether they have another chance to J&J or not.

3) If someone has good talent but not matching to A position, then rather than informing the fail, If I were you, I would recommend him to apply to B position. so that person can have good impression to J&J and J&J needs him.

Lastly, If possible, it would be good to shorten the time for the evaluation time. sometimes, it took months and could not know whether I am in good process or I am already failed. 

Thanks for all,


"
I used to work at J&J filling in for a maternity contract.  I applied for two jobs and didn't hear back from one at all.  It would of been nice to be contacted even if I was not successful.
I understand that due to my education I was not asked to come for an interview! But when you are hiring you could consider candidates with not a very higher percentage of marks! Because not always the candidates with higher percentages are the best employees!
"I understand that a personalised responce to every applicant would be very time consuming and not practical and that only limited positions are available. To this end I am content with a generic email stating that I did not progress to the interview stage.
Though to send four emails requesting that I fill in this survey I consider as badgering and rubbing salt into the very minor wound of not being found acceptable by Johnson & Johnson. I believe you need to consider the actual benifit generated through this data acquisition against the irritation inflicted upon your applicants and how they feel about getting this survey."
"I understand it is difficult to contact all applicants, but it would be great to have some feedback on the non-selection. This will not only set J&J apart, but also help improve the process & make it more aspiring to applicants"
I thinks J&J should change the recruitment process simpler
"I think your company's recruitment process is very standard, Bingzhe fair, just and open the principle. Everyone can get the right job and I want to join your company."
"I think you must conduct a phone call interview , I've been waiting for someone to invite me or call me however i don't received any calls from you. rather that sending a email."
I think you can give more interview opportunities to fresh graduates who have little experience.
I think this process is so enough to develop a recruit system. And this step is valuable for job seekers. Thank you.
I think they should be improving on communicating with status of applicant. Sometime its take from 3 to 4 month or never feedback at all. 
I think the recruitment team of J&J can improve their hiring process by giving a reason why the applicant is rejected or why he/she is not fitted for the job. 
"I think that come back to the basic and give back an answer is the minimum. Indeed I would at least rather have a basic negative mail than nothing as it is the case now. 

The worst is that you see that the role is advertise online but you still don't have any answer on your own application..."
I think Johnson and Johnson provides a good way of recruitment process. The applicant should be patiently answering all required survey that the company needed to look for a better future employee
I think J&J shpuldnatnpeast send an email to people appk7ed for the job on whether the peopl is suitable for it so that this people can move. Better stil so e comment to improve the candidate future applications.
I Think J&J is doing good as its just like post market survey before recruitment process which give a good and dedicated candidate for the company the process is good 
"I think J&J don't review CV's very well. My experience and qualifications are of an extremely high standard and I would have expected to have an opportunity to discuss the position that did  not eventuate.

It is always interesting what calibre of person actually get short-listed recruited as I have had domestic and international experience, highly educated and worked across many industries and understand the role  backwards and forwards and cant even get an interview"
"I think it would be great if someone from the recruitment team would provide a feedback to candidates if they are shortlisted, unqualified or what not instead of sending an general automatic response. I don't know. I haven't received anything aside from this talent acquisition survey. Thank you, i appreciate your effort on getting our feedback."
I think it would be good to provide feedbacks to candidates about their interviews and explanations why they are or not a good fit for JNJ. 
"I think it can improve it's recruitment process by having a more personal approach.  I think calling to confirm receiving the e-mail, as well as asking for a personal interview would be what is expected, but if you are looking for a more creative process, through sending a video; that would entitle more effort on our side.  I think it also depends on what kind of people J&J is looking for, and maybe asking for a plan of something you expect for your recruits to do, should be executed or required of us sent to you on a certain deadline, so you actually already have something that you expect us to have, and we are somehow forced to do prior work before we earn the job. "
I think interview process is not fair.
"I think an applicant have the right to know what would be the negative feedback on them regardless if they were hired or not. In that case, an applicant will be aware and next time they will address the issue positively. "
"I texted the recruiter regarding my application status but didn't received any reply. Moving forward, the applicants would greatly appreciate it if the recruiter will provide them updates regarding their applications. If they didn't passed the interview, just tell them straight instead of letting the applicant wait for nothing."
"I suggest to acknowledge the applicant's interest for the position , and provide feedback if it was shortlisted or if JJ already hired someone for the position."
I suggest the company should give an opportunity to other subordinate country people to show their talent.
"I suggest that you response to your applicant 1-3 days to inform them about the status of their application.  

Thank you. "
I suggest that candidates should be informed the reason why they are not qualified for the position. Thank you
I suggest for you to have a email address that can deposit resume if we are not suitable for the position we have applied for.
I suggest depend upon canditate experince because some canditate have experience and some canditate fresheh but talented so experience canditate prefor 
"I submitted my application, and after receiving an auto reply message that my application was received - I did not heard from J&J again.  I tried checking my application on-line but did not see any change.  So far i did not know what's going on with my application."
"I still not seen any revert from your side regarding the Status of Applied Jobs.
This needs to be improvement. "
I still looking forward to hearing back regarding the position I applied for a month ago. I'm looking forward to hearing back soon. 
"I still do not have any interview-call received till far yet. 

I don't know, its strange!

How come this post-interview feedback form received to me though did not go through any interview for applied role/opportunity ! "
"I request the company managers to please inform about the recruitment process properly.

Thanking you
Regards"
I recommend to give a faster feedback regarding the applicant's status.
I recommend that Johnson & Johnson ensure that an email response is sent to all applicants on the status of their application. This will greatly help.
"I received back a default email which did not explain any reason why my skills set were not suitable for the role. This left a bit confused, I believe a more detailed explanation could help any candidate to improve her/his skills set in order to have a better chance for any further vacancy J&J may have."
"I received an automated message stating my application had been entered into the system and then received no communication after that.  This has happened on prior occasions as well; the lack of communication.  

If you have an inside contact at J&J it's only then are you able to get some traction and contact with the recruiter, which makes the application process irrelevant. "
"I received a mail stating that my application was missing some material. I did not apply myself, but rather was recommended by my previous manager, so I did not know exactly which material I was supposed to submit. I replied on the mail asking which material I should add, but did not receive any reply."
"I received a generic email about not being suitable for the position. This made me think that a digital sorting process had been used and my skills etc did not meet the criteria being used. 
When applying for more senior roles, a personal touch might be more professional. "
"I receive only this survey e-mail after I sent my application to company, so it would be better if you also sent response e-mail even I have not been chosen."
"I really like to work for JNJ.
However I believe my career level is not suitable for JNJ Korea.
Like to hear from JNJ Korea or other countries. 

P.S. I have submitted this survey about 3 times, however it keeps on coming to my email. "
"I really hope to join your company.
Your campany is my dream.
Thank you."
"I only received automated responses throughout the process. It would have been nice to have been contacted by someone directly regarding the position. I understand that Johnson and Johnson is a large company and receives many applications, however I feel this would have been very helpful. "
I never received feedback or an interview for the position 
I never received any communication or feedback from a recruiter therefore Im not sure why Im being asked to take a survey on the talent acquisition process. 
I never heard from a recruiter. I only received an email.
"I never had any process , I don't know why I am receiving these mails "
"I never got a reply at all from the recruiting team. If I wasn't a suitable candidate, dropping a line to say I was not right for the position would let me know where I stood. "
I never got a call from Johnson & Johnson team
I never get feedback
I never been faced any interview nor somebody had called me for interview from J&J.
I mentioned in my previous survey also. This is the only company I apply to that got back with me in no time. This is the best I have ever seen from any other company. I have applied for several of them so thank You J&J for having such a recruiting team where decisions are made and communicated this good.
"I loved talking with Lisa Arthur.  Although I was unsuccessful I am appreciative of the opportunity Lisa gave me through taking the time to understand more about what I have to offer JnJ.

I continue to hope that the right opportunity will come up for me one day at JnJ!"
"I like the feedback and survey process of J&J recruitment processes.  

I will be good that J&J can provide some feedback to non-shortlisted candidates especially those with strong profile but might not fixed to the current opening. 

It is because the candidate may want to take the opportunity to connect with J&J recruitment team for future opening.  Thus, it will be good that J&J can keep the candidate warm as the candidate may be a good fix to your future opening.

Thanks"
I know its always hard but some feed back would be great on reasons as to why you have not been chosen for a interview. 
I know it is may not always be practical (in view of the many applications) but it would really be beneficial if we are given a reason for the rejected application.
"I just send my cv for consideration. 
"
"I just have waited the feedback from your company after I applied. So if I am not proper person for this position, please let me know the result ASAP."
I just feel that this role has been appearing so many times which you means you haven't find the right candidate. The fact is there is really no perfect fit candidate and I have the relevant experience to do this job blind folded but yet I am not contacted and I really don't know what the reason is. Give candidates like me an opportunity.....this is my honest feeling....thank you for this opportunity to pen a few words.
"I interesting for this job because good product and improve the market also so if u possible please consider my CV .

thanks and regards

"I hope you have a kind of contact with candidates even only once before making a decision on the process of CV screening. It doesn't need to be a face to face meeting. You cna do it with online survey like this survey. You can see a little of deeper part of candidates about their things which you focus on.
Hope this reply helps you in anyway.
Thank you."
I hope you can match the applicant to a more suitable position in case he/she is underqualified. 
i hope you can choose someone that they dont have experience because someone who are graduating student so they dont have experience.
"I hope various experiences of a candidate can be reviewed besides on GMP experience as GMP can be learned at site bu OJT, as well."
I hope to get certain ongoing status during recruit after job-apply as I'm strongly willing to hear good news.
I hope the recruitment process will give a chance to applicants to be interviewed at least just to get a glimpse of their personality and not merely base their selections on how well their CURRICULUM VITAE has been presented.
"I hope that the company will be able to give feedback to its applicants regarding the status of their application (be it positive or negative). I view Johnson & Johnson as a company in high regards. However, as a prospective employer, it seems quite unattainable to get into the company as no feedback is being received."
"I hope that people who apply the Johnson & Johnson could find the condition of the rectuitment process, such as assessment of applicant or pass. "
"I hope that Johnson & Johnson will be able to establish an application tracking system so that applicants can clearly understand their application progress. Moreover, establishing the test procedures, which can help the applicants clearly know whether they meet the application conditions before they apply for the jobs."
"I hope that a reputed company like Johnson & Johnson have an advanced and better recruitment process.Myself wishing to be a part of this firm.Wishing you all the best,Thank you."
I hope more information or feedback that candidates could have after applying this job.
"I hope Johnson & Johnson should at least tell me the reason I am not qualified.

I havent been contacted
I haven't yet experience the recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson but I believe they have a process that is not bias.
I haven't received the interview invitation so far.
I haven't received feedback regarding my application yet
I haven't received any calls from the concern HR department except mail that my cv has been received at their end once shortlisted will get back to me.
I haven't heard from the recruiter yet.
I haven't heard anything from my applications.
I haven't gone through whole process yet. I can't recommend now. Thanks
"I haven't even went through the telephone interview due to some unknown reason. The first date I made the phone interview scheduling, so sorry I remembered the date wrong, so I missed the phone call, then I immediately reschedule a date with the interviewer, who said it's ok and gave me some available dates, then I replied a date. Then I never received any reply. After about 1 month, then I got an email from interviewer saying that missed my email, but again, no further reply or reschedule the interview afterwards. 

I understand it was my mistake to missed first scheduled interview, and I contacted with interviewer trying to make it up. Just feel so bad that Johnson&Johnson left such kind of feeling to candidates without any explanation why I was not able to reschedule a new phone interview and even the emails was ignored continuously?"
"I haven't been to interview stages of recruitment, can't really comment on that at the moment."
"I haven't been involved in the recruitment process beyond the applying stage, hence can't give substantial creative inputs for it."
I haven't been contacted regarding my application hence my ratings are all in the middle.. 
"I haven't been accepted or denied for the positions I have applied to. As a candidate, I have no clarity till now about when and how things will move forward and if they ever will.

Hoping to hear back from the recruitment team."
I have yet not received Any Call regarding Recruitment Process from J&J. 
"I have worked for J&J after graduation
from uiversitxy. I spent 12 years as a 
sales rep.
Although I produced the results, I have
no chance for getting promotion or
another experiences.
Now I am interested in finance. However
I have no chance because I lack finance
experience...
In Japan Almost New college graduates
have no experience before entering

An investment in emproyees always pays
the best interest."
"I have to say that J&J recruitment / talent acquisition team has done a great job.
Every details been express in a very good manner, and well explained.
Talents are also asked for relevant information thus made the details filling easy and straight-forward.

Well done!  "
"i have strong will to get next chance.
i want to join jj near the future.
thank you."
"I have sent several times my resume for several positions.. I didn't get any email or phone call regarding the interview.. Only they have sent is you application got rejected..How you will judge the people based on resume . Let give a chance to people who really interested..

Thanks"
I have seen most of the time applications are not selected through website and reply comes from computer atleast look in the profile of candidate and after that you can decide .
"I have seen many vacancies and applied to many suitable vacancies 
But
Nothing got reply
It's really waste of time 
At least I need to know what is happening and is my profile consider or not
Even 
I have seen many local companies where they will call or mail 
And respond 
But in J&J nothing will happen.
I have many examples about your recruitment process, I have applied for a position through J&J careers site, nothing got replied. For the same position ABM asked to join. I sent resume to ABM he referred and uploaded in J&J system, then I got interview call. 
If you consider only when internal employees referrals, why you are fooling us by telling big words like transparency and all.
We get vacancy alert mails by stating that your profile is suitable for below vacancies so sending mail. Once we apply we get reply that it's not suitable, in such case what is your measures before sending vacancies mail and reply mail.
Even I don't want to reply, but I felt it's better to share my experience so that you people came out from that fools paradise.

Again I am telling, if you really serious respond well with each applicant.

"I have received multiple invites to take this survey, yet I still haven't heard back about any IRDP application. 

It saddens me that I spent so much time on my application, and for all I know no one even read it.

It will be good to know the reason why I am not a good fit for the position."
I have not yet received any communication yet for the position that I have applied... Awaiting reply.
I have not taken part in the recruitment process. I am very eager to join. I hope I have a chance.
"I have not taken part in the recruitment process it self. I don't know how I received this mail in my inbox. However, having experience in the healthcare field, I would love to work for Johnson and Johnson, and ensure that I add to the already existing laurels of the great behemoth that J&J is."
I have not received any contact from J&J.
I have not received any communication regarding vacancy status.
i have not heard from the recruiter since i applied for the job. i am still waiting to hear from them.
"I have not heard anything directly from JnJ, apart from automated emails, regarding this or any other applications.
Frankly disappointed - actually experience was just like typical recruiter / headhunter - totally ignored.
If I am ever in the job market again, highly unlikely I would waste my time with JnJ."
I have not faced any interview for the recruitment process after applying for the position.
"I have not even been notified about my application status .
It eas totally one sided approach I have not recieved any response wheather my application was even reviewed by any one."
I have not called for interview if any requirement from me I m ready 
I have not been interviewd and still site isasking for feedback
"I have not been informed anything nor taken interview , so how I can share anything about interview process?"

"I have no idea, because I did not proceed to the recruitment process.
I just registered.

Whatever the outcome, you should give feedback to the candidate."
"I have long experience in pharma industry -17 years as Finance Manager. I can fit a lot of positions I applied, but all answers are negative. Feedback is automatic, no humane approach. I have a feeling that computer selects it."
"I have got no clearence about my status in the recruitment either i have accepted to the next process or not. So please tell us the status before you sent us the feed back form
"
I have given a telephonic interview in the month of november 2016.The person i talked told me that they will call me back for the next round interview within a week but unfortunately i have not received any call till date. My opinion to you is that please follow  a more transparent procedure in terms of recruiting any candidate. Thank you.
I have been receiving surveys but no other updates on the application. I will appreciate if application results are also communicated. Thank you!
I have been contacted twice via telephone by the same person. The phone line during the first call was so poor that I could barely hear or understand the recruiter. He did not seem to know what he was doing or what questions to ask. The call ended abruptly with the recruiter saying he was going to contact the Sydney office for feedback on a previous attempt at gaining employment with J&J last year. The second time the recruiter called me he didn't remember that he had called me less than two weeks earlier. Again the phone line was poor and echoed. The recruiter came across as not really having read my application or resume nor knew what questions he wanted to ask. I have received no further feedback relating to my application and am very disappointed and disillusioned with the whole application process and how the recruitment team handle the process. What seemed like an excellent job opportunity which I believe I could excel at has left me wondering what is expected of employees of J&J. The whole process came across as disorganized and I felt that it was impossible to progress to a face to face interview with the team in South Australia. I would have liked to have seen the facility and meet some of the team members in Adelaide.
I have apply for job before 6m month but response was to late 
"I have applied to so many supply chain / logistics / SAP IT related positions in JnJ within the last 1 year, but most of the applications were rejected by sending an automated rejection email by the HR system, this procedure need to be abandoned as it reduces the chances of selecting potentially skilled and experienced future employees. I strongly believe JnJ is an equal opportunity employer without considering a person's race, religion, ethnicity or age group. Also need to give more preference to online applications rather than entertaining job agents by HR partners in the selection process. The hiring line managers must go thru all the potential applications to see the candidates experience and functional knowledge rather than the HR person makes an initial selection process. I have an MBA (from SUNY Buffalo), an Engineering degree, SAP and supply chain certification trainings, completed lean six sigma and project management trainings, but my applications are getting rejected by JnJ HR system, this is really disappointing especially from a global MNC like JnJ! Why not give me a chance to have a face to face interview with the hiring line manager and find out my capability? Hope the HR Senior Management will look into it and correct the practices. Thank you"
"I have applied to many job openings in your esteemed organisation however I have not got any response to the applications.
I have not been given an opportunity to meet and present my profile .
I would suggest if the Recruiter informs as to why each Application is not considered.After reading the job description only I apply but still if there is no answer from your side ,it is painful.kindly send feedback."
"I have applied many time for different cross function department, however I didn't get any response from HR or recruiter for not selecting my candidature, so atleast recruiter or HR should give proper reason And area of improvement, so we can work on our strength And also I have referred my friends through Talent Acquitition for various role, they didn't get any communication from recruiter and their candidature gets rejected without their interviews . "
I have applied for vacancy.but i have not received any recruiters call or mail
"I have applied for so many positions at different point in time, however when went through the job description there was many a times disclaimer stating 'Although we have relevant people who closely match the profile we want to be fair and hence we are posting this job opportunity' this always obstructed that since you have already shortlisted the candidate, how fairly would my resume be even considered or reviewed? And it never surprised when we received rejection email as I always felt the selection procedure itself was very biased. 

With 11 years of experience in Market Research Industry your esteemed organization finds me not relevant for any openings.

Either do not post the JD's where you have already shortlisted candidate who has been selected from internal teams or if you are looking to hire someone only through employees referrals.

Secondly, if rejecting don't just drop plain rejection message, give explanations for not shortlisting the candidate.

Please do not follow policies for the sake of it. "
"I have applied for so many jobs in JnJ thru the online career portal. Most of the jobs are in the supply chain / logistics / SAP / IT areas, but most of the applications were rejected by the system (99%) even before the hiring manager go thru my CV with any interest! But I heard that JnJ Singapore is entertaining recruiting agents to send their candidates for interviews; this means online application process is useless? Only the recruiting agents having direct contact with HR partners can only secure jobs with JnJ? I am wondering why my applications are rejected even though I have 16+ years of supply chain management / Logistics / SAP (all SCM modules) experience! Also with an MBA (from SUNY Buffalo), holding a Bachelor degree in Engineering and with a Citizenship status in Singapore! My suggestion is the hiring managers should show more interest and need to o thru those relevant resumes rather than the HR staff makes a shortlisting with his / her own gut feeling! The JnJ Senior Management need to look into this matter and improve the selection process. Thank you"
I have applied for several positions with JnJ in Singapore and other countries for the supply chain / logistics / projects related positions. However I am repeatedly getting automated messages stating that my application is not successful each time! Why cant the hiring team call the candidates with right profile and experience for an interview and find out what they can deliver or find out directly on their capabilities? I am a qualified supply chain / SAP / logistics professional with 16+ years of experience and holds an MBA & Engineering degrees.I am still waiting for an interview with the direct hiring line manager after sending more than 30 applications to JnJ for the last 1 year. It looks like the direct applicants via JnJ career website is not getting interview calls when compared with candidates applying thru the career agents!
I have applied for Senior Scientist position and have not received any intimation or status of application
I have applied for multiple positions available at J&J group. Some of the rejection notification didn't mention which position the notification related to.  I hope that such notification could include the information of job title or requisition ID so that applicants can be aware which application is closed.  Thank you.

"I have a word, it is ""easy to say than to do""   The  point is ""people""  . We had different work experience in different company. It's not only A just can do A job in Johnson."

I AM SURE THAT J &J WILL CONTACT ME AND I WILL PROVE THAT I AM THE BEST FOR THIS JOB AND BAG IT."
"I had to wait for the interview about 5 to 10 mins since the interview was not ready at the appointed time (the recruiter hadn't come to office yet), but the recruiter didn't show her apology at all. Furthermore, one of the interviewers even sneaked into the room in the middle of the interview, which embarrassed  and distracted me from the meeting and it didn't seem very professional. I don't think they were fully ready for the interview at all. I doubt how they could evaluate my capabilities and potentials with that attitude in short time. It can be the first impression of the company to all job applicants, so they should be more professional and respectable at all steps of the recruitment process."
"I had requested the agency to check on the job profile thoroughly and only recommend if that is really a good fit. The recruiter told me the exact reject reason that I had as a concern before applying for it.
It may only be the recruiter, but it may be better to list out exclusion criteria,  if there is any."
I had not contacted for any kind of interview that may have happened . I just have received a mail from TA team briefing about unsuitability of my candidature .  
"I had no interaction with Johnson & Johnson management or representative.
I just received an email after several months of applying informing me that you were not going forward with my candidacy. That was it so I don't think I can evaluate your company as I did not have any interview or talk to any one."
"I had first round in Nov 2016 for DSA position 12 months contract and in late December 2016 I was informed that I have cleared first round of interview.

"I had all the skills for the position, I wasn't treated fairly and I believe this interview process was done incorrect, face to face interviews are way much better, over the phone you can only see so much. I had no chance even before I applied because he system is not fair ! absolutely annoyed "
"I had absolutely no feedback, I only received automatic emails. 

"
"I had a dream that I should join companies like GE, Ciba, Alcon, J&J. All my dreams came true except working in J&J. I am not sure though I am highly capable I am not being selected after the final rounds. 
When I apply for job through J&J no one contacts me ! 
May be it favoring Singapore Citizens only I stand a second chance being a SPR. Or is it due to internal referal selection process mostly."
"I guess j&j and should inform applicants may it be through linked in or jobstreet or whatever that application was received, and if ever that the applicant isn't fir for the job, the recruiter should inform them in a very good way. That way at least applicants wont view your company as snob or what. HR should act as human and being human is responding to queries such as application."
I got the email saying it was not a good fit within 48 hours after applying. Speed helps with expectations and moving on.
"I found out I wasn't successful from the company who did the online assessments via email, before I received an email from J&J. I would have liked to hear from J&J first."
"I felt Megan was extremely helpful and professional. The only recommendation I have is to increase the number of interviews and possibly add inn a mock day trial.

"I feel being as an MSR Johnson & Johnson dnt provide ample opportunities to reach at next level. There is no quick response from HR . Before applying this post I did apply for Metabolics DM Delhi ,
For me the interview was just a formality it took only 10 minutes of me on call. No reason , No explanation was given to me for not selecting me.

I expected to receive an email at the very least to advise that I will not be processed for the role I applied for. 
"I expect to have at least technical interview before take decision on the recruitment.

Decision has been done, just reviewing profile, doesn't seem to be right.."
I don't think so that there is any sort of improvement required because Johnson & Johnson has got the best policy in the business.
"I don't know the recruitment process in J&J.
But if I can get a opportunity to proceed a process, 
I will say it... thanks."
"I don't know if I'm considered or rejected for the position I applied for. Johnson & Johnson just emailed me about this survey without telling me first the status of my application.

So maybe my comment will be please be clear with your emails about job application status prior to let the applicants answer this survey.

Thank you."
"I don't believe your selection process is right or your ad doesn't not match your requirements. 
 I believe I had the right skill set based on the requirements. I am surprised that no one contacted me.  "
I do not think it was waisting time (I could learn a lot of thing during the process) but hiring process was too long (around 4 month). Need to be improved the quick decision. 
"I do appreciate it is difficult to individually answer why a person has not been selected and I do understand why a standard response letter is sent out.  However when you believe your fit would have been ideal, it is difficult to understand why may application wasn't progressed.
If the response was that we could not meet your salary expectation, which was my view.

I know it is difficult but do need to talk to people as that may open up more opportunities for both parties!"
"I didnt receive a response, please send a response before a survey..."
I didnt go through the recruitment process because i havent received an answer yet on my application so not sure what to suggest. 
I didn't receive any relative feedback apart from a generic email. It was very disappointing.
I didn't receive any call for Interview. I don't have any clue what's the status for the position which I have applied for. 
"i didn't got a call fro you

"I did not receive any feedback from the recruitment team.
I know i was not a good fit from this survey.

How can the recruiter decide i am not a good fit since never talked to me?

I can improve that process in a timely manner. Unfortunately I am not a good fit

Best regards"
I did not receive any communication with anyone at any stage of the recruitment process. I received and automated email to let me know my application was received and the next communication was the link to this survey some 4 months after I applied for the position. Disgusting.
"I did not receive any call or email regarding my application to Johnson & Johnson, therefore, I cannot answer these questions"
"I did not hear back from the recruiter for so long after the 1st interview even though I sent her a thankyou email right after the interview. The interview was rescheduled twice before happening, on the first time I waited for 20 mins for the call by recruiter but she/he did not call. I did not get informed about a change in schedule at all and I emailed back to someone to ask and 1 week later got a rechedule email. My interview experience was fine but I only got the result email almost 2 3 months later after that. J&J please improve on this. Thank you"
"I did not hear anything from you guys since i applied, I was confused why you sent me a survey like this which I never experience. My application from you was ignored, I never heard or contacted by you."
I did not hear anything back after an initial screening interview. It would be a huge improvement to at least be advised when unsuccessful.
I did not get the chance to be interviewed or even have a phone call to discuss the position or possible opportunities that I might be a fit.
"I did not get any reply.
and I was ordered to leave comment suddenly.
"
I did not get any rejection letter and yet from the survey it seems that I have not make the cut. It is not a nice way to convey the results of my application. Improvement should be made.
I did not get any feedback. But I always get this survey. You really need IT and the business work together. 
I did not get a mail from the talent acquisition team stating that my candidature was not suitable for the position applied.
"I could not recieve any feedback after I applied. I think that you need to be known the result at least success or failure.
However, I still love Johnson & Johnson and will try to apply to other proper position for me next. Thank you.

I cant tell because I don't get through the process.
I believe the process serves a purpose and works just fine.
i believe recruiter should inform the candidate of the status of application instead of leaving them in blank
I believe need to update opening and closing the post.
"I believe Johnson & Johnson like and stretch things on candidate resumes
To improve recruitment process, you should test the candidate, it’ll make it clear who can work under a tight deadline and who actually stands up to what the resume says."
I believe J&J has one of the best recruitment team in the land. More power!
I believe a email explaining why my profile did not fit the JD would be nice.
"I assume I didn't get the role as BDM Vision care, however I have not been advised. I think as a company as big as Johnson and Johnson, this is disgraceful. I was approached for this role by talent acquisition and was informed up until 3rd interview and then nothing. Very very disappointing, as an employee I meet deadlines and communicate with my patients and you J&J have done the complete opposite."
"I appreciate Johnson & Johnson's reply about not pursuing my candidacy. 

I understand the rationale for Johnson & Johnson not pursuing my application as  a group of candidates that more closely meets the needs of the business has been identified. That said, however, I would have loved for a chance to go through the interview process for the position which I applied for as my work background - while not directly applicable to the job scope - could add value to the organization in other ways. 

Hence, to help mitigate the feeling of regret, I would love to better understand why my qualifications were not in line with the needs of the organization. Thank you!"
"I appreciate I was not suitable for the position after no interview was held.

"I applied twice with J&J through online application but have not received any call or notice as to how am I not considered for the post. Hope I can get a feedback next time. Anyways, I still consider J&J as one of the best employers. Thanks"
"I applied through your site, so I wasn't recruited by anyone, but I thought that was a very good fit for the position. I was very surprised that I didn't even get an interview. No one contacted me to explain why. "
I applied online and did not receive any interview or next stage intimation.  Received the survey link for feedback without any interview rounds. I think its a miss!
I applied here one month ago but still not hearing anything from the company though I followed the instructions for me to be prioritized.  I would say applicants need feedback about the status of their application whether it is time to pursue to the next process or not suitable to the said position.
"I applied for this position with high hopes, but unfortunately I was never contacted by the recruitment team. Infact, months later when I applied, I just received an automated email informing that I was unsuccessful.

I believe it's a good idea to contact the candidates informing them why they were selected or not selected for further interviews. I completely understand that you must receive hundreds of applications, but given the brand name of J&J and it's marking standing among customers (who happen to be applicants also), it's not much to ask for. "
"I applied for this job a long back but im receiving the feedback now. I would appreciate, If someone can connect from your team and inform the exact feedback will be great for any candidature who is looking for the job change. "
I applied for medical representative at this company but I received no response from the company.
"I applied for another job here however I never heard from the acquisition team on how my application went. With this particular opening, I never heard anything from them. Kindly inform applicants if they are not accepted. Thank you."
I applied for a role and received an email to say I was not successful. In the mean time I have received 3 emails from you to ask me about the recruitment process. Is this not a waste of time? I have no issue at all that I did not proceed in the process but I have an issue being harassed by your emails. Seeking employment is difficult enough without emails such as these. How about spending the time with your Hr team rather than sending stupid emails to prospective employees who have made no progress in your selection process.
"I am surprised to see,  why im filling this survey when nobody from ur HR team contacted me.. That is why i rate u negative here. 
Sorry team johnson & johnson,  pls rework on ur survey. Just cross check the filters that why would you send feedbacks to a person whom u never contacted.. 
Yes i applied but never heard from u.

I am quite satisfied with the process :)) 
I am not sure if the applications received online are seriously scanned or an effort ever made to reach out to find out more on the candidate.

"I am experienced Pharma professional with Masters and Ph.D in Pharmacy, I am always applying to  jobs in J&J almost over 12 years. Still I havenot received any single chance for interview, Is this mean that my candidature is too bad that I am not even eligible for getting selected for interview.
Please help at least give me a chance for interview"
I am disappointed I was not contacted in any way regarding regarding my suitability for the role.
"I am currently in South Africa, I have been wanting to join Johnson and Johnson for a very long time and just dont see to fit the bill even though alot of my criteria is met.  How do I go about getting into JNJ as I know I will only be an asset to JNJ.

Hunt the best talent to acquire and improve the search quality.
"Human interaction , else wouldn't get right flavour of right candidate. Not sure if local talent is a paramount reason for not fit but my understanding is that for director & above jobs the companies like J&J should be above the local parameter for selection .

"HR must keep the interwiving manager informed about the canditates who he needs to interview.
Bcoz in my case the consultancy person and Hr had called me for interview 2 times but the manager was not aware and informed that he will be interviewing me too.so it was really wery insulting and bad experience reflecting JNJ and creating a bad image on my mind which i had shared with my other pharma coullegues."
"Hr is not proactive. Lazy team, rude and arrogant attitude"
Hoping that J&J would be more open with the application status and may we (Applicants) be more informed as to the progress.
hopeless
"hopefully there is a more personal communication with the aspirant employee & the company so that you can see the sincerity of the applicant in applying not only with the position applied but also see the potential may be in other position.

Hope to receive any feedback from the regional HR about whether my application is processed or not. 
Hope to get an interview opportunity as my skills and experience closely match the role applied for. I'm not sure why I'm not shortlisted. 
"Hope this will finds you in best of health.

Recruiter should invite applicant for assessment to prove their skill and passion for the posted Job. However in my case, I have been trying since long for the shift in my field where I have relevant Education and Academic experience but just CV cannot be parameter to judge the skill. Therefore I request you to call applicant to showcase their skills and passion for the work.

Looking for Positive Response"
Hope the recruiter contact and provide a reason why I were not a good fit for the position and that J&J would notify me to positions that would fit me in the future
"hope recruiter can look into my profile and advise suitable opportunity in Japan.
I am a senior IT professional with 29 years experience in Data, Enterprise, Integration and Solution architecture and I am confident my capacity fit-in blue-chip company such as J & J."
Hope J&J would provide the specific reason to applier why they could not fit for the open position. 
"Honestly, J& J emailed me that I did not make it to BOLT for Sales but no reason was given. I suspected the reason was my age because they preferred a newly grad candidate. But I still believed that if someone applied for the position is WILLING to COMMIT to the job no matter what ""working age"" he might be. "
"Honestly, 
I am about tasks.
Give me a task and allow me to shine through them, then judge me. 
Having been in business myself, I truly do not know how you can find great staff if you can not see what they are capable of. I am sure allot of good staff are identified and many are pouched from other means.

I'm not talking about self assessments. The ones that establish, what are you good at or bad at. 
C-mon who really sits down and does that?
Throw out a question and or a scenario, allow us the recruits to answer it the best way possible and pick those who meets your:
A) organisations goals  
B) The departments goals
C) Company culture?
D) The departments culture?

Take me for instance, Have been in the corporate world, jumped into another industry totally foreign and was successful for a while. Almost went bankrupt ( on my last $1000.00), hand to sell assets to stay in the game, but didn't give up. Stayed and ran with what I had and remoulded the business to gain enormous benefits for me and my family.
Does this tell you something?
Maybe not?

Anyway, good luck.

I love how your organisation reflects (through these actions/methods).

"Honestly I was disappointed that I did not even receive a phone interview and that is what influenced my opinion. 

I realize that it's a very competitive process and that there's people from universities with a better name brand.... 


but I really don't understand how I would not even receive a phone interview. I have actual job experience in Asia, am highly motivated, and sourced my own products while living in China. The grit I have cannot be explained thru a simple resume, but your recruiters won't get a chance to see what without speaking to me. "
"Hire me to advise and provide a much better engagement and recruitment experience, you have missed out on a very diverse talent that would have taken ownership of this role and taken it to a new level.

if somebody applies as a product manager for Johnson & Johnson, he will have definite ideas for increasing sale and research for product development.

I think i am fit for this position so i one face to face interview should be done with me and with every person who is applying for this post because without taking interview of first phase it would be too much difficult to say that candidate is not fit.

"Dear Sir/Madam,

Quick summary on my background.  I have been in the IT industry for over 25 years, and engaged in the areas of IT service management, system integration, and consulting for large multinational companies and industries.  I can leverage on my extensive IT experience to contribute and value add to an organization such as J&J. However ...

I am writing to express my disappointment in the poor communication I endured via J&J recruitment process in Asia. After numerous attempts (over half dozen) applying for opportunities in Singapore and taking numerous online assessment tests, NOT one courtesy phone call from any of J&J recruiters on why my background was not a good fit nor status of my application. Only communication was a standardized form rejection letter sent via email many months after the initial application.  In short, my poor survey feedback reflects my frustration with J&J talent acquisition team and recruitment process.

Thanks"
"Dear Sir/Madam,

I believe the recruiter should spend at least 2 mins to understand the person caliber and at least speak to the candidate. in my 21 years of working I have recruited over 80 staff and interviewed over 500 candidates, my experience has taught me to look beyond resume to get the right candidate. In fact I got bright talent whose resume was totally misfit for the position he applied for.

PS : I understand the application volume is high but sometimes going beyond the resume will help the company in getting the right recruitment.

"Dear Sir, 
With due respect this is to state that the recruitment process of Johnson & Johnson is absolutely transparent, methodical and talent oriented. 
Honestly, I am no where  on that position to give the improvement suggestion to the authority. 
But as you are asking my opinion regarding the same, one question is arising in my mind,... Before to eliminate some one on the basis of his CV may we go through one telephonic round..??? Because, I strongly  believe that only CV cannot describe one candidate's talent. It only describes his achievements, his past not the future. Sometimes it matches with your desired candidate sometimes not. My question is how you can judge a person's talent by just viewing his /her CV or asking some common questions through mail...??? It might be possible that person is extremely talented and can be the right fit for your organization but due to any reason so far he/she has not get the right opportunity to show talent...!!!!

"Dear Sir,
J&J is a well known Multi National organization in the Pharmaceutical industry and producing affordable medicines to the humans with innovations. This makes me apply for the above position and give the score of 8/9 for Q3 & Q5.

From my experience I heard and witnessed that, candidate success rate is very very low those are applied through J&J web portal. It’s only my opinion and experience gained within the pharmaceutical professional network in India, China, Malaysia and Singapore. 

Following are my suggestions :

1.	The candidate use to receive an auto generated e-mail immediately after applying the designated position, but I also feel that another update (via call/e-mail) can be given to the candidate if the candidate profile is not suitable for the position with general reasons. So that candidate to put at ease of anticipation.
2.	During new Position postings, a few lines can be added regarding the Nationality or VISA requirements or Sponsorship.

Thanks for taking the feed back

"Dear Sir,
At the very outset I  thank you for giving me an opportunity to provide feed-back for the TA process.  This process of seeking feedback from candidates itself is a big example of high standard of integrity and professionalism adhered to by J&J. I really appreciate the same. 

The whole process of Talent Acquisition was quick, flawless and transparent. 
 
 I have a small suggestion to make based on my experience ,as my candidature evaluation was entirely based on telephonic conversations from India and Belgium.
 I am of the view that face to face or video conference/ skype calls  is a  better method to conduct  interview if the interviewer and the candidates are from different continents having different phonetics.  I learnt this from my  experience of negotiating contracts with many western  clients and law firms.

 I was not able to demonstrate my skills and competencies over telephone effectively due to lag in voice during call.  If this interview was on video conference or face to face, I am sure I would have  definitely grabbed this opportunity.  Hence  I requested for an appointment for  face to face meeting with the interviewer during my personal visit to Singapore.  However it was late …

I really appreciate you taking the time to consider me for the position and if any other vacancy were to become available, I would love to have the opportunity to apply.

Thanks again for your time. I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely
Binu

"Dear Sir,

I am working as an ABM for almost 6 years now. But joing to marketing was my dream. I had discussed several times at all levels in hierarchy but nothing has been done. No initiative taken. No develpmental plan done. No project given. No SWAT analysis planned or discussed. I do applied for the responsiblity of - Senior Product Manager - Metabolics (1600134623W).

But post that I have never been contacted nor informed . I dont know why I am miss fit for the position. More over I dont know how to develop my self so that I can get the opportunity in future. 

Not at all happy with the process. 

I have joined JnJ in Nov 2014. Till date no careeer development discussion have done. No clear cut process were discussed for higher responsibilities . "

"Dear Reader,
I am very well aware of the fact that these days its very hard to be a part of a reputed company such as yours. I have applied here as a Research Associate multiple times and unfortunately, did not make it. It would be great if I come to know about the reasons for the same and what shall I do to overcome this situation. As a matter of fact, I believe, I am a well versed with the biochemistry, molecular and cell biology techniques and also I have transferable skill set that I have acquired since past 10 years or so. I can learn new things in a short span of time and I have the intention to make a dent in the universe. So kindly see to it.

Current recruitment process is very much depend on Resume & online details shown by candidates. The details are often over shown by candidates but practically they are not sound. So i have a suggestion to give maximum chance for candidates to attend interview & to show their capability & talents.

Could have been faster.

Mostly we look at the responsibilities and qualifications and mostly which industry we come from. But for SCM roles, it does not matter from which industry you come from, the terminology might be different , but the process is the same. Its vital that we communicate to understand the candidate better.  "
At very least return phone calls.
"At present Johnson & Johnson's, process for recruitment seems to be best, & as a candidate i would like to say, candidates should know in either case if he/she gets selected/ not get selected or move further in rounds of interview, the highlighting points behind both the cases by email or any other mode of communicaton because this helps every candidate to realise their own strengths they showed to recruiter or what they neede to showcase during opprtunity they have/had with them. this will be win-win situation for mankind for whom every healthcare or pharmaceuticals work towards."
At most is just a mention that the candidate is not suitable.  However i can't rate 3 and 5 (so it neutral score) as I personally did not feel great in the recruitment process.  One thing I realize is that pharma companies tend to sway towards candidates in the same industry and totally ignore candidates from other industries. The think out of the box for candidate selection is not in the selection DNA.  Thank you for listening.

Asked to participate in this talent recruitment survey without once having been contacted to be told I had been accepted or not. Very strange system and quite frankly weird not having been contacted previously at all.
"As your first question said- ""Did the recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to""?

- It would be great to know if one could provide a reason."
as they are having god process. and i would like to suggest to have one exam online before the resume upload so that you get right candidate
"As stated in question number one, I believe that your recruitment team should inform the applicant if he or she is qualified for the position he is applying for.  Informing applicants of the result of his application shows that you deal with candidates in a professional manner and as a responsible organization as a whole."
"As people come and go. J&J can take the advantage of the potential candidate who applied for the current or to be open position to minimize the duration of hiring. For instance, if J&J need to hire for an admin position, on top of advertise the admin position, it can also advertise tolook for admin plus account, admin plus finance and admin plus HR. Next J&J could also send out a survey to evaluate applied candidates totest their suitability for certain position from time totime when the position need to be fill one day. "
"As of now, in my opinion the recruitment process is better than most of the top companies in the world. But nothing is perfect and J & J has to keep updating itself with the competitors. "
"As of Now I have given any interview, or not received any call from J&J. SO unable to say in this regard."
"As in my case no any specific reason suggested for rejection.
It will be most welcome if reverted so to work on rejection points."
"As I applied for a very specialized role and have directly relevant experience in the pharmaceutical industry, I think J&J should at least interview me to afford me a chance to show how I can make a significant, positive difference and be a valuable asset to the company."
"As I applied directly via system (not via a search firm) I did not have enough information about the postion and about the recruting process at all. 
So I have asked a couple of questions after receiving an interview invitation regarding the process to the recruiter throuth email but she never replied even if I sent her reminders several times. She did not even pick up my phone call and finally after I called the reception I could get an answer from her. and she was very abrupt all the time. (the interviewer was very nice)
As a person who does HR as well, I was deaply disappointed at your process and how you treat your candidates. I did not want to work at a place that HR is not professional at all."
"As an internal applicant, there was no update from HR or whoever after application was submitted. After several weeks I asked HR, got standard reply ""in review process"". And then the next email I got was a systematic rejection. In the end I only got a feedback phone call until my manager helped me raise the disatification to Singapore. 

It was an experience that I just felt like I was one of the external applicants, although I've been hearing internally JNJ is trying to promote job transfer within the big family. "
"As an employer seeking for future employee, a candidate must get feedback about the suitability of his candidature. Or else he must be informed about the qualifications you are looking for. So that either he will develop the same or else could discide his way to seeking other opportunities.
Thanks.... Would be keen to be a part of such an elite organisation."
"As an applicant, I feel like my application was not given value. Although I have received an electronic email rejection, but there was no clear reason or explanation why I did not fit the requirements or if there are other opportunities that can fit my skill set. Feedback is a gift. How else can one improve without any helpful feedback? "
"As an applicant I did not find any difficulties in your application procedures. Maybe in the future if I will have an opportunity to become one of your employees, then I maybe able to check if there is a problem. Thanks and more power to you!"
"As after I applied for position, I got call from Hr only, that to take some of my details, but after that there was absolutely no contact, I expected atleast a call to let know that if i am not fit for position and a reason for that! I am till absolutely clueless about furthur proceedings.
Please provide a mail or a call to clarify the things, to pepole who have applied for internal positions, that would be a request."
"As above, advise on role. Previously spoken to recruitment person. I am most interested in a role with Johnson & Johnson. Sonya K"
"As a suggestion i would suggest give chance to young brains as they are fresh they feel easy to relocate ,gain talents and execute more to the company benefits. It also benefits the young generation and also develops new ideas from the employees for the development of the company."
As a fresher who apply for job and meets the criteria should be given at least a chance to show his / her skill irrespective of visa status.
"Arrange an interview for experienced candidate to understand how his related experience able to help the company benefits and achieve KPI

apart from this type of survey you people just go through the resumes and if any profile suits to your requirement you call them no need of this type of surveys.
"Any selection should be based on experience of that candidate in a respective field and not through your process. Process should come afterwards. Atleast  a candidate should be called upon or discussed over phone to access their experience and capabilities. Being a reputed company like you should give preference , respect and importance to the candidate who has good experience and experience person should always being taken an interview before saying ""NO""
Secondly the basic qualification of any post should be very specific and if any candidate is close to it should be called or taken an interview"
Another unresponsive potential employer that does not consider a qualified candidate
"Ankita hr is stupid person , she don't selected me because iam ambitious "
An online hiring process flow/ or tracking where applicant can monitor his application status will be great. Providing updates or notice as to why an applicant is not a good fit for the position is a  cutting- edge and Johnson & Johnson hallmark as  an industry leader.
An email regarding the status of application whether or not there had been any updates would be appreciated.
An email giving info that you weren't accepted could have made it better.
"Although johnson & johnson is a very prominent company, it saddens me that the hiring process didn't even give a chance to express how suitable the candidate is for the job.
"
"Although it might be very difficult given the number of Job applications the HR department must be getting on a daily basis, but it would be a little nice to know if the candidate has been shortlisted or not. 

GOOD DAY!!"
Also consider pharma professional persons for fmcg 
Already it's different from others.
"Allow me to take this evaluation frankly. I personally like to work at Johnson and Johnson alot, without recruiter influence, I would have rate the company to highly favourable ( 8-9) 

Upon this position, I didn't get any feedback at all. However as another position in which I have been invited for the interview, the recruiter was not punctual at all. 

Example Case: 

- She told me she would let me know the result by Friday, but no results were inform until the following Tuesday. ( I called her on that Friday but she say it's still on process) 

- She told me that my available timeline didn't fit, so I offered her some other alternatives as I'm still on my last semester. Thus she said she will contact me back in few minutes but it actually took her almost a week. ( This time I didn't call back.) 

Please do take this feedback as an issue to improve rather than negative words towards your company. 

Thank you,
Best Regards. "

"After my initial interview, I was asked to wait for further instructions. I waited three hours (7pm to 10pm) and have not received any information/intructions. I was supposed to leave after the first hour but the reception guard would not let me go out because he said I have to wait for the instructions. I asked the guard to look for my first interviewer or the HR personnel if I can go home.  The guard returned and said that my interviewer is in a meeting. For the next 2 hours, I kept asking the guard to assist me. I also tried to call the HR personnel, JF Sta. Ana, but I have received any reply. So at around 10pm, the guard finally returned and said that my  next interview was cancelled. He also extended apology from my initial interviewer, Ms. Lorraine Domingo. I believe that job applicants should be treated with utmost professionalism which is the same expectation the company has from their job applicants. Maybe my case was not common but I would have appreciated it if I immediately received feedback that I did not make it, instead of waiting for three hours for nothing. "
"After more than 3 months, I never received any feedback on my application. Not even an automated E-Mail, which lets me know that my application is not further processed. Having taken the time applying for a position at your company now feels like wasted. I hope this survey might help by improving the recruitment process."
"After having 41 years' professional career, I applied for several positions in QA/RA but all my applications were turned down which is disappointing because I want to establish my career with J&J and contribute my 4-decade long diversified expertise and experience to QA/RA departments."
after getting evaluated i will be in a position to provide feedback
After being a part of Johnson & Johnson's community they should update us for new requirement.
After applying they can directly contact that regarding the vacancy as your cv is shortlisted or not shortlisted.
After applying there is no way to view at what level it got stucked.Is the vacancy fulfilled or still there is a vacancy - there is no way of finding out.
"After applying the job, I have not received any communication. from the recruiter. "
After applying first discuss and make clear regarding positions and then forward a mail reply.
Advise why the candidate did not measure up in regard to the key result areas of the role in question
"Adding to your talent pool
Capability Testing to be done
Research tasks to be given on work experiance"
Add More Detail to Your Job Posting
"Actually, I did not get any reply from you at all. I just have survey request. 
and the questions are so wired because i did not get any contact from recruiter after i apply. "
Actually try to personally respond to inquiries.
"Actually I have applied several positions in J&J, however I just receive one formal reply that I am not fit the requirements, so I don't know whether I am rejected in other positions. It is better to reply the applicant faster and even when he is rejected. "
Actually contact the prospective candidate.
Actually contact me.
Actually call me and talk to me in person/over the phone.  
"According to me, this online recruitment process has no use, I applied for different post with required criteria from last 6 months but they didnt give any reply. (at least rejection of resume). I dont know talent requestion team see this online portal or not. I did specialization in Medical devices and applied for the same post, instead of specialize candidate in this field, Actually less educated people are working in this company. So its my kind request to you please not only sent reply for just conformation of applied post but also with reason informe about why your application not accepted.

Thanking you,
Rashtrapal Zine, (M.S. Pharm)

According to me this selection process is  too lengthy.This is what can be done.
"According to me Johnson & Johnson is one of the best Company . They are doing well they don't need to improve the recruitment process.  My  best wishes are with them.

I hope to get job offer from you.."
According to different countries and regions adopt different recruitment process and language.
Accelerate the process in terms of time and analysis of the applicant to provide them a complete feedback about their skills and experience for the open executive position.
"Abrir mais vagas de estagios !

"Above all, I really like Johnson & Johnson's products. Because of that I hope to become a your worker as soon as possible. Just one thing I want is, if you inform me my current application status promptly, I will be thankful."
"about internship...

internship is related with job offer?"
A timely follow up is what all candidates look for. Not receiving any feedback for months / ignored is the worst in the recruitment process. Disappointed for such company like J&J.
A response by email to confirm unsuccessful applications would have changed how I view the Johnson & Johnson recruitment process. It doesn't take much effort to send an email.
A proper interview process with the candidatures previous experience with  knowledge in their field  & proper clearance on their subject could be the best person for the job employment
A precise reason why you weren't picked as a likely candidate would be appreciated. The reviews by Johnson and Johnson from employees and its reputation as a high quality product that has served families and household for generations are reasons why I patronize the product and want to be member of the team and company
A phone call would be great. Follow up are very disconnected for the roles applied for.
A more solid reasoning on declining application. 
A more human touch would be nice
"A feedback for an application, whether it's positive or negative should be given to applicant."
A courtesy email/ phone call to acknowledge your application/progression or at least a thank you for applying you were not successful at this time.
"A clear message that I am not further considered for the position I applied for was not provided. Furthermore, a reason why I am not a good fit for the position I applied for would be appreciated."
"A brief statement as to why the candidate is not suitable for a particular position.
Eg, Does not meet the academic requirements or lacking of experience in certain function etc.

Was not satisfied with the HR recruiters unhelpfulness in some situations. 
I would like to say that if the HR recruiter is out, it would be nice to actually have another email address to be forwarded to so that I would be able to get some answers regardless of the HR talent teams ailments. I was really never on the front foot because I didn't have a single clue about the role I was going for save for it was a contract (No position description outlining anything EVEN in the confirmation email). This to me is not a professional manner in setting up the interview as :
a) the position may already have expired on the J&J talent board so its hard to find the description if it was advertised
b) does not give any insight as to % of work dedicated to each task
c) creates confusion for the interviewee.

 I would suggest recruitment team shouldnt have just emphasize on education level during their hiring process. They also can consider or give chance to those who have working experiences than insists on hiring degree holder only ! :)
 I think they can always update the application status of their applicants.
 Employee more  diversity
 By any parichay policy or any refference.

 a feedback on applicants will be very much appreciated whether qualified or not. and it will be nice if HR will not be discriminative of applicants profile.

Я очень хочу присоединиться к вашей команде и стать отличным продажником
хотелось бы чтоб во время собеседования более конкретно дали понять чего компания хочет от медицинского представителя. какие конкретно задачи ставит компания перед медицинским представителем. 
Улучшить обратную связь с кандидатами. 
Русский язык
Предоставлять оперативную обратную связь на всех этапах найма.
Нанимать более вежливых рекрутеров.
Давать качественную обратную связь письменно так и устно.
Взять меня на работу медицинским представителем.
Zeitnah Rückmeldung geben - auch auf Nachfrage habe ich keine Antwort erhalten. Die finale Absage kam nach drei Monaten.
Yuzyuze gorusmeleri arttirabilir
your recruitment process is high minded it's O.K.
"Your recruiters need to be available. It took more than 2 months and an e-mail to the whole recruitment department before the recruiter replied to my (within the company) e-mails. Furthermore she was very hard to reach throughout the process. When I confronted her with this, she replied that she is always very busy and does not want to work extra hours to read her e-mails. I think that this is a weird response and a weird excuse to not answer your e-mail. I liked the way the interview was conducted. I worked for Janssen before and I would still be glad to work for the company in the future, but my rating for the company is a 7, because of the bad communication of the recruiter."
Your process is robotic and kicks out worthy candidates with out any explanation. 
"Your logical test are too easy and insulting to my intelligence. To be honest and fair, ALL recruitment logical test are like that ! Change something that will make you stand out from the average employer."
"your job titles seems not to be clear. a Specialist in french is highly educated with around 10 years of experience. for Johnson it seems to be a junior Position. 
I hope this would help"
"your job titles are not easily understantable, regarding to responsibilities of the jobs. Mayb more explanations would help"
"Your hr contacted me once to ask me about my salary expectation and i never heard from her since then. An answer, positive or negative would have been nice."
"You should take interviews for candidates having good experience in same field. I am having good experience in supply chain that's why I have applied in your organization and I got reply that hiring team has not chosen. So during interviews only you will get to know candidate's skills, experience, strength etc."
"You should simplify the first step of application.
It's difficult for me to understand why do you need so detailed information about the person you will not cooperate with. Those details should be requested only if you decide to hire a person. Otherwise you collect a lot of info about a candidate and it's very hard to understand what you will use it for if you are not going to invite this person even for the short talk/interview. "
"You should practice equal opportunity employer , selection process should be based on merit not on approach ."
"You should look for a candidate widely, taking into account his professional experience as a whole.
Feedback is always important!"
You should just inform about result of process. 
"you should inform the candidate ,why didnt  selected "
"you should inform the applicant about the reasons for not taking the position 
you should encourage the applicant to apply for the vacancies applied by the recruiter"
You should have a closer relation with your candidates so they feel appreciated
You should give a feedback about the current application status. Furthermorel a phonenumer or email address for further inquiries would be helpful. But most important you should give a feedback if the application is accepted or declined! 
"You should give a chance to all qualified applicants.
For example I have no FMCG experience but I have marketing, corporate communication, event experiences which I can apply these competencies in any company and sector. 
"
You should explain the reason why you do not select a candidate
"You should contact everyone who gives you the time to complete an application form for  a job and give them a reason why they have been turned down for the position to enable them to change the way they go about trying to get employment for the future. Also this gives you the chance to reaccess the candidate on the chance you are letting a good future employee slip through the system. There probably many genuine applications that don't get through the process that are a lot better than the ones that do. E.g. myself who is fed up of travelling to Dublin every week for work and wants to work in Limerick to be with his wife and two children who will give 100% commitment  to the job I send an application too. 
Thanks for your time. 
Regards 
James Shippam."
"You should contact each person who applies and provide a reason why he wasnot a good fit for the position he applied to. Only with a strucured feedback people can understand which skills/metodolgies/elements improve to be part of Johnson & Johnson. 
Actually it seems you don't check job applications because you already know the right ""suggested"" person  (maybe a consultant that was working for J&J) whom the job vacancy was created for..........."
"You should be aware that only highly talented, highly motivated, highly energized and highly innovotive  knowledge workers apply for such positions. These people chose J&J because they see a fit between their unique skills and the need of J&J to innovate. People like me (Ph.D., MA, MBA) extensive track record in Life Science, Innovation, Project Management, Communication would love to work for J&J, but if not even a decent email on the status of the application, a nice discussion with a recruiter, or at least an opportunity to describe one's talent is given, these innovative people will lose any interest in working for J&J. Moreover, when the only interaction with J&J is to help them fill out statistics. "
"You placed job alert in several places - it doesn't work  from my point of view- focus is lost - very wide. I have to visit all these sites and I never can understand Did I apply or no- because I never get feedback about my results.

Process is unclear I am sure that candidates haven""t equality - I know that HR in Russia can delete strong candidate and hire relatives or bribery influenced candidate ( it is our culture). So I recommend  to hire best candidates with online tests - professional or psychological. It is clear and it is work!!!"
You never call me or contact
"You need to sort out the apparent gap between jobs.jnj.com and jnjc.taleo.net. Why are documents that I upload via jobs.jnj.com not available to the HR representatives in your Janssen department in Schaffhausen, Switzerland?"
"You need to give chance to ppl.who apply even without work experience, you never meet them or talk with them, so you don't really know the knoweleg or maybe they are smarter and fast learners.Better invite all ppl who apply for the job you offer and have conversation with them and then chose who go further.Not only you send email that the team didn't chose etc. Never judge a book by it's cover"
You need to address the profile strength or weakness and the relative decisions that results in hiring or non hiring a candidate 
You might want to look more for 50 year olds with highly skilled and experienced
you might want to actually contact your applicants.... do some real work and get off your ass....
You know what you have to do. Allow more time for the HR professionals complete the process and not just send automated letters. I know time is money and you want keep your ISO's with all these survey shit!
You have to proceed yoour process to understand your candidate's abilities. Also they have to be an objective.
you have to give the possibility of job evryone
you have to give people the reason why you didn't choose or contact them  because if no reasons so it means that all of these ads are fake and the one who will be recruited is already none or as we know in middle east it is based on your connection and not on your capabilities 
You have to change the attitude 
You have to be more responsible (take ASAP feedback and endure the term of each stage of assessment)
You have to answer quickly
"You have replied to my application with almost one sentence email and with no explanation/reason. Then you spammed my mailbox with survey.

This is not professional at all.

"You have not told me absolutely anything in the past 3 months.

"You did not give any reasons why I am not a good match for the job. Actually, I have the all the qualifications you gave in the job description. "
You did not contact me at any point of the process except the invitation fot the survey. Thats highly unproffesional and made me look at your company in a totally different perspective. You have to fix that or youre gonna loose not only potential employees but also clients. Regards.
"You could/should give some kind of information, on why people are not selected for the job they applied for."
You could tell the candidate that they have not been selected for follow any follow up interviews before sending out a questionnaire asking them to review their now obviously failed attempt to join the company
you could make the application process more user friendly
You could introduce into survey questions better suited to the role for which a person is a candidate

Wish me better luck in future recruitment processes :) 
Why should i recommend a company where i never have worked in and that doesn't believe in me? 
"Why does J&J send me feedback requests when they don't invite me to an interview in the first place ?
I am quite tired of the big companies' recruiting portals in general. I'll soon stop using them and purely rely on networking.
I don't know if you have other alternatives but I am quite frustrated.
Best regards."
Why bother your just going to hit ITLDPs
"Why are you sending the survey questions out to the people which have no iteration with recruiting process beside applying for an open position?

And one remark to first question. If an automated email with information that your application was not selected is consider a recruiter response than probably the recruitment process is not as it should be."
While I understand that there is a sensitivity it would be useful to get more detailed or specific feedback in particular when applicants are senior.  
"Where possible due to the volume of applications one may assume are submitted for roles, specific in lieu of generic (…we have  identified a group of candidates that more closely meets the needs of the business…) automated feedback regarding suitability would be beneficial in instances when an application is not processed further as this will enable applicants to assess roles and requirements more critically prior to applying and benefit both the applicant and Johnson & Johnson. Aside from that I would not hesitate in recommending the organisation to anyone as I have a great deal of respect for the business."
"Whenever J&J rejects a candidate they shall inform them in person (via e-mail) the detailed reason behind such rejection, equal treatment means the company respects the candidate with same level as the opposite case."
when you have some potential talent that knocks at your doorstep at least giving 5 to 10 minutes of your recruiting time to speak directly to the person like you will do during a networking session then you will be able to gauge if you have to proceed to pursue by setting up a formal interview.
When you come from a german Server - an automatic reconnect to the German recruting Site - also better viewable steps in progress and a simpler upload of documents
"When you are planning to hire internally, dont open the position to the public "
"When we are applying for a position in an extremely reputed firm like J&J,it means a life to us.it is really depressive when you get to know that you are being rejected by the inefficiency of two sheets of paper. please do not evaluate the efficiency or worthiness  of an applicant by just screening a resume.please do find a better recruitment process to confirm the talents are joined with J&J.

When they regret the candidates they should call them and let the telephon interview decide
"When there is 5 woman and 20 men which some of them are better.. stop looking at equaliy and hire 5 woman who don't know what is Java. I know a lot of people from JJ which because of that are already looking for other job. 
"
When the hiring team choose not to pursue our candidacy for the applied position they should provide a reason why we were not a good fit. This would be very helpful for further candidacies
"When J&J decides to reject candidacy it would be nice to write why. I'm aware you don't have to do that, but to change smth, person needs to know whats wrong."
When I apply for a position - I check carefully in advance that my profile fits very well. The feedback to my application was not clear to me. I would appreciate more specific feedback.   
"When I applied for a job as a Production technician did not got any reply back from the company. 
My brother had interview with this company never got the assessment that mean makes people full the told him you will get the assessment with 2 to 3 days .so he went to a open day the was showing the company and the machines  and told him and 20 people that get assessment with 2 to 3 days unfortunately no one got the assessment. Make people feel like I maybe have a chance to get a job but the company makes people full .when job comes up the only gets the job who is already in the company. Perhaps not recommend this company to no one ."
"When I applied a few weeks ago, the recruitment website probably had problems to load, and it was not intuitive at all (seemed to be a really old website). But this issue must to be solved as I do not encounter the same problem today."
"When I  have a view on my experience, and compare the other , I have the largest, and never J&J contacted me , because I 'm 58 years old, only for this reason!"
"When experienced hires apply for advertised roles, I believe that it would be useful to provide some form of feedback as to why they were not shortlisted for interview particularly when their skill set matched the role profile.
It should not take the recruiter very long and it allows to candidate to understand exactly the type of candidate J&J are looking for.
I also believe that this level of feedback will allow your recruiters to write better job specs in order that candidates that are either under or over qualified can see this prior to making an application."
"When creating your job profile, the same questions are asked again and again. This doesn't make any sense and is annoying.
I haven't had any contact with a person, i.e. everything was handled purely over the automated system."
"when completing the application there should be an option to save and come back to the questions, as it can be difficult to prepare questions and complete the application in a single sitting. Also more informative feedback would be useful in response to not furthering the application."
"When calling for second round interviews and an invitation is sent out incorrectly, just a recall on the email is not sufficient."
"When applying to the position I entered my profile information and attached a resume , thereafter I received an automated message which indeed had a nice and kind content. However that automated message did not tell any about the further process . 18 days after the first automated message I received another message telling that the hiring team chose not to pursue my candidacy . This second message did not specify any reasons. I would wish the first (automated) message to provide some information as to the further process after filing application and also  the second message to specify a reason .

"When applying for advertised roles on the web, there's no recruiter involved... hence very little is provided other than email acknowledgement of an application and indeed an email confirmation of rejection - no reasons, no interview..."
"When  sending an e-mail to candidates informing them that they have not been chosen for an interview it would be good to offer them the chance to ask feedback about why it was felt they were not a good fit for the position they applied for.

"What's the point of asking such questions when you cannot even demonstrate transparency that you actually acted on any such feedback. Can you also prove that your recruitment process is not a victim of ""clanish"" mentality?"
"what recruitment process?
in my case i was called by the recruiter without ""pre-warning"" and immediately underwent a phone interview that lasted 45min. flexibility is not an issue for me, but planning and management of expectations is important. after that interview no further reaction/feedback or contact by J&J. 
first contact after the unplanned phone interview was this email, asking for feedback about the recruitment process. 
honestly, this is very poorly managed and as an HR professional I can only hope that in my case, this experience was an exception. "
Well.. have been told to be in a second interview. Email arrived not for anything further up. Interviewer seemed less interest in interviewee. Sorry. Not again for Johnson. 
"Well,it is kind of difficult to answer that question because i have never had the chance to be recruited by Johnson and Johnson,but in order to fix up that problem,i would be very happy to get  an appointment with you, so as to be able to explain my motivation and competence as a pharmaceutical representative.

Truly yours

"Well,I see there are lot of surveys involved in the recruitment process which might be  favourable to the J & J community before even recruiting the candidate.That's something unique and different.

With reference to my candidature,I have an UAE exp of 10yrs in Supply Chain Logistics with reputed companies, but still I have not receive a single call.I appreciate if i could get an opportunity to speak to an recruiter.I believe in J & J HR 's talented potential team and wish dream to work for J & J one fine day. "
"Well, I was eliminated at the first step therefore I do not have enough knowledge regarding the process. Still, this is the fourth time I am receiving the request for an evaluation of the recruitment process e-mail. "
"Well, I don't think that it's okay for a big company like j&j to send a rejection letter from stock without making a difference between the positions which were applied for. If someone was really interested in recruiting people with j&j dna than this person should've taken more than just a second to examine my application because I took the time to gather all the information about j&j, evaluated if values are congruent and wrote an unique application just for j&j. So I think it would be fair if this was appreciated a little more. Maybe there is another position that suits me more within the company or giving a hint about what really were the reasons for the rejection could've helped me more and made me feel better 
"
"Well, I am not an expert but to my view recruitment process should be more interactive. Recruitment team should inform the applicants for their rejection or acceptance of candidature with reasons so that it will help them to understand where they are actually lacking.

I hope your team will take this suggestion in a positive way.

Warm Regards
"
well i was not invited for any interview !
Well I suppose give me the interview first.??? I have never received an interview from Johnson & Johnson. In fact I only received an Email informing me I wasn't suitable for the position. Then I receive this request looking for me to complete this survey.? Needless to say I am somewhat confused.  
We should send any feedback either qualified to do an interview or not via mail or any one contact me instead of no one call me till now
We do not received any feedback immediately.
"Wasn't made aware if I was successful or not until this survey, should have better communication"
Was never contacted after application was submitted. 
Want to be part of J&J at the earliest..
"Waiting more than 2 months to revive some feedback is a poor performance 
Luckily I have not waited all this time ;)"

Voir et lire pour bien le curriculum vitae et non l'age de la personne. 
Very very slow process. And no feedback nor news at all. Application portal feels also so outdated...
Very unpersonalised response with no feedback given as to why I was not suitable. Very disappointing
Very simple but effective improvement is to provide feedback to candidates who are not selected 
"Very poorly handled no feedback and massive delays and then told I had progressed to interview to then 4 weeks later without a word find out that the job had been offered elsewhere

Personally it contributed to me resigning from my current role as gave me real concerns about my future progression with JNJ"
"Very good question.
If you proceed to do the recruitment process like today, J&J will going to miss more and more very good profiles.
No contact, no reason, it's very contra-person.
When you want to attract good talents, please review your complete recruitment process.
If you wish I can establish a very good approach of recruitment for J&J.
Interested?

"use one system, depending on the page you come from you are linked to two different databases; when applying for more than one job it is uncomfortable that you cannot upload documents for only this job, old fields/data is being overwritten when applying for another job (it changes data entered into the first application as well which does not fit then)"
use feedback 
Update their the applicant's profile with real-time information about the position they applied for. Provide better feedback and a more user friendly sign-in page
Update the applicants what available in the company or more information 
Update me on recruitment decision
"up-date on recruitment process after interview took more than 4 weeks, allthough update was reqeuested before. Should be much shorter.

I personnally would appreciate a timeline in the job ad until when it is open for application. (this is not common in Austria)"
"Unfortunately, the role I applied for was put on hold.  

It was naturally disappointing to find this out at the end of the interview process, which consisted of: an initial telephone interview, a series of psychometric and mathematical online tests, a presentation of a case-study under timed conditions with a face to face interview with the UK & US, and a telephone interview with the US after 2 previously failed attempts waiting online for my interviewer to join the call (due to issues with internal communication). 

However, I had a very helpful follow-up call from the hiring manager and I fully understand and appreciate the circumstances that led to the role being put on hold. I still hold JnJ in very high regard and respect the decisions made. I would definitely recommend JnJ to others and would welcome the opportunity to join the company in the future."
"Unfortunately, I have never been contacted by a recruiter and I cannot provide an opinion about the recruitment process. "
"Unfortunately, I had a very poor experience. I did not receive any feedback whatsoever as to why I was not a good fit despite my requesting. I was so curious that I applied directly again just to see what the feedback might be. Interestingly, this time I did get a response from J&J directly saying that there were other candidates that were a better fit, you did not provide any further reason. Interestingly, my direct report at my current company in Heinz said that he was approached directly for this position. I then assumed that the reason I was probably not a good fit was because this role was too junior for me. Even more curiously, another colleague at Heinz who works at my level as a Senior Category Manager (we have very similar level of experience both in terms of number of years and the portfolio of businesses we have worked for) said she was contacted for the same position at J&J. This left me even more confused. As you can see, in the absence of any credible explanation as to why I was not a good fit, and with the information that 2 of my colleagues had been directly approached (one junior to me and another at my level) by J&J, I was left with an horrible suspicion if there was in discrimination at play? I would hate to think so, but you can appreciate why one can come to such a conclusion. I fully understand that it is not the prospective employers obligation to fully explain why a prospective candidate might not be a good fit. Even so, it is incumbent on both the prospective employer and employee to do the right thing and be as transparent as possible. When I related my J&J story to some of my colleagues, they were not overly impressed by it, and it does not do your reputation any favours. For me, I am unsure I will ever view J&J with the admiration I had before, despite the wonderful things some say about your business. I however wanted to relate my experience so that other candidates may have a more positive experience with you. Thank you, and I hope you found this useful.  Dev "
"Unfortunately with this particular case, TA Coordinator, I do not have much to comment as the process didn't go further than to nonereply email that I was not selected. However, recently I had an excellent experience with Ms. Gabriela Puflerová for the position of Global Training Coordinator. She is great and sold JnJ very well to me. I hope I will get an opportunity to work for JnJ:). The process is currenlty somehow delayed, but  I believe that things will clear out soon.

Unfortunately it takes more than 2-3 months when passing the underreview line by 30% unless the candidate would not be hired.
"Unfortunately I didn't participate to any recruiting process. Just got the standard message ""thanks for you application""."
"Unfortunately I cannot answer, because I have never selected any position at J&J yet."
"Unfortunately after numerous applications, I have received the same negative response.
I do not know why.
I believe the recruitment process might be too regimented and rejections are done too procedurally. Although at time this is required, I would say the possibilty of employing good candidates escapes Johnson & Johnson as a result. I believe in this area there is room for improvement. 
Thanks."
"Unfortunatelly when I applied for your vacant position of Category Manager (Oral Care) via Profession.hu, website had some technical problems and did not attach my CV, but I did not know about that. Your colleague contacted me after 4 days and asked for my CV. This attention and careful process handling impressed me. But after her e-mail, within 2 hours I received an other e-mail from your talent team, that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue my candidacy for the position. I was confused and frustrated. Of course as soon as I had the opportunity in the evening, I wrote to your colleague, who asked my CV. I sent the CV and asked her about the other e-mail from the team. She replied immediately next day morning, that a colleague just told her that the position was filled already. I was upset, as I found your position really interesting and I felt I could have been a relevant candidate for that with my experience. So I felt, that maybe technical problem of profession.hu caused, that your team could not take my application into consideration. But I also thought, that your colleague, who contacted me directly was very kind and helpful. Technical problems may arise, and she understood that. I also know, that such cases may arise and it is impossible to prevent each one. But based on my mentioned experience maybe I would advise you to improve in information flow, in order to avoid such cases, when colleagues working with the same project do not know about such important milestones. "
Unfortunatefly I have not heard back from Johnson and Johnson regarding my application but I am assuming from this questionnaire that I have not been put through which is very disappointing. In the future it would be good to communicate better with candidates as well as give feedback on the application process.
"Understandably there must have been a huge quantity of applicants, however I would have really appreciated a reason for being rejected at the application process - no matter how feeble or vague. For example, we have filled all our positions, your application was not as strong as others etc. 
Many thanks"

 It took more than five or six weeks to forward just an automated feedback, where other organization of the same size as yours normally they respond within 7 working days at the maximum if not less
 While I can see all selection criteria for the role are close to my profile except for industry background,however coming from multi-national FMCG with solid track record experience across MEA is an added value,However, if the Head of recruitment at your side, the one based in UAE has the same Industry background as mine, since weused to work for same organization, moreover as an HR generalist and Talent Management Head for retail businesss across MEA, while all professional HR qualification, including CIPD,Master degree and many related HR certification, I can proudly say that very few Arabs have such experience, professional qualification or level of education related to HR.. 
Nevertheless, I did apply for another role, as far as I can remember, it was head or Director of HR compliance EMEA. 

I never received any feedback , and no clue , if selection process is over or not, as I did apply for two vacancies at same day .

At the End of job application , you may add one line as statement, if the candidate is not getting any feedback then he is not selected, just to manage candidate's expectations, many local organization are following such rule to minimize or control candidate's expectation ....

I hope you manage to fix such loose ends or loop holes in your talent acquisition process in order to be able to attract the right fit, not only existing vacancy but for future career growth as well, select talent who are promo-table and can be developed to the next level, more important those who can bring value to the table as business partner, HR know how is the most easy part of the selection criteria, commercially acumen talents and HR leaders with thorough understanding of financial analysis and cash flow forecast.....how your recruiters can evaluate such competencies by going through the CV.....

However i have still not received any kind of notification from Johnson and Johnson on the status of my application. I have contacted customer services and the talent community team 3 times enquiring but have heard nothing back.

"This was the second application I had for a position in J&J and I am really disappointed in the company recruitment process. I applied to J&J because I was excited about the company. 
However, after having 2 bad experiences of applying, where the process took months from the one stage to the other, no information about the next steps was given and also no feedback, I am not going to apply again and of course, I do not want my friends to have the same bad experience with me.    "
"This was first time I was on the other side of the recruitment process in 20 years. I've always hired people and was never looking for a job myself. So it was very new experience for me....

I was very much impressed with the automation of the process at first, looked very professional and clear. I did not receive any information from you about the status till I received request for the feedback. so I realised role ifs filled ... through request for the feedback. No one ever talked to me, this was really missing human touch. Same automation which was seen as a benefit at first, became a  negative point at the end. overall it made me feel uncomfortable.
I wish you good luck with the perfecting the process!

"This survey seems to be pointed towards candidates, who were not chosen for the position, however at no point did I receive the information that I was not going to the next step of the recruitment."
This survey it's the only one contakt from J&J. It would be nice to get some feed back.
"This survey does not fit for me, since I was not invited for an interview.

One should have the possibility to skip the questions that do not fit individually.

Best."
This questionnaire does not fit at all the stages I went through. 
This process wat to take a month. It's been taking third month already and we still do not have any results.
this particular position was strictly through website and my communication was generally through internal JnJ person.  no recruiter involved.
this is your job so come with improvement 
"This is the second survey I've received for a position where I did not have any interviews.  I had already accepted another position within J&J and at the same time, did not speak to anyone (HR or the hiring manager) about this position.  Given that, I felt the communication was extremely poor, as I received multiple conflicting emails about the process, next steps, etc (for which I was not involved!!).  Better organization is needed on the part of the Talent Acquisition team."
"This is the first that I am hearing that I will not be considered for this role and this is the 5th survey that I have received for a position that I am not only qualified for, but did not receive any contact from any recruiters.  As an internal J&J employee, a simple e-mail, phone call or even an instant message would have been appreciated.  "
"This is not the first role I've applied to at J&J; I have some good friends that work there and have sent my via via your recommendation programme in addition to my on-line applications. However even the simple Talent Acquisition activities I have been exposed to do not present an organised or coordinated front, for example:

1. When recommended, the role is then either no longer available or give to an internal candidate immediately after the application end date. No feedback given and only once did I recieve an automated 'you were not sucessfull' email
2. No thanking you for applying and giving some feedback as to why you were not a fit
3. Sending this questionnaire to me 3 times within 20 minutes of the first email link

I have not been asked to give feedback before so thank you for the opportunity to do so. Unfortunately I now have quite a sour taste about your recruitment process."
"This is how you can improve the process
#Start active acquisition instead of waiting what the web brings home.
#Build personal contact recruiter & candidate 
#Insure regular and timely updates
#Quit the online tooling, it is not serious for positions like the one I have applied for.
All the best! JHU"
This e-mail schould not be sent to me. I have only sent my application.
think like a job seeker and do as same people expecting from Johnson & Johnson. dont give negative feedback always. reply people in manner to encourage their efforts against searching. give a chance to those for face to face interview who are really interested. this will at least encourage them to keep trying. Silent msgs looks fake and people getting into wrong meaning.

Think
"They should've hire me I have a great expereince and I can add slot of value to the company. However, I was ignored without explanation. 
Now I feel your company is racist. I will boycott it's products. "
They should update us about the application process and give clarity.
They should see the applicants at least for future reference. 
"They should read the CVs of the prospective candidates more closely. 

My skills & experience were very closely matched to the role I applied for but I was not in the slightest even considered for an interview.

Quite frankly a very vague & shabby recruitment process."
they should look at people's with experience like me.
They should let us know the reason for not selecting an employer. 
They should hire me First because I need job 
They should have to give opportunities to Asian specially Pakistanis.
They should go through the applicant profile and educational background then it will be more convenient to the candidate.
"they should give quick feedbacks to the applicants, so that the it will not take a long time to wait."
They should do the initial interview not be based scoring and screening system due to unfairness 
They should directly contact with the candidate. The direct meeting is the best contact or alternatively the telephone conversation.
They should consider  the candidates talent
They should be keen to filter and see all CVs
"They should be having a process to inform the person  who haven't got selected for next round and reason for the same. I have applied for a lot of position & never got a call,how is it possible .It clearly shows that my application is not viewed properly. "
They said I passed the first interview but I don't have news regrding my next interview. I passed it one month ago. 
"They need to keep in touch with candidates.

Thanks so much.
"
They need to create a chain with the young graduates and believe in them not about the final score in the graduation discussion but for the skills they are trying to improve with the company as yours. 
They need to accelerate the process and contact the candidates and share the feedback faster to know if they were picked for interviews or they are not.
They must provide the opportunity to conduct at least brief cognitive talks with those responsible for the position for which they are candidates
They have to announce internship for fresh graduated students every year. 
They didn't contact me
They did not answer to my emails and rejected me just because I was not able to complete the online interview on time (I explained them why). 
They could try to know people before declining them by email.
They could send me a rejection letter instead of asking me to take a survey where the first question tells me I wasn't a good fit for the job. I've not received any communication other than this survey since my video interview. 
"They could have contacted me and explained why I was not a good candidate for the position in question. However, I realize the difficulty they would have, due to the high number of applications. But in relation to the trainee vacancies, I would like to know if they prefer candidates with no professional experience or if it is possible to have experience in another area that is not related to the job vacancy. Besides motivation, what are the other qualities that you want in a candidate? What are the qualities you consider to stand out in candidates who are considering getting started a career in the pharmaceutical industry?"
"They could get back to prospective applicants and let them know why they were not suitable for the position or at least phone them and have a chat 
How can you know if someone is suitable by looking at. CV because  anyone can make up a good CV but can they sell products and have they a good personality are they good with building relationships with customers 

Just my thoughts "
They could explain the reasons why they are not pursuing candidacies
They could contact the person directly and let him/her know what's going on
"They could contact senior alumni like myself, return emails sent direct and
Over linked in asking if they can forward my file (Hr) . Very disappointing ,
Missed opportunity i believe since senior business people in the group recommend to come back.
"
"They could at least call or send an email where they could explain the reasons why I m not good enough for the position! 
I feel bad about the way you loose such talented and motivated people :)"
"They could actually consider applicants who meet all the criteria. 
A phone call or an email at the very least as opposed to a rejection email within 2 hours of sending the application. "
They can start with provinding me the job i applied for. Then I will explain what can be impoved!
They can hire a person from pharmaceutical back ground like me.
They can be more fair when choosing the employee for an appropriate position. 
They can be faster at the process
They are good as the way they are now.
They are excllent in that field don't need much improvment
They actually colud have contacted me!
They  can  invite  the  person  for  further  interview  and  also  she/he  experiences. They  have  to  contact  the  person  by  phone  and e-mail
There's nothing to improve in the recruitment process.
"There was not even a single email message from J&J team to update on the process at least, despite of the hiring decision.

Although, J&J is a world know organization but the talent acquisition team has reflected how the HR would be working internally. I will hardly apply for any future positions at J&J, even if they are very attractive.

Thanks, Usman "
"There was not enough time allowed to complete each stage of the process - only 2-3 days were provided which is incredibly difficult for those trying to complete the application whilst also working, especially as the stages were time consuming. Extra time or a warning at the beginning of the process would have been appreciated. 

I experienced some technical issues for the online interview stage. The support was very helpful but a way to log back in and check the status of your application would have been useful.

The aspect I was most disappointed by was the lack of feedback, or any response whatsoever, as to the result of my application. Having given a significant amount of time to complete the different stages, the least I would have expected was a short response saying I would not be progressing. I only got an automated email saying my video interview had been submitted and nothing further. I did not even receive a response to my follow up email regarding this lack of response. In the future this would significantly impact my decision as to whether to apply for Johnson & Johnson."
There was no schedule or planning all through the process. No information is given even after the recruitment. The expectations were not clear and it was not a fair recruitment process.
"There was no recruitment process at all. I did not receive any feedback nor invitation to attend any stage of the hiring process. I even received the survey link before even receiving a general email saying that I had not been chosen.

I think it really needs to be improved."
There was no recruitment process at all. Few days after posting the advertisement I received an e-mail that the process is stopped. 
"There was no process, only sent the resume, there was no response from J & J"
"There was no process initiated; a generic email response was received.
It would be better if feedback is not sought in such cases - there is really no feedback to provide."
"There was no letter confirming the result of recruitment process, whether the answer was posivitive or negative, please, work on that better. 
Wish you all the best."
"There was no feedback from submission of application through to the form rejection email roughly 2 weeks later. That rejection came less than 24 hours after I completed a previous survey on the process and commented I hadn't received any feedback.

I realise that everything can't be done with a personal touch, but for a company with Johnson & Johnson's credo, I would've expected more of a people friendly approach."
There was no contact.
"There should not be any time restriction (1 year) when applying for a position at Johnson and Johnson. Personally, I applied for a position last year in May and whilst I was shortlisted I didn't get the job in September. I was further contacted in February 2017 by a recruiter at Johnson and Johnson but during the interview process I was told that the interview could not proceed as I needed to wait one year from the last interview process. I think Johnson and Johnson should not have this time limit procedure in place as probably  the company will miss opportunity to work with motivated individuals.  "
There should be responses from the company HR atleast for the applied positions.
There must be process of face to face interview instead of written interview. 
There isn't a structure in the recruitment process. On paper I was very highly qualified for the role however I wasn't even given online tests or interview which doesn't make any sense . I understand not being accepted after an interview but it really does not make any sense to reject someone without giving them a chance. 
there is nothing to improve because the process is already good.
There is not much you can do. The culture in Turkey is different than the States. Any recruiter you employ in Turkey will eventually revert back to the origins.
There is not available an assessment (with score eg 6/10) to understand why the skills doesn't fit with the job description.
"There is no recruitment process to be improved, there is a high level prejudice for friends only, no transparency at all, zero level of equality for talents, this process has impacted the current performance of your employeess who are feeling highly relaxed, and no commitment for timelines, you can check you presence in market, also discounted key products, only successfull projects with outsourcing."
"There is no reaction for 4 months, after that ı get a standard email. 
"
"There is needed to be used more precise approach (any direct feedback from HR). Too long and unpredictable process. I requested to the vacancy more than month ago and still don't have any answers, only some similar surveys."

"There is already a dynamic recruitment process Johnson & Johnson's conducting. In my opinion their should be one exam should conduct from which the best of best would get select, and maintain standard  of company."
There is a fully automated screening process that discards fitting profiles for different roles.  was never given the opportunity to do an interview while candidandomi for lower positions at my skills
"There has been n very little communication back from the J&J recruitment team after I submitted applications on line. Any communication seems to be an automated response, the impression being that the submission has not really been taken into account.
It would be good to have some human contact to provide any candidates sufficient feedback as to why they were not selected or provide current status of the application. 
Also going onto the general J&J careers website there is no easy log-in facility for candidates who have already registered on the talent pool. Sure;y to have this would make sense. 
My experience so far of the recruitment process has not filled me with confidence about landing a job with a company I consider to be at the forefront of healthcare."
"There are very thing to improve, above all on the communication."
"There are many key points to that. First of all, you should state anything else than ""we had candidate that suits better our requirements"". Than, currently many of your employees are looking for another employer and are not very satisfied. As you should be aware, some of them went working for MedTronic, some of your employees that had been working for many years in J&J. Most of your candidates are MDs that just want to get specialization and J&J is place to be until they get it. You should pick candidates that will work for many years, because the most expensive for everyone is to have high frequency of employees. Molecular biologists like could be sales reps even better than MDs, other bioogists and biochemist also. Everyone that finished some kind of natural science of life science college could learn that job in few weeks. More important are communication and social skills, how to represent and sell themself and after that other things."
There are many areas of improvements in the online tool. My opinion is that candidates and potential employees should spend the minimum time possible to apply for a job.
"There are few if I may say,

1. To provide a timely feedback post interview
2. Creating a better atmosphere during the interview
3. Flexibility/providing a room to negotiate the remuneration during the interview
4. Providing the reason for not selecting a candidate so that both can move forward.
 "
"The Wording of your advertisement.
Do not overlook no candidate."
The whole recruitment process took more then a month. Possibly the overall time could be reduced. 
The whole process was automated. HUMAN resources?
the user very unfriendly application system. There is no chance to reset the password.
"The time limit given between the online application form and the video interview is insufficient. Either weekends should not be included or more days are needed to receive the video email invitation, prepare for the interview and then sit down and record it (whilst being at university full time, participating in various sports and societies, having a weekend with pre-arranged plans and tickets, travelling from place to place and all the other commitments that come with a busy university life!) Because of this insufficient time limit, I was unable to complete my video interview and hence missed out on the opportunity to apply. After contacting J&J they said they would look into it but I was never contacted again. Such a shame."
"The time between my submission and feedback from Johnson & Johnson was less than 24 hours. Nobody from Johnson & Johnson reached out to me and I have no idea why i wasn't the perfect fit for the position.

The only thing I received was a standard message."
The tests had some problems in the process and never got a reason to be cut down to improve myself in the future 
"The talent acquisition team should atleast provide clear reason(s)  to an applicant,  if her candidacy is not pursued further. 

I, being a experienced Demand planner , mainly FMCG and Consumer electronics,  was disappointed with JnJ's selection process.

I was sent a standard, system generated email stating my candidacy will not be pursued further. No clear reasons given for my rejection. 

Prior to this, I always held JnJ in high esteem, presuming it to be professional, clear and transparent in its selection process. 

My sincere apologies,  if my comments are hurtful, but I was quite disappointed with this experience. 

Thank you for taking the time, to gather my feedback. 

Kind regards, 
Jennifer. "
"The system is not working for Turkey. I was highly qualified candidate for the role I applied, but I got rejected by the system without any feedback. Now, I got offers from other global big pharmaceutical companies. But , very dissapointed with your recruitment process."
The role title and job description focused on change management yet the primary skills required related to communication management.  Emphasising this  earlier in the recruitment process would have been useful.
"The role I had applied for was a digital marketing role. 

Whilst I felt that the 1st face to face interview went well and that I could fit in to the role due to my digital marketing experience, I was taken aback by the 2nd interview for this role which involved an assessment.

I have no issues being assessed for a role I am applying for. However, I would expect to undertake an assessment that is specific to the kind of role that I am applying for. I do not expect to be assessed on a topic or specialism which is not related to the role I am applying for.

The assessment I undertook was based on a North African wine company wishing to enter the UK market to compete against established wine producing regions. As part of the assessment I was quizzed on how to enter the market, work out market share, order quantities and recommended​ retail prices, to name a few of the points I would be presenting back to the interviewer on.

This type of research is not - or has not - been part of any of the digital marketing roles I have been involved in during my career.

Whilst that type of ""offline"" market research is not an area that I am used to having to consider, online market research is definitely part and parcel of my skillset.

Estimating share of total search volumes, seasonality, types of informational/transactional/brand terms, online competitors, average costs per click, social media landscape, mining digital data to provide insights and having a grasp of the digital landscape are definitely key areas which a digital marketeer should be familiar with and able to action in his/her day-to-day role. 

I believe that any of these areas should form part of an assessment for an individual applying for a digital marketing role at any organisation.

To be honest, after my 2nd interview and the feedback I got back from the recruiter, I felt like I was judged as not being suitable for a digital marketing role at J&J because I provided my answers based on how to grow market share and a brand digitally, which is what I believed was one of the requirements for the role I applied for in the first place.

In my opinion, for any future digital marketing roles that your organisation recruits for, that you should assess candidates on their experience, knowledge and skills in digital marketing. I believe that you are using antiquated and outdated assessments that are not focused on digital, but rather on traditional marketing roles.

For digital marketing related roles, please consider assessing your candidates by allowing them to complete a digital marketing related assessment as part of the process. 

Doing so will ensure you're building a strong digital marketing team, instead of hiring traditional marketeers with some digital experience."
"The result can be faster than now
Can give chance to those who want to prove their talent like me"
The response to the application was very fast. But any reason was provided in the answer.
"The requirements for the position were altered during the selection procedure. Because of this, the position was less of a match to me."
"The refusal reason would be clearly told/explained (experience, age, gender etc.)."
"The recruitment was fine, I do not have nothing bad  about it. All positive"
"The recruitment team should take more consideration about the people who send their applications several times in a short period of time, as long as they have a good career path compatible with their age."
"The recruitment team in the Middle East just ignores candidates, positions are announced and then removed without a reply for candidates, not a single phone call or email was sent to me by any member of the recruitment team, they need to treat candidates with some respect."
"The recruitment process, seems old, outdated and makes Johnson & Johnson look like they do not care."
"The recruitment process was very pleasant and the recruiter handled my application very well. The feedback was a little delayed than i am used to but all in all the recruitment process was very well handled. 

the interview process was slightly more undesired and could do with better processes and abit more of a structured interview rather than the way it was. "
The recruitment process takes much to long. The recruiter should have informed me why I am not suited for the applied position 
"The recruitment process should considered also candidates without degree.
I think I would be a valid candidate...also if I have not a degree.
I hope you could contact me."
"The recruitment process should be much easier and shorter to go through. There are a lot of questions and private things you want to know.
Other companies do that process very easier, it should not take the hole day to go through your process. It is very complicated and much to long. The application documents should be bigger than 2 MB."
The recruitment process should be lit bit much faster and responses in regards to the position applied is very important as well. The position advertised should specify if all nationalities are eligible to apply hence the position advertised is in different country residents.
"The Recruitment process should be honest, clear , transparent and done by a suitable person who has no misconceptions."
"The recruitment process seems completely fair and fast.
Eventually, detail the reasons, so that candidates may try to improve."
The recruitment process is totally fine and efficient. I even could do my first interview remotely. 
"The Recruitment process is too long, I had to talk to 3 different persons but the answer came too late. "
The recruitment process is great. Hopefully there is a job for me as a Registered Nurse. Thank You.
The recruitment process is great. Hopefully there is a job for me as a Registered Nurse.
The recruitment process is good according to my evaluation.
the recruitment process is anonymous and therefore no chance to understand why there was no fit to the applied position
"The recruitment process is already very good. However, a little comment about the reason of the negative responses would be helpful for the candidates in order to improve their further applications."
The recruitment process in the overall takes too much time to close. 
The recruitment process can be much faster
"The recruitment process at graduate level involves a lot of fashionable but not very scientific hoops, similar to many recruitment processes at entry level.

It is frustrating to be ""out of the game"" in filtering rounds if you are aware that your CV (degree from Cambridge, excellent publications during PhD) would be of great interest to line managers if you met them face-to-face."
The recruitment proccess is succesfull.
"The recruitment interface is not really easy to manage...in particular when we want to upload new resume and covering letter for an offer we can by accident delete the resume and covering letter of the other offers.

Moreover, it is sad that we do not have any feedback and that we receive an automatic email... after 4 or 5 months! It would be great that a recruiter gives the reason why we were not chosen."

"The recruitment department or the HR department should at least respond with reasons that led not to proceed further with the candidature.

If I talk about my application, I have 7+ years of experience in Finance and I also have western education in my field which is highly regarded across the GCC.

But still, I have not been considered for some reason. I needed to know that particular reason which led my application to be disregarded."
"The recruiting process can be more transparent. Feedback on why a position is not a good fit should be more detailed, especially to internal employees.
For internal employees, feedback should be given to the aplicant`s supervisor as well on what needs to be developed for the person to qualify for an interview for the position at a point in the future."
The recruiting coordinator gave me 4-5 days to complete online video interviews. These 4-5 days where over the christmas holidays and the coordinator didn't reply to my E-Mails at all. Furthermore I didn't get any constructive Feedback after the process was completed. 
The recruiters have to contact people even if they are not choosen for an applied open job and explain the reasons they do not match
The recruiters could have  called for some additional information since I really believe that my profile fits to the position.
The recruiter would contact with me and provide a information am I steel in recruitment proces  or not
The recruiter was so serious. I did not feel empathy.
"The Recruiter was professional and my overall experience was positive with the exception of the feedback they provided me on why I did not progress was superficial.

I attributed this to the Hiring Manager who appeared to be disengaged from the outset, limited our discussion to my most recent role and did not explore my experience more broadly which would have enabled me to better display my experience - something I felt the Recruiter did very well.  

J&J remains an organisation I respect and would recommend but I was disappointed with my face to face interview experience.   "
The recruiter should provid a reason why the application not accept or not fit for the role applied as this can be a good point for development.
"The recruiter should let us know as soon as we are not successful @ the promised four weeks not me asking after eight weeks and Charles ignoring me even after I tried contacting him through linkedin. But absent of this particular issue, I think the recruiter and the interviwers were pretty cool.

The recruiter should get back to the candidate and provide the candidate with an answer.
The recruiter should contact the candidate and tell why the candidate does not fit the position. The recruiter should spend more time for interviews.
The recruiter should contact candidates and give them information if they are or they are not a good fit for the position they applied.
The recruiter should contact candidate
"The recruiter process seems automatic a couple of hours after filling my application I was inform by an automatic e-mail I did not qualify or position was filled already.
could be more specific on why candidates do not qualified
I lost confidence to apply or recommend you company"
"The recruiter has not contact me nor did I receive a contact person to get in touch with. In addition my application just has been rejected without any comment. Considering the effort on side of the applicant my minimum expectation is to get an indication why I have not even been selected for a personal interview. Sorry to say, but very Unsatisfying overall process. "
"The recruiter don't now the position she is recruiting for; I asked what's the products the PS will promote and she said she would ask and then let me know. In my opinion, it's very important the recruiter to know what is the exactly job mansion every time he/she call someone."
"The recruiter didn't keep me informed of my application to you, I chased how far I had gone down the process and the vacancy had been filled.  
Also the recruiter didn't influence me on the company I just know from other account managers it's a good company to work for "
"The recruiter didn't do any thing at all, didn't contact me, I know nothing about him"
"The recruiter did not respond to emails or phone calls which I found very disrespectful. I had to contact the team members who did the interviews with me to get feedback on my status. The final feedback was, that they have had a long thought on offering me the job or not. Still, 3 month after the final interview is 10 weeks too late. All employees have been very friendly at all stages of the application process.  "
The recruiter did not call me so i cannot tell what to do to improve the recruitment process.
The recruiter could contact me and let me know why I am not a good fit for the role.
"The recruiter contacted me regarding my unsuccessful interview and job application but they didn't provide any reason why I wasn't fit for the job. 
J&J declares it is an equal opportunity employer but the fact is that the interviews are conducted by team leaders not by the HR professionals. So it leaves a huge room for manipulation and inclination towards people they prefer, such as their friends or family members. 
You probably will take all this just as a complain of an unsuccessful candidate, which it is but also the inclination happens and it is widely known between the workers in the factory.
I have been given this chance to have a say,  so I am having my say. 
Thank you very much.
"
The recruiter can send an email either positive or negative.
The reasons for non-selection to be communicated. It would be good if you provide the ways to improve the employability.
"The reason that another candidate fits better to this position is no comprehensible readon to me. I expect a reason like not enough experience, too xoung, no authority in leading people / too less leadership experience.
Some good reason matching my individuality on which I can work and improve."
"The reason I was given for not being invited to interview was because ""Johnson & Johnson are only looking at candidates from their competitors for this role"" 
If this was the case, then why was the recruiter not informed of this prior to submitting my CV? 
"
the reason i got for my application not progressing seemed to be generic although i believe i met all the criteria i could not progress to the the interview stage!
"The processes should be transparent, honest and done by a suitable person with no misconceptions.
Treating candidates with the same awareness."
"The process was very professional, very structured and I got a lot of insight information, which helped me to understand the role very well in short, middle and long-term perspective. So far no point of improvment found. "
The process was fine. I like the fact that I was email quickly to let me know that they were not going to pursue me as a candidate for this particular position. All in all the process is robust and easy to navigate.
"The process time was extremely poor with no interaction from Johnson & Johnson to inform me of progress.  I have applied for several roles but it always takes a long time to hear feedback, which is only ""other candidates with closer experience"".  It would be nice to gain actual feedback."
The process that is in place appears to be more than adequate 
The process needs to be accelerated.
"The process lasted four months, the process is too slow, meanwhile a lot of graduates already got the job. And they didn't explain the work permit problem for me at the beginning. The interview got canceled only few days before the event after I have booked the flights and hotels, and also applied a visa for the interview. 
The feedback of the interview always delayed."
"The process is well organized, and need some attention to personal interviews. Example : may be if the candidate apply for several positions at least one interview needs to be conducted. I see this will increase the level of fair measures in hiring ."
"The process is very anonymous and people do not feel much personal culture.

There is, therefore, no closeness to the company or to recruiting responsible personnel.

Due to this, it is also not easy to get further status info about the recruiting procedure."
The process is satisfactory in general
The process is obsolete. The candidate improves on the process.
The process is not very personal. No reference to a contact can be made and the response seems very standard. 
"The process is not transparent, job description was very broad giving an impression of an open criterion, however immediately after applying I received automated email regretting the application."
The process is not clear. It will be good to receive real feedback and not just automatic replay.
"The process is correct, but it is the normal process of a big company. Even so, you can do it more familiar, you could call to the candidates for example.

Thanks for your interest in my opinion!"
"The process is as impersonal as possible.
I got mail that I didn't fit way too late, did not receive any feedback about working points, even though I asked for it through mail, and I never even got a personal mail.
Very poor"
"The process felt very impersonal. More information about alternative roles more suited to my skills and experience would have been greatly appreciated, as well as feedback on why the application was unsuccessful."
The process can be more face to face!
"The process between my application and invitation for the interview was very quick, Also, the face-to-face interview itself I found as very positive and pleasant experience. During the interview, hiring manager informed me that she would like to invite me for the second round of interview ASAP and I will be contacted by the recruitment team shortly to arrange the date. However, I haven't been contacted by anyone and just after almost 3 months from the interview received an automatically generated message from the system that my application was not successful - without any personalized feedback, which I find quite unprofessional given the circumstances.  "
"The position's title and pay grade being recruited is was the same as my current role, however, during the interview process the job responsibilities we more aligned with one pay grade, even two pay grades lower, as compared to my current organization.  Not sure why this role was posted as Sr Operations Manager PG 31."
"The position was kept posted in EMEA newsletter. The recruiter, however, told me the submission process was closed already, but let me submit my application anyway. After submisision I was cordially thanked and told, they have more exprienced candidates. All this felt a bit murky and made me felt the position was interenally posted only because they HAD TO. In reality the assignment was probably already made."
"The overall impression of the recruitment process was fine. However, in my opinion it would be useful to conduct online interviews instead of automated video interviews, as it is too impersonal. Considering the high application rate, it will be hard to implement tough. "
The only communication from Johnson & Johnson about the process I applied for is the email received concerning the survey. 
"The online recruitment platform is easy to use, quick and gives a positive image of J&J. The reply to not been chosen for an interview came very quickly, so that you have quickly certainty about your application process. However, I would have wished to be chosen for an interview, because I am sure to have a got fit to the position I applied to. After the aquisition of Actelion, J&J is an even more attractive employer for me. So I am looking forward to speaking to you. All the best, Jörg Gärtner."
The online portal automatically sent my application once i got to the last page with no warning not allowing me to add anything. I therefore sent an incomplete application.
The online application process was particularly convoluted and uploading CVs was far from straight forward due to some form of software error.
"The main thing which surprised me during the interview process, was in the final interview, my interviewer had not conferred with those who had interviewed me previously, about me, before speaking to me.
I had expected to sit a more detailed interview and instead half way through I realised the interviewer knew very little about me, and so much of what I had said about myself had no context.
I'm not sure if that could be improved as it may well be intentional for the process to happen that way. Maybe candidates could be better informed about this?

Also the interview process took about 3 weeks, which is an industry standard timeframe, but this lengthy timeframe is undoubtedly damaging the potential labour pool from which this industry can draw it's employees. As the industrious are impatient."
"The lack of human examination of a high qualified candidate (me), I believe is a direct reflection of how J&J views and devalues people as your most important company resource as you let robotic software evaluate a human being."
The Johnson and Johnson should follow up with their candidate up until he is granted a job position 
"The job opening was cancelled in general, which I found very discouraging regarding the competence of the local team.
"
"The job I applied for was put ""on-hold"" before I had my face-face interview. This was disappointing but these things happen. I cannot comment on the interview process beyond screening but up to that point it was fine."
The J&J to give chances to outside candidates of the country and sponser for  their visas. This will definitely help multi-cultural environment in the company resulting in morale booster to the employees.
"The issue was nothing to do with the recruiter or recruitment process... The issue was not obtaining an interview because 'all of a sudden' the position had been filled internally. Although I appreciate both why and how this happens, I believe companies might be missing out on injecting new talent into the business by not at least putting external candidates through the interview process. "
"The IQ tests are not linked to the job to which i applied. I believe i should have received feedback and a result on the tests.

I am slightly disappointed as my mother is an employee and went through a completely different recruitment process.
"
The interviews/meeting should be done also on Saturday and not only from Monday to Friday
"The interviewer Demir Baalzi started the interview like ---You are the last to be interviewed any way go ahead, I don't have any previous interviewing experience so just go a head....
The interviewer Baalzi is from a sales background having no experience in Engineering/manufacturing either but assigned to select candidate for a manufacturing position.
Though i had 10 years of Engineering background he picked one particular part of my career and started the interview by commenting that ----you got  only 3 years experience...
Overall he sounded like a Clueless Jealous racist."
"The HR never replies, I still haven't heard back from the team. I've had two interview sessions with more than a month gap in between and was very keen on joining J&J. I've always imagined J&J as a great place to work but this recruitment process has put a question mark on my mind. After my second round of interviews, I had high hopes that I would be selected, and have put some plans on hold, yet the HR never got back to me with an update. 
Lastly the career portal, would be a good to see the application status and progress as currently it doesn't have that feature. "
"The HR department needed more than 2 months for an impersonal refusal. If this is the way you show appreciation for applicants and possible employees, I must say J&J is not the right company for me."
"The HR department definetely needs to reply to emails and phone calls.
Although the email said that the psychometric tests would be sent to me shortly, this never happened. 
 It also needs to send an email on why a candidate was unsuccessful so he/she can improve themselves next time. "
"The HR department can improve their service by easy to follow instructions , Giving equal opportunity, by making the online application for graduate program more smart phone friendly. "
The follow-up seems to be very poor and thw process very slow. I didn't receive any feedback during 4 months! 
The follow up was very late and just a standard reply
"The firstly, they must reach candidates! 
This alert or mail just like a robotic or for your survey...You can't reach real candidate!"
The feedback took too long (approx. 2 months from posting the CV).
"The feedback is very important in any case, whether the employee accepted or not. "
"The feedback and timeliness on outcome needs to be worked on. Unfortunately  I found out that I had not been successful with this application from other J&J people and reached out to the talent team to get an update, also the feed back as to why I was unsuccessful was very poor and did not give me any real information that I could work on.
I also reached out to the hiring manager for feedback and after 3 weeks I had not heard anything so sent a follow up email but unfortunately she has chosen not to reply. I find this extremely disappointing and not in line with what I would expect from a leader in J&J.
I would be more than happy to discuss this further.

Stephen."
The exercise was not transparent enough.
"The entire experience is very unpersonal and the updates are very scarce so it is sometimes unknown wether you're still in the process or not. If the process takes so long, one should receive timely updates on the progress. Overall one feels treated as a worthless piece of labour force.
I recommend at least going back to skype-interviews. The online tool is very strange to handle, miserably programmed, and unflexible."
The current recruitment process is good enough to find out the right candidate for the right job.
"The corporation should expain why the candidate was not selected what is missing from his/her profile or even better what more he/she should focus on. Although this requires time, I consider it is the HR's obligation to respond in this manner rather than just typing the norms and stating that other candidates are a better match. "
The contact is really imoprtant. And I did not get any. 
The Company's Recruiters should give more details related candidate's recruitment process and the reason of not chosen for the position appy for.
The company should relay specific reasons why you were not selected.
"The company should focus on more likely scraper candidates and should evaluate the candidates as a composition. Candidates who are assessed must not be evaluated on the basis of only those schools where they graduate. It should also be examined what difficulties it has encountered throughout life, what achievements it has achieved, how clear the development is, and how successful it is in interpersonal communication. Graduating from only the best universities is not enough to make a sustainable working life success. And this is proving dense circulation within the companies. "
The company should contact every potencial candidate with specific reason why they are not selected in the process.
The communication process can be shortened a bit.
"The communication and feedback was very poor.
The assesment was very strange for the function.
I had to phone myself for feedback after 3 weeks.
"
"The challenge was against internal candidates which was not transparent until the decision was made.
In this way the process seemed unfair as there was no way external applicants would be successful if internal applicants are preferred. Although I understand things can change in large organisations, this should have been made clear far earlier not at the conclusion of the decision."
The career website should be more user-friendly and intuitive to use. 
The candidates are humans and have a heart. They are not robots with some education.
The candidate shall be subjected to entire recruitment process.
The candidate shall be subjected to entire recruitment process instead of dropping at the start.
The candidate shall be subjected to entire recruitment process
The candidate shall be exposure to entire recruitment process.
"The business needs are understandable, it would be appreciated to contact te applicants and provide a reason why they were turned down for the position applied to, this would help both sides to work on their profile, especially the applicant who could understand the reasons and improve his profile if needed or to understand the relevance, overqualified, underqualified, etc.
Thank You.

"The assessment centre was well run, and I was happy with the day. The recruitment process generally was quite organised and Johnson and Johnson kept in touch throughout. 
However I received no feedback from the assessment centre other than the following generic feedback ""Unfortunately, our team did not select you for further consideration at this time, but we would like to keep your application on file for positions that might arise in the future."" I repeatedly tried to organise feedback but received no response. Feedback would help me considerably for future assessment centres."
The application was rejected almost instantly making me feel a bot looked at it not a human. And no one likes a templated thanks but no thanks reply when you know you could do the job. 
The application tool is time consuming and complex - there are i believe at least two ways to access job applications. Last time I had to fill in same set of questions several times.
"The application process is simple and I like that.  I would have liked to have been given a reason for my application being denied.  I felt like I was a strong candidate for the position.   

I also noticed that some other companies will also send recommended jobs based on the profile created.  Ecolab is one example of a company that does this. 

I know J&J is an excellent company.  My father retired from Depuy a few years ago and I would really like the opportunity to work here.  I will keep applying for jobs in the future. 

Thank you,

Andrew Powers"
The applicants are human beings not names or numbers on a computer program. 
"The applicant should be told, why his application was not fitting to the requirements of the posted position."
The answers time 
The answers should come sooner! The recruting partners chosen by you were not so prepared for the interview.
The above is self-explaining.

sometimes it happens that the applicant have no news about the recruitment process for a certain position for months.
Sometimes CVs do not fully display your capabilities and core competencies which causes the rejection of candidate appointment though candidate believes himself fully fit for applied job. I think their should be a mechanism where candidate receive a chance to interact with recruiter to share all where he is unable to mentioned to his CV.  
"Sometime a resume could be not enough to evaluate a candidate, even for a skilled recruiter."
Someone with nine years of relative experience with Johnson & Johnson who was an executive director should have at least been interviewed for the job...
"Somehow make a review of the CV received and assess whether they could fit in some specific areas - provide the feedback to the candidates,"
Somebody is to call and advise on what would be best suitable area we would better area's for us to apply and adjust our resume for.
some type of feedback
"Some people are mabybe not just familiar with your process of candidates screening, he failed the process, it does not mean he just can not fit for your company, that being said, it is always better to provide a reason why you reject a person, so that person can not only improve or if he disagrees, there is always a room for feedback.  "
"Some of these questions are too black and white - for example for some interview stages I received feedback promptly, however the last stage took several weeks. Also, the recruiter was not able to provide feedback as to why did I not get the position but the hiring manager called back and explained. Still it should not take weeks to make the final decision after all the interviews have been completed. 

Mine was probably an unusual case. However I was lost why did JJ invite me to apply for a position in customer service requiring fluent French when I have no customer service experience and my resume clearly states I am not a fluent French speaker. 

Considering how much does JJ want to grow and how apparently close the final decision was, I would advise JJ to consider how to use a strong candidate within an organization rather than just moving on. Talent management is about more than just fitting one box or one position - I teach the theories - so if you have two people who impress senior managers, it might be a good idea to look whether the organization could benefit from candidate's strength in other areas. In my case it was not customer service officer for French market. However my long experience in business education environment and information management could be very useful in learning and development or in onboarding process....  "
Some kind of information about the status of the process would be a good help.

Since I work at JnJ at the same location as the HR is placed I would expect that HR informes me directly and not via a standard email to the private email.
"Since I have only been through the first 10% (maybe) of the recruitment process, I'm not able to give any advice on this issue. Had I been invited for a discussion, perhaps I could have received some insight on your talent acquisition methods. "
"Since I didn't receive any reply in regards of my application, I think it would be nice to get some sort of reply even if it is negative."
"Since I didn't enter the next round of the recruitment process, I don't have enough data to suggest something constructive. I thought about suggesting giving a simple task as part of the process to see how the candidates think, but that may as well be a part of it, and I don't know it. 

Cheers."
"Since I applied, there was actually no other communication or feedback with regards to my applications, other than an e-mail stating I was not withheld as a candidate. I also got two requests to fill out a survey."
"Simply, to do recruitment process!"
"Simply, an HR has to contact candidates wheather they are qualified for the position or not."
Simply provide a clear message that a candidate is not being considered for a role.  I have been surprised that I have received a multitude of emails asking for me to provide a survey and not one email to tell me whether or not I am being considered for the role that I applied to.
Simply give feedback to candidates. I have not heard back from J&J at all after I applied for the job.
"Simply compel your HR staff in Switzerland to do away with the xenophobia.Run your numbers there and see how many workers, on the floor are American or non European.Or even Swiss by birth. It is a known problem here and this just exacerbates the situation."
Simply at least contact the applicant by phone or mail to provide him with reasons why his application was not proceeded further. I've already applied to 2 or 3 offers from Johnson&Johnson and I have never had a single human contact so far.
Simplify the online application.
Simple and fast!
"Significant technical issues occured during my online testing, preventing me from accessing the assessment. This could have been better if Johnson & Johnson helped me in resolving the issue with their test provider rather than telling me to sort this out myself. 

I informed the recruitment team of this feedback from the assessment organisation and went through much uncertainty as to whether I could sit the test due to the deadline passing. I was later informed that the deadline would be extended but very little time was provided to complete the assessment. This needs to be a more realistic timeline. 

I passed this assessment and was invited for the online interview but had only 2 days to sit this. This timing was unsuitable and I simply had no opportunity to complete this in such a tight timeframe.

"Several well qualified talented peers & colleagues of mine have actively approached JNJ in the UK recently. My experience was much like others where by we applied directly using the portal but also with additional personal messages on email to respective recruiters. The responses were either non existent, highly inaccurate or worse. Being rejected for a role is absolutely fine but there is a severe lack of any kind of future networking with candidates which will ultimately negatively cost JNJ in the long run. A real shame for such a good organisation."

"Send a notification that positions were filled or that application was unsuccessful. It is understandable that the high volume of applications would result in a stressful undertaking with a commitment to replying to all individuals, but bulk notifications are a common and relatively easy process for notification purposes, and is a process an amateur could undertake. It gave me an impression of an unorganised and/or a somewhat disrespectful process and a view that the process lacks pretty much any form of quality control, which highly surprised me in that all I had researched and had heard about J&J, was that it was a quality organisation. My view has changed. My view has been highly influenced by the recruitment process, it seems that no overview or consideration was given to the recruitment process at all if it was subcontracted to an agency."

"Screen CVs more appropriately 
Allow people who have a different growth trajectory into the process. People can surprise you.  

For instance in this case people outside of the medical industry but with supply chain background or middle managers with extensive leadership or operational experience could have have been a part of the hiring pool.

Using the standard ATS system and recruitment guidelines only limits the potential of your hiring pool to group think if rigidity is placed into the hiring system."

"Regarding this survey, your main question is if recruiter contacted the candidate, and the system works with automated (no reply) emails which don't really qualify as communication with a recruiter. 

The online application process had a problem uploading the resume. Only Google Drive was working. 

The UK based positions were advertised globally on J&J portal, however most of the questions were related to the eligible documents in UK, which leeds to the conclusion that you are looking for UK based candidates only.

"Regarding this position I applied for, i never recieved feedback so far.

Although I still find Johnson and Johnson my favorite company to work for,
I cannot agree postively with questions above because i couldn't get any feedback.

1.Don't send out automated fake emails saying congratulations you have been referred. It is misleading."
Recruitment process to be more quicker
Recruitment process should be fair and transparent and completely on merit
Recruitment process seems to be managed by robots. Any real people work there?
Recruitment process quite straight forward and intuitive. It would be nice to hear back from the recruiter on the status of the application 
"Recruitment process is pathetic. They don;t even bother to call even and know if I am fit or not.

Looks like all set inside this just to show they have followed the process."
Recruitment process is ok - at least the first part of process I experienced.
Recruitment did great job!
"recruiters should know candidates more close, they have to know candidates ability and strong skills. interviews are regular and these type of interview can't show  if the position fits on candidate or not. 
recruiter must care especially internal candidates career plans, goals and personal skills"
"Recruiters should be aware of the J&J CREDO.
Be more professional and step away from misconceptions."
"Recruiters on the final decision of recruitment must be more penalized when they make their wrong choice, it will cause less money to lose the business. I am very grateful to be able to receive me even to tell me not after a day of maintenance would have been greatly appreciated."
Recruiter should send an information is candidat still in recruitment proces or not
Recruiter should have more knowledge or details of the respective job.
"Recruiter should at least contact an interesting profile like mine through a first phone interview. It's often a mistake to reject an application without knowing better a person, especially when it seems there is a lack of good worker ethics."
"Recruiter havent invited me for interview and ı havent got any call or request

"Recruiter contacted me only once, although I had replied for 3 jobs."
Recruiter / HR should be present at interviews - inappropriate questions during interview - ensure interview follows equal employer guidelines / credo

Provide a little more feedback 
Provide a followup email why I was not a good fit and that my application was reviewed by someone. I found out via this survey instead.
Provide a feedback/reason/at least 1 suggestion to the candidates (at least those on short list). In this way they feel appreciated as an individual candidate and this even though they were not what you were looking for at that moment.

"Provide a feedback, even negative. "

Provide a detailed feedback. Refer some aspects to be improved by candidates so we as candidates can improve our weaknesses.

"Processes more clear and timely feedback. The possibility to applied to real open job postings. Occasionally also consider the meritocracy as features, without always considered as priority the the personal connection and cunning."
Process works Well.
Process is fairly good.
"Process is extremely slow, I was contacted my Recruiter in Dec 2016 & Mar 2017 I received email that I am not selected.

Though I have an extensive knowledge and experience for the job & position and I believe that preference given to someone with internal reference.

I was very confident about that job and my interview was very good and relevant to the topic, though the information shared with me not exactly matching what an Interviewed asked me.

I was very excited and passionate about that particular job and profile which matches perfectly with my experience and is always applying and looking for an open opportunity."
"Proactively check in with previous applicants

There are many reasons why some people in your candidate pool (i.e. individuals who have previously submitted an application to your site) may not be the best fit for your current job opportunities. However, they may be a fit a month, six months, or a year down the road. Don’t expect them to consistently reach out to you in the future, but put timing on your side by:

periodically reaching out to them by emailing newsletters or press releases about significant company developments;
making sure they are subscribed to your automated job alerts so that they receive a notice any time you post a new job;
sending your top passive candidates a personal note every so many months to stay in touch

Plz clarify more the reasons behind unselected candidates 
Pls send reply whether suite or not and call to inform the result
"Please, speed up the proces. It took almost 3 months before I heard I was not the right one for J&J in this position."
"Please, provide at least some feedback to the candidate.
I applied to the role through a number of channels - LinkedIn, local Russian headhunter website, company own website. The role posting is still open for a few weeks by now, however, there was no indication if the application was open/reviewed. 
Thank you"
"Please take my suggestions & Views:

Please read my cv .thanks 
Please provide the details for reasons for not being selected. I've received rejections that your resume doesn't make you not suitable for this position. Instead it would be better if you provide technical reasons and how to improve it. This will make a candidate to prepare accordingly. As Johnson & Johnson is prestigious company everyone will have a goal to work in it. I think the clarity in recruitment is the utmost important.
Please provide feedback for unsuccessful candidates especially as they progress to 2nd stage of interviews. Thank you.
Please provide a rough timeline during which an applicant can expect response. It is quite funny that I haven't heard back for my application ( almost 2.5 months) yet I am asked to review the  recruitment process.
Please provide a nome of the recruiter of the position ao you know where you can ask about more information. Four months of waiting is just too much to be informed that your application will not be considered. You should at least provide some information or a contact so that I know why...
"Please provide a justified reasons in case of rejection or even not accepting the resume after being reviewed.. I think it needs more human interaction rather than the robotic senseless feedback.

"
"Please provide a constructive feedback to why candidates are not chosen especially if candidates meet all your job criteria.

Also I was surprised how I was considered for a direct hire mid career level job "" Demand Planner and at the same time I was considered for a very junior non rewarding temporary role as a Supply Chain Coordinator that was an obvious downgrade to my career!"

normal, right?

We are talking about management or specialist level!!!"
"Personally respond to every applicant no matter how hard this maybe.

Tell them the truth when you do contact them with specifics as to why they are not suitable.  Just the old line ""there were others who suited our needs more than you"" does not really wash as I only apply for jobs for which I am very qualified to cover and I would appreciate the truth sometimes that I am over qualified or that I am more qualified than the line manager for even their role.  All I seek is a job to allow me to prove my worth and in future to give me opportunities for advancement.

I cannot recommend a company which treats applicants as batch numbers.

"Personally let people know why they aren't a fit.
"
"Personalize the recruitment process and give the opportunity for a large number of candidates to express themselves, specially if the candidate was previously invited by J&J.

Personalize more the recruiting process. Good candidates may be left out for relaying in automated systems.
"Personal replies, with the specif reason why we were not the person that was hired.
"
personal interviews
"Personal Contact, not only automatic generated mails"
"Personal contact would be helpful. 
The position was posted twice. I received one rejection and am not sure whether I am still in the race. "
Personal contact versus an automated email
personal contact to a recruiting person at HR and not only through the system
"personal contact by the recruiter would be highly appreciated, also to explain the reasons for a good or not a good fit, we are not anonymous robots"
Personal contact by phone
Perhaps they should contact the interesed person and inform him about the status of his appliance.
"Perhaps shorten the recruitment process. As a candidate I do realize that big corporations and the selection process does take a long cycle and is subject to several factors ,however if the process is to be bench marked to the average recruitment process with other corporations it might be quiet lengthier.  "
"Perhaps give a 24hours notice prior to carrying out a telephone interview.

"People from the local HR department should be involved. In case of any questions, the applicant has no chance to reach the recruiter. No name, no phone number or mail account was mentioned."

At the end of the process i received a feedback that the position was cancelled. 
Feedback to me on how i could or not fit the requirements for the job was never given."

This survey is about the recruitment for a position for which I never got any answer!! How ironic...

Maybe, it is better to give an automatic answer (as I received for one application) than no answer at all. You need to let the candidates know that they can move on!!"
"Only issue I have is not being contacted about the result of my application - I appreciate there were applicants better suited to the role, but it would have been beneficial for my development to understand the reason I did not progress any further. "
"One thing that I would suggest is if the Precise reason instead of Generic one provided to Candidate, will help him understand his weakness and convert it into its strength over the period of time to reapply in the future."
"On this occasion, I did not receive any communication from J&J after applying for this position "
"On regards the application process the simpler you do the better ... and it is highly appreciated your reply to the candidates you reject this made your company serious and good because you communicate with education also the bad news  not very common these days to have respect with all the people who apply for jobs, thank you...."
"on no account should they not be limited to a cv which is false in many cases, but they should try to contact everyone and explain the reasons for the rejections, like other multinational company."
"On my opinion, receive feedback is important. Is quite rare to provide to the candidate that was choosed.. no-one will say.. ""I have choosed You for those reasons.. ""
In opposite, provide a feedback why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to, put the recruiter to think about it, and the candidate to know gaps and in case improve it for the future.  Feedback is magic; transfer negativity is positive opportunity 

I hope that it will help
Best Regards

ok
"Often only the described in the CV does not translate the full potential of the candidate.
They're letting to hire competent people for a very narrow anális of CV."
Offer valid and transparent feedback rather than an irrelevant untested aspect of my cv as a reason for non offer following a 1/1 phone call which had been preceded by a formal interview. I was truly disappointed at how I felt I was treated in the end. It took 3 weeks and 3 unanswered emails before the recruiter replied to me and even then the reply was unsatisfactory given how the application had initially progressed. 
Offer similar roles to people from outside of the industry 
Offer more feedback and give internal candidates at least the possibility of an interview. In this application no one contacted me ate all other than receiving more than two months after the application an automatic e-mail saying that my application was not considered.
"offer me a position
"
Offer me a job.
Offer feedback to applicants
Offer better contract
"Of course, I'm waiting. Thank you! "
"nsert some kind of capability test (on the subject in question) after resume screening to give a real chance to those prepared. 
Also, in my case, the fact that I do not live in the countries of the position might have affected, but that's my next career move and I do not expect any relocation package. I did not have the chance to state that."
Now I didn't get exact structure of your interview but if you can arrange telephonic or Skype or face to face interview that's more better 
Notify if discarded

"Nothing, there has been's. nothing invented lately just manufacturing same old stuff"
"Nothing to improve, all is going well, please try to give opportunities to freshers. Thank you.

Nothing much but maintain this process.

Nothing in addition to what has already been suggested. Thank you.
Nothing I can think of.  You replied quickly after I applied to one of the positions that I was not selected.  I am unlikely to recommend J&J to a friend or family because I just have such limited experience/interaction with the company.
"Nothing else, it is a very serious and comintment company with their employees as I know."

In short, you had a broken system area, an HR staff unable to process and manage ad hoc or support, no way to break the cycle of referral when an issue arose and I was unfairly rejected for a job that I could not even apply for and now cannot be referred back into the talent pool.  I very much admire and would like to work for J&J but the Talent Acquisition process, systems and people need some refinement."
"My friend referred me for two positions. I submitted application for one of the position. I wanted to correct one of the field for this application (which I was able to do) but after correcting this field, when I was resubmitting the corrected application the system took the attached CV and covering letter for both the position. So probably options on the website should be more clear.
Thanks."
"My e-mail reply did not contain a reason for the rejection and was very generic:

""Thank you for your interest in career opportunities at Cilag GmbH International.

We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Senior Financial Analyst (000017DN) at Cilag GmbH International

We encourage you to continue to review the job openings...""

Even if there had been a reason given a phone call would have been much more polite and desirable. "
"My CV was submitted into your system by an external recruiter. I received system emails telling me I needed to complete details in it, however the recruiter informed me that I did not need to do this or take further action. It's very confusing as a candidate when you have two different messages, especially as I was extremely interested in the job and the Company and didn't want to do the wrong thing. 
I received no feedback as to why I wasn't suitable except that I wouldn't be interviewed, as no feedback was provided to the recruitment agency."
"my cv was not looked at by recruitment, it was just passed through a computer system searching for key words. The job minimum requirements were 0-2 years with chemistry experience in Hplc,KF, Wet Chem, of which I have 2 yrs experience, I was not even called for a phone interview. Just automated message saying I was unsuccessful.  I think the process is poor , atleast have a person look at the cv and talk to prospective candidates.


"
"My application was not successful, which is fair enough, but then you send me a load of forms asking me what I think. Given that we did not engage I find the forms irritating"
My application was just rejected by an automated email saying that recruitment committee did not feel I am the right person for this position. I am really surprised getting this email from a big company like J&J where I am working as vendor for the same job role for last 5 years. I understand there may be different reason for not selecting me but how a person can be judged by just seeing the resume and not contacting him personally or talking to him.
My application was a referal from an employee. I think at least HR could contact the J&J employee to ask him why he thinks the candidate is a good choice. It can give HR a better understanding of the motivation of the candidate.I was very disappointed by the process.
must be quick in reply the applicant application with good resons
"Motivate and describe the few reasons why you have not selected the recruiter for the position.
It will be very appreciate to improve own professional skills"
Mote care and respect
"Most of the job offers request work experience in the sector, ignoring that the young people are the first ones to look for job.
How can a young graduate to have experience, if nobody gives him the opportunity to do it?"
"More Transparent
Give a proper response to person who submitted their profile for any position
Don't drag the recruitment process for various other reasons"
More transparency.. I didn't even know whether I was selected or not. 
more transparency on the requirements for the position. 
More transparency on the recruiting process including on-line testing and video interview as qualifying factors to next stage recruitment process.
"more transparency on the process and potential ""preferred"" candidates. Provide quality feedback. My experience with the feedback:

* I only got a call from the recruiter once I had reached out proactively myself (as it had taken almost a month after the interview and I still did not hear anything)

* Provide transparent and honest feedback and encourage the hiring manager to do so as well. I got a 1 min call from the recruiter with a non-substantiated feedback on why I was not considered and the hiring manager even did not bother to call me...Very, very, very disappointed in the whole process with no respect for the people who went through the effort of applying. "
"more transparency as to why my countless applications over the years fall on seemingly deaf ears is needed. Despite having a great deal of transferrable skills and experience, I strongly suspect that there are other mitigating factors such as local nationalist tendencies of the local recruiters and other discriminatory practices at work. I would very much recommend that the recruitment function lay in the hands of individuals outside the influence of local country political influence  to eliminate preference for Swiss national candidates over EU candidates."
More transparency and interest in candidates
"More timely feedback - even if just to state the fact that the process is taking longer than expected.

Recruiter should make an attempt to speak with the candidate on the phone & respond to follow up email - my experience when I queried 4 weeks post interview, was that my attempt at contact was ignored.

Having worked with j&j before, I can honestly say that this is the first time i have had a negative experience, and it does make me wonder if the company has changed & that standards have slipped.
"
More technical assessments.
More stages for junior
"More specific feedback would be helpful, rather than the standard ""other candidates were a closer fit"". 
e.g. I have no consumer healthcare background, yet I still do not know whether J&J would consider me for further positions or not. 
It would be helpful to have a steer on this, to enable me to take J&J off my target list if it is a non-starter."
More respect!
More respect to the applicants and mindfulness.

More feedback.
"More feedback during the interview.  When I asked, after giving an answer to a vague-ish question, whether the answer was at the level they wanted, they didn't respond and simply asked another question.  

I then ended up failing to get the role as it was deemed I wasn't hands-on enough, despite the fact I could have given hands-on type answers (e.g. SAP transaction codes, script commands etc) if I thought that was what was wanted at the time!"

"More clear and simple process.
Provide feedback
Speed in communication"
more clear and friendly process of recrutation ( navigation)
More careful attention should be given to individual profiles. No recruiters ever contacted me concerning the reason for not being selected even if my profile did fit the applications I was interested in. 
More and better quality feedback is required. I work as a contractor in J&J and I knew who had the position before I found out I did get an interview. Terrible behaviour especially in relation to internal candidates. It took three weeks to get feedback from HR. Need faster response time in informing all candidates about the position. 
"Money Talks, s... walks "

Maybe you can actually contact me or notify me about the process.

Maybe read the CV and not send out generic emails and give constructive feedback
"Maybe providing a feedback why application was rejected:
1. It would provide respect for the jobseeker for time spent processing the application and can be an indicator of how a corporation would treat its potential and future employees and assets.
2. Give an indicator of gaps to cover for candidate really interested in joining j&j"
"Maybe one on one contact maybe be phone to give reason as to why you didn't get the position

Maybe it should interact more directly with the chosen profiles
Maybe is better to have chance more people to be part of J&J recruitment process because it is better to see experience and challenges of people
Maybe if you could get back to the candidates within a week that would be good. Waiting 2 weeks is a bit too long.
Maybe add a little more a reason why the application failed?
Maybe actually consider the experinece of thenperson applying for the job instead of rejecting appications for no reason whatsoever.

"Make the recruitment process less time consuming and clearer from the start. I was in the process for weeks and did over 5 interviews with 8 different people as well as a case study and a logical mathematical test. And had I passed the math test there would have been at least another interview more. I understand J&J wants the best of the best but it did get to a point where I wasn't even sure if the company was right for me. I do have to say that all the people I interviewed with were great and did make me think more favourably about the company, so in other words the recruitment process was the one who left a sour taste about the company as it felt over complicated."
"Make the process work

"Make the process much much shorter - I went through nearly 4 months of long gaps between stages with little or no communication or feedback.

At the deciding stage (I was apparently one of two at that point) the other candidate had their session with the interviewers over a month after I had done so.  This cannot be a level playing field as I must have been a distant memory by then.  Surely best and fair practice is to see people within a week or so of each other.

It would have been bad enough going through such a long and frustrating process and to then get the job but to not get it - with only a one-liner saying why - is extremely disappointing."

Did the recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to?

Did the recruiter invite you to join Johnson & Johnson's talent community?"
"Make sure all the profiles are read.
I was very confident my experience and skills would be a great fit. Did not understand why I just received a canned response saying that other candidates were a closer match to the role.
I understand giving personalised feedback to everyone would be very difficult, but would definitely be differentiated.

Less distant and automated accompaniment during the recruiting process. It is very impersonal and it is hart to get clsoer feedback from the recruiter why you are not selected for further steps.

Dear Sir:
The recruiter can contact me directly with a letter. I am highly interested in a position at Johnson & Johnson Corporation.

"Job Ref.: 0000170J ""Senior Planning Manager""
After having been for two f2f Interviews on site (Janssen/Cilag, Schaffhausen, Switzerland, HR Manager: Mr. Burgener) and a Video-Conf. weeks later, I still didn't here anything back from the company resp. HR-Manager. I applied on 17.10.2016, 1. Interview was on 15.11.2016, 2. Interview only on 6.12.2016. After several e-mails I finally received a feedback and the invitation to the 3. Interview (Video-conf), which only took place on 26.01.2017. Now we have soon mid. April 2017 and still no news or feedback or any rejection letter received. Very poor recruiting and it is not expected for a world leading pharma company. Won't apply for a job with J&J any more!!  Peter Schlatter (peter.schlatter@breitband.ch)"

"Jnj should give reasons if they are not persuing the candidate who satisfies all job specifications  requirements. 

The mail says only
""We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Software Engineer (1700141148W) at Johnson & Johnson Vision Care (Ireland) Limited""

The mail should be more elaborative. It should explain all points with valid reasons. 
At least jnj should take one telephonic or skype interview to decide something.

It will be helpful for candidate to understand at least where the candidate is lacking in talent and will believe on company recruiting process.

The regression mail I received from jnj says no without any explanation and hence I am highly disappointed.

"JnJ may do the followings;
-instead of hiring someone full-time consider to hire more people part-time from different locations  with different cultures doing the same which can result in a great consolidation of understandings
-provide an independent group of advisers, understand their competencies or just give them brief training, then use them as needed in accordance with their experience level. Examples would be; one month project contribution as member/lead, two months concentrated recruitment process, occasional/project base advisory jobs, etc.."
JNJ could contact however the candidate whether adequate or not adequate. At the people like to have always a feedback.
JnJ could always gives feedback to the candidates after the selection process
"JnJ can do as follows:
-for specific positions, regarding diversity policy, instead of hiring someone full-time consider to hire more people part-time from different locations with different cultures doing the same which turn out to be a consolidation of understandings
-provide and independent group of HR responsibles, make sure their competencies or just give them brief training, then use them as needed in accordance with their experience level. This kind of may be such as; one month project member/lead, two months concentrated recruitment process

J&J should stop using resume screening software and use humans to check applications. The application process is too rigid and you are missing out on unique talent. The company needs to think outside the box when recruiting. I am a MSc graduate with MBA experience from a top business school. The position I applied for was a position where I held the correct qualifications and skills yet I got rejected without a human eye even looking at my application. I spent a significant amount of time on my application (at least an hour on my cover letter) and my efforts were not appreciated in any way. 
"J&J should provide an opportunity to have at least a job interview, because in my case I've been"
J&J should get in contact with the participant and clearly explain the reasons why they choose or not a person and being fair too. And being also available to answer to questions. 
"J&J should explain more about the process and give feedback after each interview. I had 5 interviews and only got a reaction after de last one. I did not know during the process what was good or wrong because a lack of feedback. And the feedback should be information which I could use. I got the reaction "" to hard"" and with that kind of ""feedback"" I can't improve my application/conversation"
J&J should be closer to its customers
"J&J recruiters/talent acquisition specialists could at least start by providing feedback on the status of the applications, i have applied to several jobs and do not know the status of my candidature, it has been some time. I have only received feedback for one. The others no, one of the others doesn't even has had several name changes. 
For the rejection i received, i did not received honest/transparent feedback, i realize that J&J must receive tons of candidatures but there are so many minuses and this does not help."
"J&J needs to head hunt talent for its vacancies. Relying on agencies and websites is easy, talent lies beyond a resume, human interaction is key. Example: HR should be able to map out a talent Pool of 100 to 200 people and say these are the individuals that we want for key positions if they ever got vacant"
J&J might meet more candidates or explain to everyone why it was not called for an interview
"J&J may improve the process by letting applicants know if they have been successful or not, I have received not communication about this. 

Am I to understand from the question ""Did the recruiter contact you and provide a reason why you were not a good fit for the position you applied to?"" that my application is not being progressed?

Not perhaps the most professional way of treating prospective employees."
"J&J judge the candidate only from the CV, i underestand that it has a huge number of candidates and thats why it can filter the candidates through reasnoble tests or another tests that analyze the candidate personality...etc.  without any bias based in the exam result. "
"J&J is the largest company around the world,I think they should do more effort and new idea's,I am sure there are great candidates they lost.
Focus and to take time is important too."
"J&J is a great company and I am proud to work here. Nonetheless, the recruitment process is far from optimum and, honestly, somehow disappointing for such a world-class company. The main reason behind is, in truth, the leadership of the recruiter (or lack of) more than the process itself - position/role are not clearly defined ; when there is an identified replacement (succession planning or else) the all recruitment become awkward ; feedback, if given, is weak at best... Having said that, with the diversity of recruiters, HR shall get more involved to truly develop and leverage talent pipeline in the recruitment process. For CLS, HR role and influence is, at best, limited - and in my opinion inexistant. "
"J&J has defined a well recruitment process, supported by an spectacular web site, however the notification emails look like templates, and details information from the recruiter where not provided, this information could help me for future applications to J&J. Thanks."
"J&J has a very good reputation in the pharmaceutical sector and in the world, my advice is not in the recruitment part but in the visibility and the HR marketing in algeria, J&J need to be more present in the algerian market."
"J&J Graduate recruitment Supply Chain Cork Ireland:

The recruitment process is very good and detailed. The tasks carried out were also relevant and was happy to have gone through them. J&J as a brand I completely respect and look upto. But when asked for feedback on my recruitment process, I never got an answer back. I totally understand being rejected in the initial screening and not being given a feedback for this. But after going through 3 rounds, I dont understand why a feedback  is not provided. It would personally benefit me as an individual to improve myself. "
"J&J could try to respond to all applications, favourable or not, as the applicant spent their time filling up all the answers for the position. I say this because I still have 2 applications from 2016 with no response yet, both sent before this one for Supply Chain Analyst. Thanks"
"J&J could specify why all my applications have been unsuccessful, even for roles I was definitely qualified for."
J&J could set up training projects for candidates before recruitment.
"J&J could informe me about the proces of the application.
 I have not recive any information regarding this position from the day I have aplied to the job..."
"J&J could always give a feedback as to why someone is or is not selected further during the hiring process. This would mean a lot to the applicants, and in the long term, would also be good for J&J as candidates would learn what they can improve or how to properly apply in the future, making it a win win situation."
J&J can reply to the application more quickly and give more chance as son as possible.
"J&J can improve the recruitment process by informing people about their job application submission. 
There is no information about what happenned after submition of CV to your website.
But happy to see that you are looking for feedbacks to improve your process. This is a good way for change.
Kind regards
Samira"
J&J can have questions on the native language of the contry in he seeks employes. And litte bit more of personal/human touch not the robot questions. 
J&J can explain more clearly reasons why the application is refused. 
"J&J can contact me personally and provide feedback, so that I can better target and prepare my application"
J aurais aimé avoir un entretien 
"J & J should personally know the candidates who are doing so, making them conduct field evaluations to actually see the degree of experience for that particular job position."
J & J could answer also with the automatically e-mail when it is not interested at the candidate.
"I’ve gotten five emails concerning the job application process, ‘..we’d like to hear from you..’ and on itself I think it’s good that Johnson & Johnson values the application process. Nevertheless, I believe this should not happen more than once. Anyone looking for a job getting an email reading ‘J&J, we’d like to hear from you’ gets his hopes up.

I´d appreciate a sort of intermediate report on the process.
"It´s important to have feedback...negative or posotive.
Feedback is the way."
"It´s cruzial to give feedback and reasons by why I didn´t be selected for this process, because nobody and any of my recruiter give me my feedback"
Its perfect.
Its all depends on your requirement regardless of the candidate talent. Please try to communicate with the candidates and let them know your stand on the available position
It's the good process. I'm waiting for your call by J&J HR.
it's OK
It's like with other proceses that I did before....It was correctly and soft.
"It's hard to find ""good"" people to work for/with you.
So, when a ""good"" CV comes along, regardless if it is a perfect fit to the job in question, or not, there should be a meeting with this candidate. You never know, this candidate might be the perfect fit for a position other than the one in question. Till now, I have seen only a very single dimensional approach from the recruitment team, cutting off chances and perspectives that could be extremely beneficial to the company and the candidate, as well.
This kind of improvement would be useful."
It's great to have any response from the recruiting company. Even if it's an automatic rejection letter.
"It's difficult for me to comment on this because I never actually interacted with J&J's TA team. I applied for a position (Regional HR Compliance EMEA Manager - 1600133667W), for which I believed I was highly qualified, but received only a rejection email. 

I was a Global HR Policy Manager for 4 years and am now employed by one of your competitors in a similar position in Prague. So, I was quite surprised that my application did not result in - at least - a phone call. 

So, the only feedback I could provide is, perhaps, a review of the systems for reviewing talent.    "
It's bureaucratic and not very open. The applications take more than usual time. No feedback at all. 
It would improve providing the reason why you do not fit the job
"It would have been useful to have received feedback on my application. In addition, I would have liked to have know whether there were any other suitable roles within the organisation."
It would have been nice to receive a more personalised and constructive feedback on the reasons to reject my application. With no feedback there is no room for improvement. 
"It would have been helpful if the recruiter had given me a reason for not being selected. I received the response that I would not be considered within 24 hours of my application, something that is highly unusual given my J&J experience. As a 13 year veteran of J&J who is both multicultural in background and who has developed both powerful insights and accomplishments in the holistic areas of diversity and inclusion, I deserved at least a hearing. The US D&I team has given me this, and the conversation was very productive and positive. "
"It would have been great to receive feedback and get updates after the interviews. Also, the process took a long time and I did not hear from anyone in between which meant that i had to accept a different position because I was unclear about what is going to happen. Even after I took another position at a different company, I never heard any feedback!"
"It would have been better, if the talent community comes up with transparent ways in informing candidates, who look into Organization like J&J as a place to learn and grow that they appreciate the candidate looking for an opportunity with the company and provide reason why their respective candidature is not moved forward.

It would have been appreciable to be contacted directly by one of your recruiter.
"It would be very helpful, as well as a decent thing, if you would provide a reason for the negative response. I have applied for a number of senior finance roles with J&J over the past year, and not once did I receice a reason for not considering my application. I am a very experienced and highly educated finance executive (dual MBA) and would expect this from the HR department of a global company."
"It would be very helpful to know why I was not chosen for the position. I realise that there may be many rejected applicates to contact, but a sentence or two of explanation would make a difference. Maybe I will be perfect fit for a future position Johnson & Johnson!"
"it would be very helpful if you could add a ""review"" function as last step within the application process before the application is submitted. Also, it would be helpful to have the opportunity to upload transcripts of records, letters of recommendation etc. during the application process."
"It would be useful to have some specific feedback, rather than ""We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Commercial Director - North (1600131748W) at Johnson & Johnson Medical Ltd. - fka -Ethicon Ltd."" Ideally it would be good to speak to someone to understand why my background and experience were not suitable. "
It would be tremendously helpful to have a contact persons E-mail or telephone number to contact for updates or to get information why one is no good fit for the position and if there is any chance at all to get the desired job.
"It would be really helpful for the applicants if a brief feedback can be provided for the unsuccessful applications.

Thank you"
"It would be really great to receive some feedback on the application, e.g. what was this in the profile that was not as strong as other candidates etc."
It would be ok to provide a reason why I did not fit for the position I applied to as based on the job requirement I did not see any reason not to be invited for first round of interview.
It would be nice to know why I was not even invited for an interview.
It would be nice to know if I am rejected.
"It would be nice to have something on top of the standard ""thank you but no"" letter. "
It would be nice to have feedback as to why a Candidate is not selected for an interview 
It would be nice to have feedback after the application process
It would be nice to have a one on one discussion with the recruiter to understand why a suitable candidate was not selected. 
It would be nice to have a feedback on why your candidacy was not retained especially after having an interview.  
It would be nice to have a feedback from the recruitment process.
"It would be nice to give the opportunity to everybody, if fits in the position, to participate in the test assessments. I was rejected in the CV's screening phase and I consider that my candidacy was highly competitive, so i was a little bit disappointed. "
"It would be nice to explain with more details the reasons for what the candidate profile´s does not fit with the position. The recruiter reasons used are soo general, so it is difficult to understand what really does not fit. The reasons that gave to me were ""We identify other candidates with a more exact technical profile and/or an experience"". I would like to know what really does not fit with me."
"It would be nice if: 
 - I knew exactly the reason why I had not been chosen (even if it is self-evident).
 - The recruitment team had taken into account my email explaining that some (existing) documents had not been included into the file when the submission / edit period ended unexpectedly "
It would be nice if you do not get standard answers. It seems very unprofessional.
It would be nice if people not being recruited would at least get an email saying why they have not being recruited. But the company is great anyway so the fact that they didn't give me a feedback is not really important to me. I will try to apply again soon. 
"It would be helpful to receive feedback on the second interview a little faster than 10 days if at all possible, but I appreciate these things sometimes can take longer than anticipated."
"It would be helpful to be able to speak to someone about the opportunities Johnson & Johnson might have for me. I am interested in a leading global company like Johnson & Johnson, and am particularly interested in relocating abroad in the long term, something that is a challenge to address without having a recruiter assigned to me.

I may be interested in local positions if this is something that Johnson & Johnson works with employees on.

Thank you! Shannon

It would be helpful if the hiring team could disclose  during the application process on whether the company would assist with obtaining work visa for overseas applicants or if they would entertain applicants who are willing to obtain their own work permit if they were to be shortlisted or chosen for a position.
"It would be great to understand why I am not a good fit for the job , beacuse be this , candidates will know if they have a chance in the future or not. Us as candidates , we exert a high effort in making the application sound and sometimes we take continous training and degrees to be qualified.
We understand that there are huge amount of applicants , but for sure, not a small amount can be ignored or neglected by those automated process , renovation is required to the selection process to ensure fairness to every one.

"It would be great to know the result of the application in a more speedy manner. Also, for someone who is eager to be integrated to the working force in Switzerland, It would be great to know the reason on the declined application for the position and suggestion for future reference. 

Thank you. "
It would be great to get a feedback from the recruiter. In that way the applicant at least knows if his/her profile doesn't match to what you are looking for or if the job position already has been filled in.
It would be great to call the candidates (or send personal email) and inform them that they were not selected for the role after the phone interviews. Automated rejection emails in my point of view discourage those candidates who truly believe in JnJ. Thanks :)
It would be great if you provide a feedback about the application and the reason for not proceeding forward with it so the applicant can take actions to improve. 
It would be great if the talent acquisition team can provide some explanations for not going ahead with your profile. It would be beneficial for the candidates as we can work on our weak areas.
It would be great if the process to reply would not exceed one month. The reply i got for one position took approximately 4 months
"It would be great as Q1 .if you share y u r not fit for perticular position .If he would be knowing , so that candidate can work upon .
& if you provide guidance if some one wants to work some other country . How he can go forward ."
It would be good to understand a cause of failure and to have a possibility of personal meeting with the recruiter.
It would be good to start with the contact with the candidate
It would be good to respond earlier to the application. I am still waiting for an answer from November.
"It would be good to receive some additional feedback on ""why not "" because looking at my experience and background the role fits perfectly."
It would be good to receive feedback about the reason(s) why I wasen't selected.
"It would be good to know, why I am not good enough for the job I applied for."
It would be good to hear why we are not a good fit for the Job from recruiters to improve ourselves.
It would be good to hear the reason why the application hasn't been considered at all. Thank you!
"It would be good to have a phone number, which can be contacted in advance to clarify first questions. Receiving a ""standard reply"" in case of a negative message is somehow boring ..."
It would be good if Johnson and Johnson provides a reason why we don't get an interview. We could improve what we miss like this and provide in future one new application ... which would be positive for the compagny
"It would be better to contact the Person real quick. I didn`t get a response.
I `ve got an answer after contacting Johnson and Johnson .

It would be better if you can tell the reason of rejection.

i.e. Application shortlisted, Rejected or Considering "
"It will be more than important to take some time for explaining the raison, somehow in details for anyone not be chosen on the job opening.

"It will be great to have direct contact more than a simple e-mail. I felt the process too impersonal. Also, I believe that it will be good for J&J to have some potential candidates on the list and leave the door open for any potential opportunity, but personally I felt some disconnection with the candidate."
"It will be great if recruiters reach out to candidates and take time to go over the work experience and reasons why they apply for a given position.  I realize that at times this becomes almost impossible when receiving too many applicants for the same position.  Nevertheless, the personal contact is vital to learn more the applicant than just a resume.  Just a five minutes conversation with those potential candidates could reveal so much information which will help the recruiter identify the best candidate to consider inviting for the interview.  "
it will be good to say the reason of accepting or refusing the employees 
It were video interviews and I never spoke to a recruiter. I think personal interviews are still the best way to get to know each other. You also can't ask questions in a video interview. It was not clear if the video interview needed to be in Dutch or English.
it was very impersonal and transactional.
"It was so cold process for me as a candidate because of not to take face to face interview with anyone from the company.
In my opinion J&J is the most interested company with employees or candidates but not at this time.
I know it's difficult to have face to face interview but at least you can call us and keep in touch and feel people important for themselves.
Thank You.
King Regards."
"It was good at all , may be i saw myself was fitted to the position so they can look more carefully to cvs but the process was very good"
It was fine but I spent a while applying to then be told the branch I was applying to wasn't recruiting. Should've been said before hand
It was a very friendly and pleasant Interview - Thank you very much
"It was a non event.  It consisted of a brief discussion, a void, then vague letter informing me I was not selected.  It was as sterile as a lab."
"It was a faceless and totally cold experience. I've applied twice now and was simply rejected by an automated email. I showed interest in J&J, they showed zero interest in me. Awful."
It took months before I recieved the message that I did not get a job for which I applied. 
It took a long time before I received a response from the organization. 
"It took a few months before I heard anything from J&J and I could not contact the recruiters in any way. It made me doubt that my application did not reach the right person.
After a few months, I received a standard email that I was not selected. This was a standard email, no indication why I was not selected and no possibility to contact someone to receive more information.  
I am still interested to know why my profile does not meet the expectations to go to a second round, thus I would be very grateful to speak to someone from J&J because I can possibly learn from the feedback I would get. My phone number is +32477398937. 
Looking back to the process so far, I fear that I will not get response to the feedback I am giving, however, I hope that I am wrong this time.
many thanks,
Sophie Callebaut "
It takes a very long time to get some information on the posts applied especially if one has applied to multiple posts within the organization
"It should schedule at least a call. I am one of the worldwide leaders in serialization, person that led several implementations and finally created serialization solution that is selected by leading analyst to be one of worldwide 10 leading.

Thus, my belief is that someobe didnt do proper job, or this was just formaly published for known candidate.

It should provide valid justication for not considering the application rather than giving standard statement. It clearly shows J&J is not  showing any intrest towards prospective employees
It should ensure prompt feedback to the candidate in the recruitment process.
It should be morally ethical to tell the prospective hires where they went wrong with their interview and why they weren't chosen other than keeping them in the loop without​ any response with hopes hanging on the thread.
"it should be a interactive one,to all the process..."
it seems to me good enough
"It seems slightly self interested to receive a non explanatory rejection email to a time consuming online application, and then to receive endless emails asking me to complete a recruitment process experience survey.
I had no experience.
None was provided, except the time I spent completing the application, therefore there is very little for me to say to help you improve this process other than perhaps try to focus your survey request emails to people that have actually managed to interact with you organisation.
Kind regards
Mark"
"It seems like I've been unsuccessful with my application as indicated above, yet I have received no communications about this and found out through this survey. "
It seems good enough...
"It needs to be more personal. This distances from people, like talking to robots"
"It might be helpful to explicitly state the preferred requirements, and give examples of profiles that would get picked for an interview. 

Thank you for the opportunity,
Gonçalo"
"it may be complex... but having an idea of how probable a current profile may fit the organization would be welcome.  i'd think that working for j&j would be a superb opportunity for me and that j&j will benefit from my skills and experience.

but if the talent acquisition team believes this will not be possible it would be worth sharing so one could concentrate one's attention in different directions

thanks for listening

It may ask for some questions on Medical & criminal History of candidates.  
It is very long winded and time consuming for those who get near the final point only to find they are unsuccessful in the video interview. 
"It is very helpful when you formulate the reason well, why I do not fit for this position. A simple explanation, or wording ,, we have candidates who fit better for the position,, is very trivial and common.
To know the honest reason why I do not fit for the position gives me at least informations, so that one can improve.
"
It is very fine that you have a dedicated site for recruitment but It would be nice if some human person would contact the candidate after he applied on site and not a cold and impersonal computer interface. 
"It is the second year I apply for a graduate programme and I do not get an answer although I was promised I'd hear from the company whether I had been successful or not. It is very inconsiderate, unfortunately, considering the core values proposed by J&J."
It is supposed to be more interactive. I haven't heard a word from the company do far.
"It is suggested to look closer to CVs. In addition, I sensed the Hr had already decided not to make an offer to me, therefore I am still wondering what was the reason of wasting their and my time. Nevertheless, they did try not be offensive throughout our brief phone conversation. Please note that this was the second (and probably the last) time I applied for a role with J&J - the first time I didn't get any feedback at all."
It is required to check deeply incandidates experiences regardless age or previous employers
"It is not easy to select shortlist candidate form thousands of resumes and it must this candidate have professional certificate to improve company environment , support ethics and internal control but if possible to make phone interview to select shortlist people to give more chance for candidate to select right candidate because some of resume may be not express clearly about candidate.

It is necessary to give possibility to contact the person that is reviewing CV to permit to everyone to track the process directly.

It is important to provide feedback on reasons why you did not get a call at all.
"It is important to provide feedback even if negative.

"It is important to maintain a personal contact with the candidates, to identify the areas where they have above average potential, and to contribute with these characteristics to increase the productivity of the organization. Diversity, and inclusion, makes human capital the most valuable asset of companies."
"It is hard to say, because I am not too well acquainted.  However, I think the process is generally good.  It might make sense to put the name of the person who is the recruiter or hiring manager to ask questions or to know to whom one should address the covering letter.  "

It has been good experience so stay well.
It could provide the reason why the application was not fit for the job required.
"It could employ people in recruitment that can properly assess the level of experience of a candidate. A person with 10 years of experience in senior management roles shouldn't be offered entry level jobs.

"It could be closer, because, for example, it is supossed that i have applied for a job, but for the moment i don't know if I am suitable for that position or not."
It can provide feedback but it is understandable with the large amount of applicants that it is not always possible.
It can be improved by explaining the reason for rejection or acceptance for each  employee .
It can be communicated with detailed reason based on what criteria i was not selected rathdr than saying we have selected somebody. So that if i have missed some skills i develop and get ready for job when it will be recruited again.
It can answer to all applications. And it can explain why an applicant is not a good fit if he/she doesn't fit to the position.

"Introduce a human element, I applied for a role online that I felt my qualifications matched, in fact all of the criteria was met, however I received an automated rejection WITHIN TWO HOURS of my application. I fail to see that my experience was so far apart from the requirements of the role based on the job description."

The interview in my opinion is the best tool to estimate the potential of an applicant for the specified job vacancy, and for future vacancies.

"Interview questions were very repetitive and I felt my answers were not really listened to. The way the questions were asked felt very awkward. The questions also felt very impersonal and I think it would be better if they were actually tailored to the candidates CV and experience as that way you would be able to get to know the candidate better. I felt that my degree and experience were disregarded in the interview.

1 hour was not long enough to prepare well for the presentation, as a perfectionist I was unhappy with such a short time period as it is not possible to prepare a high quality presentation during that time. 

The group task didn't seem to have much of a point and I think it would be better if less time was allocated to preparing for the group task and more for the presentation. 

I was told that I would receive a phone call about the outcome of the assessment day and would be offered feedback. I did not receive a call. "

Interview candidates before you blanketly decided the candidate was suitable or not. In my experience I have years of experience on payroll - got a new job after a week not even called for an interview 
"Interview at least once to:
Review overall experience and compare
Balance overall qualifications and compare
Provide opportunities for senior ex JNJ employees whom know back and forth the company"
"Internal recuitment - with lots of obstacles on the way. Change of position and change of department lead.
Despite this it was an awful process. Of course sorry that I did not get the position, but could for sure have been handled in a better way. From first application until final turndown - 6 month....!
Was send to external assessment without no explanation on what to expect from assessment - was totally unprepared and never recieved any feedback on assessment."
"Instead of sending out a standard rejection, might be an idea to send out something more personal. It is not clear why I was not able to proceed to the next step, although I might have a 100% match with the job requirements. So would be a nice idea to give some more clarity why my job application was declined"
"Instead of general feedbacks for not being selected, actual reason for not going through must be provided.
I understand it is not easy to individually respond to all candidates who apply online, but atleast those who have been exactly matching to requirements, but still do not go through, must be communicated with the actual reason so that they can work upon what needs to be actually required to fit in J&J

Appreciate your support.

"Insert some kind of capability test (on the subject in question) after resume screening to give a real chance to those prepared. 
Also, in my case, the fact that I do not live in the countries of the position might have affected, but that's my next career move and I do not expect any relocation package. I did not have the chance to state that."
Inhabe never been contacted back although I'm a highly qualified minority female engineer.  The online process is too robotic and I don't believe there is ever really a chance for an interview unless you know someone. 
Informing the candidates about the completion of the recruitment process.
Informing an applicant even if not chosen for an interview.
"Information. I applied via corporate website. Then more then 4 week of silence. After that I received during one day 3 mails with a kind request to share my feedback about the recruitment process. :-)

I do think that collecting this feedback to improve J&J NPS is a good idea.

Increase the interaction with the applicants and keep them informed on the progress. Provide the feedback even if the application is not successful because sometimes I do not receive any feedback and I totally forget about the application after a month.
"Increase number of face to face interview,

CV only is not enough to choose the best qualified person."
Include some case study to filter right candidates or invite for a sample assignment and then shortlist candidates for further scrutiny. Mere bio-data can be inadequate to evaluate experts and talents.
Include a point of contact for job-specific questions.
"In the recruitment process, besides the CV Upload, the RH should make a preview interview by phone and just after that, decide to proceed or not with the recruitment.

I also think that the trainies opportunities should be also for professionals that whant to change careear and learn the methodes / bases of the company.

Some professionals didn`t have the opportunity to do that while were students, but should have as professionals.

The company should look to the potencial and not only for the CV.

The candidate never knows if the CV reaches to the RH, if he evaluates clearly the CV."

"In my view (and others working at J&J, not in the HR department), HR puts too much weight on the assessment. Instead of seeing the assessment as a guidance, they take it as a pass/fail, without first explaining what they are looking for during the assessment (and what you should show) and without giving a chance to have feedback on the assessment.
I had multiple opportunities to demonstrate my ability to collaborate with other people and showed this in interviews, references and resume, while the assessment concluded that collaboration was my weak spot and HR takes such things as an absolute truth."
"In my specific experience,
- after having made all efforts to be interviewed, despite an initial refuasal from HR
- after having also provided internal reccomendations from ex colleagues coming from SABMiller and working in J&J, all extremely positive, coming from different grades
- after having had three good (in my opinion) interviews
- after having also being transparent about the interview process happening in another company, saying my first preference was in any case J&J

I got the shocking feedback that J&J would not proceed with my application as they think I am not motivated enough....

It sounds like a joke, right?

"In my point of view, nothing more is necessary.

"In my point of view, firstly they have to make the informations more shortly and briefly.

And applicants could understand by themselves that they would be eligible for this opportunity or not.  After 1st stage then they can put more and more information and ask their requirements.  In this way non-eligible people can realize themselves and you will not face many meaningless or with another word not corresponding applicants. "

"In my opinion, applying via linkedin profile had ease the process. To make it perfect, after application, when you are sending mail about if the candidate is matching or not, informing about why s/he is not suitable  will be perfect feedback. Thanks"
"In my opinion,
It would be nice to know at all times how you are going in the process.
Synthesizing interviews, joining departments"
"In my opinion Johnson & Johnson is doing well in making quick decisions (I received my rejection in a quite short time)

BUT rejections with standard texts are not really friendly or helpful. The argumentation in my case was that you go on in the process with people who are even closer to the requirements you need. And this I do not believe! "
In my opinion J&J should meet candidates to better evaluate them.
In my opinion J&J recruitment process is very professional.
In My opinion J&J can shorten the Period of Interview process and improve the communication to the applicants.Thanks.
"In my opinion it was perfect. Although everyone was very busy, I felt care for."
In my opinion it is a great practice when hiring managers send a feedback to the candidates regarding why they were not selected for the particular position and what they could improve for the future applications.
In my opinion everything was good. I get the response by email with an explanation in a reasonable time. Good service. 
"In my modest opinion, if it can contribute to the possible change of recruitment: it does not work, the approach is tiring and it is not productive nor does it offer the candidate the concept of humanism.

In Giving a feedback following a negative response

"if the position will be covered internally it's better not publish it to the public.
moreover, the candidate resume/cv is made to give a hint or a brief about the applicant.
So the candidate is able to do the job if the resume match the position criteria.
unfortunately its always a negative reply from the HR.
an enhancement to the filtration process must be done."
"If the persons background experience is not what is required then that person should not have been called for interview.
The feedback could have been a lot better."
"If the job vacancies are preferably given to internal staff, they shouldn't be displayed in for external audiences."
If the candidate is not fit the position then maybe just send the automatic mail to tell candidate and leave a contact to let the candidate ask why they are not chosen. This is win-win situation. J&J gets good reputation and the candidate also more clear the policy or the needs of J&J.

"if no, respond at least with the typical generic email and not ask for surveys that are the Only Proof that you were rejected"
"If HR be so kind to reply to the candidates whether positive/negative, that will enhance the recruitment process. I believe, not responding to the candidates show the value given to the people in J&J. Although most ""powerful"" companies tend to ignore most of the applications so thought to be ""weak"" to them; those may be the greatest ones that the company may have missed to recognize. I doubt this comment will take into consideration, yet, I hope someone will take it seriously. Regards."
"If candidates take the time to apply in person, I do consider that it is appropriate for a person to take the time to respond as opposed to an automated message. I believe I was a good fit for the position, and it would have been very beneficial to receive a proper feedback in regards to as why my qualifications did not match what you were looking for."
"If application is not considered, it must be sent with one rationale. This will help candidate to know his limitations and he can further strenghthen his improvement areas. If any position is for particular region only then it will be good if portal will not allow to apply. It will be great save of time. "
"if an applicant did not meet the requirements, it would be better that they are contacted and advice in what to improve would in order to be successful on the second try"
"If a person with sufficient qualification and international work experience apply for any position it means he/she has some additional qualification then I would like to suggest the recruitment team to provide a feedback either by email or telephonically. This is my personal experience as I had applied a number of positions but didn't get any feedback. I don't know about your screening procedure but I think you are loosing real talent with this system. 

Johnson & Johnson is name that I heard since I was 4-5 years old and I have an extremely good image because of its products. I have good experience and qualification but didn't heard back for at least even a single time.

Good luck for your talent search.

I'm not sure how the recruitment is carried out at johnson&Johnson. I had a degree in chemical engineering and a masters in pharmaceutical engineering aswell as work experience . I was still rejected straight away after the application which seems very unfair. There should be online tests and video interviews to judge the candidates better so overall I think the recruitment process is poor.

"I'm awake of the high number of applications received by J&J; anyway, I think the recruiters should have a short telephone interview with all the candidates. Only after this short preliminary interview, they should select the candidates, and provide to the not selected ones some reasons of their exclusion. In my opinion, each candidate has something to ""communicate"" further his schematic and rational CV. I agree with the idea according to which the oral communication is considerably more efficient than the written one, especially when people have to be evaluated not only for their academic or work experience profile, but also for their transversal skills, such as smartness.

It's not the way to live up our Credo values from an employee development perspective.

"I'd like to have more datails about the recrutment process. In particular a feedback about the reason why i don't fit the position i was candidated for.
I'm really interested about your company and i would like to have some suggestions about the way to start a career in you company. I would appreciate the opportunity to introduce myself during an interview "
I'd have liked to have some feedback from the recruiters 
I would think that a company as large as yours would look at an individual's skill set and invite them in for an interview to see if they might fit in a different area other than the one they applied for.  I was given no invitation just a form letter stating that I didn't have the necessary skills required for the position.  How would they know that if they never bothered to ask me?  I interviewed hundreds of people during my years as the VP of Operations at 3 different companies.  I guess your company would prefer someone who has a degree in HR rather than someone who can evaluate talent.  I wish your company success.  I know that your reputation as an above average company was not seen by this individual.  That's too bad because I would have enjoyed helping your company to further it's goals.
"I would suggest, to give job seekers call and give them a reason, why they are not been selected.... 

I really want to work for J&J.

Hope to hear from you soon"
"I would suggest providing a feedback to people that were not a good fit. However, I perfectly understand that due to the huge amount of applications you cannot provide a personal feedback, but if there were some general possible reasons for every one-like why you might have been rejected and etc, would be very useful I reckon. "
"I would strongly suggest to rework the Human Resources process, as screening resume through IT systems is really not the best to be Human ! :)

I would like to kindly say that the best way to be in touch nowadays for any hiring process is to know someone within the company where you applied.

To illustrate, the best example is the Whatsapp founder, who tried so much time to be hired by Facebook. Finally, he set-up his innovative service, that Facebook bought million $ few years after... "
I would strongly recommend to give a short call to the candidate who applied for the position - even he/her not be the right fit for the applied role. 
"I would say that the recruitment process would improve vastly if there will be a knowledge and skills assessment test during application. This way, all applicants will have a fair chance at the recruitment process as evaluation will not merely be based from the CV but will be from the combination of CV points and assessment points.

In reality, profiles can be deceiving. Just because one applicant has the most number of years of experience does not always mean that he/she is the most fit for the job. Similarly, if one does not have long years of experience, it does not make him/her less qualified for the job.

More experience, more skills, fit for the job.
Less experience, less skill, not fit for the job.
More experience, less skills, not fit for the job.
Less experience, more skills, fit for the job.

It could go either ways (as above) with conventional recruitment process as it does not involve applicant's skills assessment, and is merely based on CV. Potential candidates can be missed and discounted.

     "
"I would recommend to write at least the candidate a personal mail with a reason, why he does not fit for the position. "
I would recommend to send an email alert when any change happens on your website applications. 
"I would recommend more prescreening questionnaire that would be the first flash to the recruiter and the candidate if he /she is a good fit or not ( it will gives the recruiter quick score prescreening , in addition would let the candidate wiegh him/herself ).
Also, the system update will be great , I'm one of the candidates who oftenly visist their profile and would like to know the status of my application.

further , status would be more effective and provide guide line to candidates ,the developing point such as over qualified , didn't meet position base line , extra ... 

I'm quite sure such will need some effort from internal recruiter , however it will take the company to the next level not only hiring ppl but also guiding them .

Also this will obligate recruiter to be more honest with candidates.

eventually , thanks for taking such initiative to take my opinion into consideration 

"
I would recommend a feedback about hy we are not the chosen person for that job.
"I would not say I went through any recruitment process. I applied for the role, it very shortly after that disappeared from the website and I never heard another thing for about 6 months when I got a standardised  email confirming I was unsuccessful. I know J&J value their talent from working there but this definitely was not reflected in this experience "
I would like to understand exactly where I am not meeting your criteria. On one application I was rejected in less than a few hours! Do you for example have a screening criteria for example where you have a preference for those working in the pharmaceutical industry? 
I would like to receive clear feedback on the selection process and be informed about future open positions in recpect to my scope of skills and experience.
"I would like to receive as soon as possible a positive/negative feedback. Generally, you do not receive it."
"I would like to receive  more details about my result and what I can improve.
It is very important to me to strive after perfection.
Recruiters told me that level of competitors was very simillar.
I would like to know where is  the difference between us?"
I would like to know why my profile didn't was choosen to the next process of the recruitment. I still think I would be a good option.
I would like to know the reasons why i was not a good fit for the position i applied to.
"I would like to have more personal contact with a employee, it was very impersonal! "
I WOULD LIKE TO GET DETAILED FEEDBACK ON MY JOB APPLICATION AND TO HAVE FACE TO FACE MEETING TO PROVIDE MY EXPERIENCES.
"I would like to get a specific feedback from the recruiter.
I got an automatic answer 1 hour after I submitted my application.
The only reason I can speculate from this quick answer is my nationality.
Otherwise I would have received a specific answer."
"I would like to comment on one thing: I have been preselected many times for the position of MSL at J&J. Once, I was called for the interview, but since I was working and unable to talk, I asked the HR person to call me back in 30 minutes, which I was assured to be no problem. 
I never received the call again. I was trying to reach the person, left the message on voicemail, but she never called me back.
Even though I understand how busy the Talent aquisition people are and that the amount of candidates is enormous, I find this kind behaviour unprofessional.
I am more than sure that I would be the great match both for the position of MSL and for J&J Company. I have many friends working in J&J, who encourage and recommend me for the job of MSL, therefore I was hoping to at least be invite for the interview, where I could convince the J&J Team to be a perfect candidate that they are looking for.
"
"I would like to be part of J&J, I have never got any opportunity. I looking forward if I could be given a chance to prove my self.

Thanks"
I would like to be contacted if a similar position arises
I would like somebody to call me and to give me the chanxe to attend the interview. It is obvious that they choose a back door influence person without any interview in the Romanian market.
I would like recieve the reason pf why im not qualified to check were i am
I would like a real feedback. 
I would improve the recruitment process suggesting what was wrong with the application of the candidate
I would have preferred an interview in person instead of a video conference. 
"I would have liked to receive a feedback from the hiring manager and not from someone who was not present at the business case (last interview) and couldn't clearly explain the reasons why I was not a good fit for the position (the HR person did her job well, just it was a in-direct feedback). Many thanks anyway to everyone involved in the recruitment process for the time dedicated to me. Still looking forward to another opportunity to join J&J. "
"I would have liked to have an appraisal of the interview, which will take me forward for future interviews. It was a discrepancy between job description and expectation about skills in the second interview."
I would have liked to be called as was promised. I still haven't heard back from you about the offer I got in your initial phone call. 
I would have liked some kind of contact - I have had none
"I would have gladly worked for you. Also in another location. In the field or Office. As I've been busy with your company, I loved you. Maybe you have Yes a different position for me.It's a pity that you do not know the reason why you did not get the position. Also I would like to improve myself. I can do this but only with positive criticism. It would be nice to hear from you. It would be great if you had a job for me.
Yours sincerely
Achim Stoll"
"I would have appreciated to have received a feedback, although I also understand that it would be extremely difficult to provide this information to all candidates."
I would have appreciated to be invited for an interview. 
"I would have appreciated more specific reasons why my application was not considered. This would have helped me to improve my application file and told me the areas where I can excell more.
I still hold J&J as a highly recommended employer."
"I would have appreciated having a prompter feedback and most importantly receive a personal contact. Your assessments are hard job and there is high emotional involvment and expectations with the Company .
Thanks "
I would have appreciateappreciated to get feed back about the reasons for which I was not successful in this recruitment process. 
"I would be happy if the recruiter can contact or email the reason why I was not successful for the role. 
This can improve my job search and broaden my knowledge. 
Although, I understand there must be more applicants for this role.

"I would be fairly understandable over my application status if I could receive a email from the Johnson & Johnson recruiter to provide a specific reason why I were not a good fit for the position I applied, rather than just an general email do not specify a detailed reason which many firms are now practicing so. Being as one of candidates I don't think that we would be contented or understandable over our applications. "
I would appreciate to receive more detailed feedback about why the candidate is not a good fit for the position.
I would appreciate to participate in interview or join the company.
"I would appreciate more transparency on the hierachical recruitment rules for this application. E.g. preference for candidates already in EMEA HR network, independent of level of expertise?"
I would appreciate if you would provide a reason why I'm not a good fit to increase my chance on a permanent employment 
"I would appreciate if the reason is provided why I was not a fit for the position. I am currently a project manager and have noticed that even after applying for different levels of positions, I was not selected including lowest associate role, manager and even senior management positions. Hence, I believe that the issue is probably regarding the sponsorship of the candidates even though they are well qualified and experienced. It would be better if it is clearly mentioned for the positions, that the organisation cannot provide sponsorship as I totally understand that there are some limitations. Since, huge amount of valuable time is invested while searching and applying for jobs, the least thing to do is to mention the reason for not selection. I receive responses as not being selected without reason and please keep applying for jobs, which gives an impression of ignorance. Request you to please improve this process, as a strong and potential candidate it should not give a bad opinion about the whole organisation. Thank you"
I would appreciate if feedback would have been give for what reason I have not been considered.
"I would appreciate constructive feedback on my application and recommendations on how to become a better candidate in the future for Johnson & Johnson. Also, a reason for being rejected would be wonderful to receive as I should know what to improve. "
I would advise to improve the feedback provided for applicants.
I worked with Janssen on contract for approximately two and a half years. During that time I achieved significant success in growing the business - 43% growth with Caelyx and strong growth with Xeplion. I had the support and recommendations from my line managers to pursue a full time roles within the Johnson and Johnson organisation. I find it very strange that having achieved my successes to date by adhering to the Janssen Credo. I have not even been called to interview. My experience of the recruitment process has therefore been very disappointIng.
I worked for ethicon for over 12 years until i was made redundent i enjoyed my time with ethicon i am trying to get to work with ethicon as it is a very good company to work for i am working in care as i cant get the same type of work 
"I worked as Quality Inspector at Embraer S.A. for 9 years certifying the correct process of machining, stamping and assembly of sub-assemblies of parts in composite and aluminum as well as certification of dynamic tests and assemblies of avionics systems.
I worked in the Santa Casa de Misericórdia Hospital in São José dos Campos - SP as a maintenance technician where it was necessary to certify the correct functioning of the surgical instruments.
I undertook an engineering internship at the Swissbras injection molding and plastic molding company where I cataloged all the polymers to be placed in the machines and made process control charts for the Quality sector to ensure that the best process guaranteed more quality parts."
I withdrew my application so I didn't go through the process and wan not needed to be contacted by TA

I wish that Johnson&Johnson has more opportunities for newly graduated people. All available job posts are indicated that experience is required for the positions. There might be a program for only new graduated to find employees who are inexperienced but talented. There might be an exam or interview process to give them opportunity to be part of Johnson&Johnson.
"I will request you to please share the feedback to the people who are applying to the job opening in your esteemed organisation. I have applied to many open positions in your company which was exact match with my profile.

However I haven't heard anything back from your end. I am very eager to join your company and can relocate to any place with a good profile.

Please provide me with a feedback if my profile is not shortlisted. Your website also don't show whether the profile is shortlisted or rejected.

Please respect the people who are applying for the job in your company."
"I will never work for J & J period.

After all the test, double screening, analytical, financial testing, twice being interviewed with J&J, then the great silence come and nobody is answering my emails. Not even a courtesy call, or an email to tell me that the position has been filled, closed... etc.
What a shame, for a company with  a reputation like Johnson and Johnson to treat its perspective employees. It's just a part of a big corporate machinery that has interest only in profits. Its that what the interview process was telling me? When ""Thank you"" and please don't bother to send me surveys anymore. "
I will like Johnson & Johnson to exploit more talented job seekers from Africa and as well as also giving them the opportunity to develop and grow in their area of specialization.
"I went through the online application, then the online interview, then I was invited to the group interaction day. From there I was invited to Vistakon Limerick by the talent aquisition associate Marian Cormack. There I was interviewed by David O'Driscoll.
Since then I have never been contacted by anyone. I emailed twice and got a response from Marian saying she ""contact me in a day or two"".
Six months later and no response. I followed up with a phone call as I was keen to get feed back on my performance and how I could improve.
I find it quite unacceptable that a large organisation would treat any individual in this manner. I wouldn't normally name personnel but behaving in this manner is disgraceful.  "
"I went through 2 interviewing processes with JnJ, and in the first case I got feedback after 2 months and in the 2nd case I never received any feedback at all. It would be great if the overall recruitment process would be faster, or in case of not being the right candidate profile, the feedback should be given in a timely manner (i.e. within 1-2 weeks after interviews).
I am quite disappointed that I received no feedback after the interview for this role, even if I tried to contact via email/ LinkedIn/ phone both the HR contact and the hiring manager. I must say my image and expectations of JnJ  were higher... "
I wasn't contacted from o recruiter but through J&J career portal 
"I was very sorry that JnJ decided to decline my application in first round. I think my fit with the job requirements was solid and I expected to be st least interviewed by somebody. What a pity, especially for your company"
I was very impressed with the process
"I was very happy with the whole recruitment process. I appreciate short response time and keeping of the agreed terms. 
I also appreciate very professional and friendly approach of the recruitment consultants. "
I was upfront said a no without any further processing of my application. I think its very imporatnt for such a big company to atleast give an oppourtunity of screening the candidates in the first place and then decide. So basically i didnt really go through any recruitment process. 
"I was thinking I am the good choice for the recruitment and I had a reference for this application. But for all that, I didn't get any feedback about my application. 
Ethically it is necessary to return to all candidates, but it is not necessary to return the candidates after this survey.

Thank you."
"I was so excited by the possibility of working for Johnson and Johnson. I did a great deal of research into the organisation and spoke to many people who worked there to get their advice and opinions. Everybody's feedback was great which is why I applied for the graduate scheme. 
However, the recruitment process was appalling and really disappointed me. After working really hard to get through each round to the video interview, I was shocked that I wasn't even emailed to be told if I was successful or not at this stage. I understand the graduate schemes at J&J are highly competitive but grads who work so hard to get through each round at least deserve to know if they have been successful or not. I emailed the recruitment team on two separate occasions to ask about my application as I had been weeks/ months and I had not heard anything. I still to this day have no received a response.  
For a company who's Credo is centred around caring I have been really disappointed by the lack of care shown by J&J. "
"I was satisfied, and a recruiter proposed me several time slots for the interview."
"I was rejected within an hour of applying.
You sent me 3 of the same email for this survey"
"I was really intereated to join such community and i thought that with my diverse experience i can easily adapt and find my self in a job where i reach my satisfaction but i was actually disappointed when i only received an email stating that i am not accepted without stating the reasons.
"
"I was really excited to apply to Johnson & Johnson and still think that is an excellent company with great corporate culture. However I was really disappointed to never hear from a recruiter. I think that when people are spending a lot of time for an application process the company has at least have to notify the applicants about its decision. I respect the company's decision, but I really think that they should have let me know, and hope that in the future they let the applicants know about their decision no matter what the outcome is."
"I was put through to the online test and never received an email as to whether I was successful or not, let alone any constructive feedback. I have just had to assume I was not successful in progressing to the next stage of the application."
"I was promised feedback regardless of the outcome of the assessment day and feel this would be a really useful part of the process but after 2 months I still have not been given feedback, just a rejection notice. I have followed up on trying to get my feedback numerous times but after several proposed days for a phone conversation the call has never materialised. This is really frustrating for me as I can't know what to improve on for future job opportunities and seems unfair after all the effort I put in to attend the assessment day and perform to the best of my ability. I had liked the look of Johnson & Johnson after my assessment day but the poor follow up/not fulfilling of promises has tarnished my impression notably. "
"I was only interviewed by one recruiter who from my assessment already had his preferred candidate but just wanted to speak to me in other to make the interview appear as if it is following due processes. The interviewer did not ask me any work based questions.
I will advise Johnson & Johnson to please try and make their recruitment process a bit fairer in order to accommodate people from minority ethnic race and group. It is laughable that for the position  i applied for there was just only one recruiter who obviously did not like my face and did not see any reason continue the interview process.
Johnson & Johnson should in the near future have a panel of judges to decide who is fit for a job during the interview stages."
I was only contacted a year after my application without any update before. This was to notify me that I was not selected. I find this quite late and actually also very rude. 
"I was not informed of Johnson & Johnson's decision until I emailed repeatedly to enquire. I was also sent this survey without any indication of the status of my application.  
In addition, the application was very slow and I was not regularly updated. "
I was not informed about the recruiting process itself. Just heard from another person that the position is no longer available. I was not contacted for an interview os something else.
"I was not even contacted with anyone I just received a no reply email saying we regret to inform you your application won't be processed , I applied online . 

So I am very surprised to even being choose to do a survey around the recruitment process in J&J"
"I was not even contacted by the recruiter.
I received an automatic rejection. I don't think that my CV/Profile was even looked at or screened

"I was interviewed for the position on 17th February'2017. However, I was never told by person who organised my interview that I wasn't selected for the position. I had done summer internship and had some contacts and I guess because of that at least I got to know some one else had already started. It would be useful if the recruiter contacts the candidate at least within 3 weeks regarding their decision."
"I was interviewed for J&J about two months ago in Prague, and I was very dissatisfied with the recruitment process.

Initially, I didn't plan to fill in any survey, but as I find it in my mailbox every other day (and I didn't sign for your e-mail updates!), I'll finally fill it in.

First of all, the HR lady was late for the interview (ok, like 2-3 mins, but still).

Second, she asked too personal questions during the interview.
(""Why did you come to Prague?"").

Third, the position was supposed to be entirely in English, and she interviewed me in Czech most of the time (which I have no problems with, however this is not professional).

Also, she never got back to me after the interview (until I sent her an e-mail asking whether they hired somebody else or I should still expect her reply).

Last, but not the least. After she replied that they decided to hire somebody else, I asked in a very polite way what the reason for not hiring me was, what the areas that she thinks I should improve in are. Well, she didn't reply to my e-mail.

I find the recruitment process in Prague to be organized in a very poor and ignorant manner. 

You should find another HR lady as she might be the reason you're loosing good candidates."
"I was informed the morning of the interview that instead of a 1-1 interview there would be 2 more interviewers present. this doesn't give long to prepare. Also it didn't seem to give them much time as there was no clear questions/structure to the interview. I understand every interview is different, but this was awkward. especially as I got different answers from each person to the same question. i..e number of markets/websites covered. number of languages etc.   I would very much like the opportunity in the future to work for J&J as I respect fully the culture and admire the Credo and sincerely hope this interview does not prevent future opportunities."
"I was informed that the recruitment for the position is on hold so I did not even started the recruitment process. 
Therefore I was wondering why the company continues to send me survey's requests provided that there is still no process..."
I was ill at first interview. Afterthat recruitment didn't continue 
I was expecting at least a phone call from HR department when hiring such important position. While interviewing the candidate the HR manager could take into a account also information which might not be included in CV or cover letter due to the required length of both of the documents. Because of that you might loose highly motivated and enthusiastic people just because of lack of time (?) or enthusiasms of your HR managers. 
"I was employed by Johnson and Johnson as a Summer Student at LifeScan Scotland during the summers of 2014, 2015 and 2016 with the intention of applying for the Graduate Scheme at this site. 

I applied for this role in early October as I had been made aware by HR partners who ran the graduate programmes that visited the Inverness site whilst I was there, that this would be when the application process would open. 

I then did not hear back from J&J until mid-December, when they notified me that in fact this scheme was no longer running. The only alternative to this I was offered was to apply for the other graduate scheme with DePuy, which I knew was an engineering based scheme that would not be suitable for me with a life science background. 

My previous experiences with recruitment processes at Johnson and Johnson were very different and it is disappointing that this has been the case this time around. "
"I was emailed a rejection a year later when I had absolutely no interest in the role anymore. 
Excellent company and would love to have worked there, but awful process "
"I was disappointed to not here back either way after spending my weekend preparing for the tests I was asked to complete. I was also disappointed to not get any further based on a psychometric test in which you had to Rate 3 options, all of which were important, and a numerical reasoning test which didn't really have any relevance to the job. Overall a disappointing process from a company I had previously highly rated. "
"I was disapointed to learn that the position got cancelled. I did not see JnJ as a company posting jobs thoughtless, knowing their credo's.

"I was contacted by a recruiter and was informed I was no longer considered for the position in question. However, I was never informed as to the reason."
"I was conscious of not having the best fit per experience for the posiiton, maybe providing a few more details or advices to candidates (what to improve to better fit) might be helpfull"
I was called in inapropriate time and the connection was bad. Couldn't sustain conversation due to bad connection.
I was called for telephonic interview and she mentioned that she would like to go to next step but then got no response.
I was asked to provide a cv and contact details and then never heard anything at all!
I was asked by your recruiters to look at and apply for finance jobs. I submitted my CV for those which seemed relevant to my background. I received a standard email saying I was not chosen for interview. Giving more direct feedback would be most useful so I don't continue applying for positions and get rejected.

I was amazed that i was a perfect fir for job into J&J when your outsourcing partner connected with me and wanted me to join them and work for you. But when i connected with J&J directly suddenly my resume is not even worth an interview . Something sketchy is going on in your Org with your outsourcing partner and HR.
"I want to see an explanation why I don't fit this job's requirements. I have many internships and creative knowledge. I don't want to judge from test system. If I was observed from my communication and social skills, I was seen successful and maybe have chance to get this job. But system classify us for requirements about job. I'm new graduate, but I know that I handle all kinds of job's requirements, if I have chance to be applied. I understand that there are millions of candidates and you should choose only one candidate which is perfect for you. But I think that firms should focus on social, creative skills. EQ is more important than IQ or mathematical knowledge for marketing jobs. "

"I use to see JnJ as a big reputable name and dreamt to work for but over the years my opinion has changed. The organisation is completely unfair, HR and management will only hire the people they already know. There is no concept of giving an experienced external talent a chance. Disgusting, because I've was trying for a job at JnJ for last 5 years. "
"I uploaded the wrong document.  No matter what I did, I could not replace the document I uploaded.  I even tried to back out of the process, tried to restart the process, but the system always took me back to the same place with the wrong documented uploaded.  As a classmate/friend of Alex Gorsky, I was hoping to tell him that I was a candidate, successful or unsuccessful, within his organization.  Though extremely excited about the position, and feeling like I was extremely qualified for the role having already help an equally important role for 4 years in this region, I will never know what happened with that document.   One final comment, the initial survey asks about business fluency in particular languages.  I am conversationally fluent in German and there is no category that demonstrates how quickly someone can get up to speed with business fluency.   Disappointed in the lack of clarity in the process."
"I understand you receive a lot of applications and know it is difficult to provide detailed feedback to every candidate. However, I found the response email blunt and impersonal which has influenced my impression of the company. I don't feel the generic response approach portrays the company ethos. 
"
"I understand there would have been lot of applications for the positions. I applied for the first time for the 2 Finance roles based in Dubai. Having an experience in one of the leading global pharma organization for the senior director role. I have not been contacted to discuss in detailed about my exposure and what I can bring to contribute to the success of J&J. 
I suggest to enhance the process to review the application deeply.  "
I understand the number of applications is considerable but would be great to review the candidate profile in details before taking decisions to move forward or to stop. I believe that I was more than qualified for the role and the assessment was not done in an appropriate way.  
"I understand that the large volume of applications received might make it difficult to contact every applicant.  However, where possible the gesture would be much appreciated. 

Thank you for seeking the feedback.  My positive opinion of J&J was reinforced by this process. 

Regards,
Nandu"
"I understand that the amount of people who apply for positions in a big company as J&J could be huge, but it would be really helpful to receive feedbacks when not selected in order to improve the application in the future.   "
"I understand that it may be tough to provide an in-depth feedback for any candidate, however since you want to get the most for any application, as candidate, I'd like to get the same. Therfore, I would like to receive your feedback on the reasons why my profile did not fit the position for which I applied. Thanks for any time you will spend on this."
"I understand that every company has their ways, but the video interview was very surreal for me. Even though I felt I had given enough time for preparation, reading off and talking to a computer rather than another human was needlessly stressful "
I thought that I were qualified for this role however I didn't get any reason for why I'm not a good fit for the position I applied to. 
"I though tthe recruitment process was highly vague. This is mainly due to the fact that the response was very delayed, as well as the reason given for the non-selection was a very generic one."
"I think,the HR officer need more careful about candidate and give more importance for Cv selection process.Sometimes they do mistake to select right  candidate."
"I think, J&J should invite candidates for position, maybe canditates can impress them, or they can explain reasons more clearly."
"I think, I have not receive any kind of information regarding recruitment process from you so far. Please check your records.

It is a bit awkward to receive invitation for survey as a first contact from company one sent application for a job.

All the best - Monika Szczęsna

"
I think you to minimize the time interval between application and interview/ short listing.Secondly give brief instruction to  graduate candidate to proceed in particular area according to their profile and give equal opprotunity to graduate candidate also.
"I think you need to make a questionnaire as an application for the applicant to be submitted with the CV , this questionnaire gives you full information on behalf of interview.

Thank you for this survey.

"I think you could give people more information about the recrutment process, about people's candidacy, and above all, give the chanche to people from other areas, that are applying to show themselves.
thank you very much. "
I think we were kind of mixed up wit the position but the manager was overall kind and describe the hole supply chain and the position 
I think to improve the recruitment process is to make more specific questions about the skills and educations that take every people.
I think this way how  Johnson & Johnson doing  is right way
"i think they should treat applicant in better way , at least respond to them with no and tell them why they are not accepted "
I think they should interview the persons before they decide anything. 
I think there was an error and I did not receive answer to my revised submition.   I am resident in Europe and it seams like LinkedIn informed something else.    I can set residence in France and be electable for the job.   Was that the barrier please confirm.   a.Marco.salas@Gmail.com 
I think the recruitment process should be much easier for candidates. It should be shorter so that an applicant could fulfill it easily.
"I think the recruitment process is very correct, since there is not always a reply or feedback from the companies we apply for. Therefore, I have a very good opinion from Johnson&Johnson.
To improve the recruitment process, I would say to provide feedback to the candidate about why he/she has not been chosen for the vacancy, although I understand this would be very time consuming."
I think the recruitment process could be improved if the recruiters provided the reasons why the candidate were not a good fit for the position they applied to.
"I think the recruitment process at J&J is not as good as it could be.  The recruitment team seems very keen to place a square peg in a square hole.  I am very keen to join J&J and been willing to lower my salary expectations to broaden my experience and work in Johnson and Johnson to experience working in a different type of role or gain different experience.  Looking through the company's credo I would have thought J&J would be open to an application on this basis but from my experience of the UK recruitment team this does not seem to be the case; they have told me in the past that I am ""over qualified"" based on my previous salary, rather than my previous experience. I did really want to work with J&J on the basis of the company's ethos and credo but I can see from my personal experience that the recruitment team and hiring managers are more concerned with hiring someone who ticks the right boxes to make sure that their backs are covered, which basically shows me that J&J is not the employer I thought they were.  I may still pursue a career at J&J but I will be pursuing opportunities on an opportunistic basis rather than as an employer of choice, which was previously the case."
"I think the recruiter procesos is very professional and I am happy to be inform about  why in this time I was not selected for the vacancies.

By other hand I would like you can integrate a video call, and might be as for some certifieds or any evidence to give us more chance to be considerate. 

Please, just here in Mexico I would like to see more jobs to apply.

Thank you so much.
Kind Regards.
"
I think the process is already efficient. I received a reply (that is not common nowadaysi) within a short time.
I think the process interview was really good because of the study cases and interaction with other candidates I really enjoyed the experience and the opportunity that Johnson & Johnson gived me.
"I think the HR department to give chances to applications, which in some extents match the requirement of the vacancies announced by J&J. The HR department should not judge the applications based on CVs and cover letters, because someone may copy the CV from some sites and prepare very good and professional CV and cover letter while the said person will be not qualified for the position and selecting the said person will waste J&J valuable time.

so, it is requested to give chance to other qualified candidates as well.

Thanks"
"I think the first step to improve recruitment process is to contact with survey, like now, and contact by personal interview. With this two steps cover the process recruitment process more information about candidates, and to allow to Johnson & Johnson to increase the quality of selection."
"I think the employee who responsible for recruitment process did not read my resume.


I asked a lot of my friends in pharmaceutical field inside and outside J&J 
All of them told me that, the position is blocked for someone by name and this is fake process. "
I think the application process is quite straightforward. Some more constructive feedback to applicants will be useful though in future.
"I THINK THAT YOUR SHOULD GIVE REASONS  IF THE PERSON WAS ACEPTED OR NO , BECASUSE SOMETIMES WE ARE WAITING FOR THE ANSWEAR AND NEVER WE HAVE THE FINAL RESULTS. 
THANKS"
"I think that your recruiment process is working great, so big improvements are needed."
"I think that you can give us more confident when the interested are of another country like my case, sometimes i think that we don't have opportunity.

Regards and thank you so much for the opportunity.
"
"I think that they should recruit directly, with an international( European ) HR department.
Locally ( e.g. Bucharest ), they set these vacancies for certain persons 
"
"I think that the process is too automated and using only matching systems you may lose the chance to meet very valid candidates. The votes, age is just numbers"
"I think that the process is good, but even if I applied for several positions I've never had the occasion to be interviewed. 
May be too informatic system filters oriented?"
I think that the company have to meet the candidate. The people is more than a curriculum vitae
"I think that the best way is to have a face to face contact.
Frankly speaking, this is what I would like it happen to me."
I think that Johnson & Johnson should give the possibility to make in person job interview so Johnson & Johnson can really understand the personal and professional characteristics of the candidates
I think that Johnson & Johnson have the right HR for plane the correct recruitment process.
I think that J&J should open more jobs opportunities and to bet more in trainnes programs but accepting more candidates
"I think that J&J should focus more attention to candidate's motivation and their reasons for applying for a particular position. I also believe that would be good to assess candidates with a logic test using a web tool to screen the number of applications. In my personal experience I think that there is more to investigate rather than looking just at job titles in a CV. I managed very interesting projects in the pharma industry in my actual position, but I have not had the chance to share this experience with the recruiter."
"I think that is very important for the encouragement of the candidates, to know the exact reason to decline the candidacy. It´s will be a good way to continue improving in future processes"
"I think that as a great society, many resumes sent go unnoticed, bisognaerebbe, if not already in use should have a system to insert the candidates the skills the years and everything you need to make sure to contact them when there is a new requirement , I try to be more time, but I never received any request for interview .... I find it beyond belief."
i think that  Johnson & Johnson must me an interview
"I think survey should sent to the candidate who short listed for the position. Without short list, candidate can't answer the survey questions."
I think recruiters should meet candidates face to face to appreciate how much they are motivated to get the position.
"I think people like me should be given chance. I mean, my resume may seem to you that i do not fit with your offered job positions but if you could interview with me, it would certainly change your mind. Some people's qualifications may not satisfy you if you only look at their resumes. I am a teacher and i have always been my students' favorite teacher. Because i do not do my job, i live my job. My students keep telling me till date that when i teach it is as if i am living the topic i teach. I love what i do. I will love and do my best if you give me a chance. You will never regret. My advice is PLEASE TALK TO PEOPLE STOP LOOKING AT THEIR RESUMES ONLY. Best Regards "
I think more specific feedback when not going further in the selection process would be highly appreciated and helpful for subsequent applications.
I think more interest about not jr candidates
"I think maybe, just inform about the recruitment process so that a candidate can be aware of the situation."
I think Johnson&Johnson doing good job to improve the recruitment process
"I think Johnson & Johnson would have to make more personal the recruitment process. I feel the process was very ""automatic""."
"I think Johnson & Johnson should not send a talent acquisition survey before any contact about recruitment. I mean Johnson & Johnson did not make a phone call, or conduct a relevant survey about the job applied for. Sending such a survey without informing /contacting the applicants about the recruitment stages only gives inconsequential results."
"I think Johnson & Johnson recruitment process should give more chances for the canditates to show what they really are as employee. Sometimes cv is not enought to show that, so I suggest make more personal interviews. 


"
I think Johnson & Johnson operates with different standard outside the US when it comes to the employment process. There is no oversight or accountability. This is the impression I was left with. I hope and pray that I am wrong. I hate to think that there is double standards: one domestic and one international. 
"I think Johnson & Johnson is doing the right in the recruiment process, I appreciate a lot this opportunity to complete this survey, thank you for your response to my recent request,  I hope my profile could be useful for you in the future.

Best regards,

Carlos Montilla."
"I think J&J should evolve as most of the high-tech companies. J&J platform continues to be the same while many of the IoT (internet of things) companies are running live (like the SAP new business solutions), so it's easier to understand about the position and the candidate in a friendlier manner. 

In my personal case it's difficult to explain my experience since most of the companies don't understand the capabilities of a ""sogo shosha"" (Japanese Trading House), where you can do everything you want (sales, procurement, financing, investing, et cetera...), at any level. Everything I learnt at my MBA program, I've applied it in here, globally. 

So, as some examples, when a position asks if you have had an international experience my answer will be yes since I traveled 70% of my time globally, during 5 years, but I was established in Mexico. On the traditional format of HR of the traditional companies, it's impossible to explain it. Additionally, I attended the C-suite people of my company and potential partners but I am a hands-on person so people can consider me a leader, I am married to an Italian woman so I will get my EU citizenship late this year so it will be easier for me to work in different countries without bureaucratic paperwork, everything I do is always related to chemistry even though it looks contrary (i.e. renewable energy focused to make cleaner chemical processes). 

To finish, it's impossible to look for exceptional people through a traditional format. I can bet companies, and people, are missing opportunities due to this misconcept of measuring all the people equally. For some positions it might work, but not for others. "
I think J&J should at least contact people who applied to explain the reason why they are not selected. 
"I think J&J is a great company. However, the reputation that you have externally with respect to recruitment is that you only hire from within. I've heard this from head hunters, people in HR and other job seekers.

I interviewed for a role August 2016. For that role the HR person told me that I did well on the interview but the role went to the internal candidate. Any role I've applied to subsequent to that, I've not been approached by your TA.  So it is unlikely that I would apply for another role at J&J."
"I think it's quite good... 
"
"I think it's ok
thanks
best regards
Lorenzo Rampello"
I think it is right
i think it is ok :)
I think it is important to provide feedback on why the recruiter thinks the candidate is not a Good fit. Not discuss but to support the dicision. 
I think it is important to contact an applicant with any feedback once he or she has applied for a position. Otherwise it feels like applications posted online are never considered 
"I think if some candidate fulfill company,s criteria or qualified for the post he/ she has applied then atleast one chance should be given to him. I mean he/ she must be hired for 2-3 months probation period then company can better analyse his/ her capabilities because CV does not tell everything like candidate's personality, his enthusiasm for job , his communication etc.If candidate is qualified enough but do not have any experience unfortunate, opportunity should be given instead of rejecting him/ her. It will definitely reduce the moral of any person.Good and successful companies do not only create positive employment but also set good values in society. "
I thınk ı'm fit for this job ı am happy to work with you.
I think I should have heard something before I got this survey (besides the automated rejection email). Besides that it went as normal.
I think by contacting the job applicant by mail / telephone.
"I think avoiding standard e-mail responses would be appreciated  by candidates. The lack of mention to a reason  why a candidate is rejected only  creates disappoinrment and duobts on the Google grounds for rejection; is this gender, age, origin... All East to solve with a simple and real reason, candidate could learn on which specific profile you look for to Adviser others, and you could have a good brand ambassador for the future."
"I think a more detailed feedback about the reason behind not going to the next step would be beneficial & fair for each candidate to improve himself/herself and be a potential employee in next job post, I appreciate this survey though "
I think a follow up phone call to discuss would have been appropriate. Some peoples CVs might not look the best but they could be ideal candidates for your company.
"I thik the current process is fine. 

Thanks"
"I suppose you are in the same situation as many large companies : the applications are sorted out by automated systems (keywords, location...) and there is no time or resource to review the profiles and actually read in detail the resume/cover letters...Therefore, I have personally stopped applying with large MNC's who use the likes of Taleo, and other similar tools."
"I suggest, the company's hiring team/department should contact the prospective applicants of different country or race if he or she has a chance to get hired by the company. "
I suggest to send a weekly list of vacancies to all candidates registered in your system.
"I suggest to give a detailed feedback and a possible suggestion how to  improve communication and talent skills in cv and other related documents.
When a candidate applies for a position, this takes from 10 to 30 mins, he/she believes that the recruiter has a standard to follow to have a first check of the candidate's skills. A standard reply is not enough for a professionists who spends half an hour of his time. 
So It could be better to give a detailed feedback of the reason why he's not the best choyce for that role.
"
I suggest to do more questionnaires....
I suggest the recruitment requirement should have weight on each requirement so prospective candidates can weigh their options before applying.
I suggest that you select better employees for HR.
"I suggest that you can meet with candidates by using skype or Webex in order to manage the process better.
Thanks.

Kind Regards,
Hülya Karslı"
"I suggest not to send the standard answer mails to the candidate has failed. Write him/her only one reason why he/she was not the right one - behause ""there was an better matching candidate"" writes the whole world and thats not a good personal statement. 
Hope this helps you."
"I suggest not to post roles online when you have internal candidates to fill it.
I am a perfect match for all the criteria mentioned in your ad and I have not been contacted for an interview or a preselection. And this is not my first time to apply for a job in J&J and face the same situation. If your recruitment process is though 'recommendations only' please refrain from wasting people's time."
"I strongly looking to join J & J family, i do applying for suitable positions... but i am not received call from talent team"
I still haven't heard back regarding my application or its outcome. Unsure whether the application is still in progress or not. 
I started now my recruitment process so I don´t have information for improve it.
"I somehow think experience does not count for much in your selection process, especially for someone who has extensive experience, such as myself. I am also of the feeling that age is a factor in your selection process. My opinion is a person's medical health and fitness together with qualifications and experience must be the critical factors used in considering an applicant. Sometimes its easy to miss a gem amongst the pebbles.  "
"I sent my application more than 3 months ago and I have not, to date, received any response besides a confirmation of my application. This has never happened to me at other companies and leaves a bad impression of J&J."
"I sent my application in with a cover letter clearly stating I was not applying for the role advertised, that of HR Advisors/Generalists/Manager. I was sending my details in speculatively because my skills are as a shared service lead and I was wondering if there were any opportunities here

I did get a automated response but clearly there was no recognition of what I was doing clearly indicating that some form of automated tracking system had been used. This is just disappointing.

I recognise that you do this to save time, which is money, but the effect it then has on potential candidates is poor

This is just my opinion, but I hope it is of use "
I schould be informed whi I wasn´t selected for this postion

"I recommend that the mother company to be involve on the recruitment process in the gulf area ( dubai and kuwait) specially kuwait . because the people who works in these countries lack of diversity and only focus on certain nationality and they involve the religion in between.

I'm a British pharmacist with MBA. and I have 15 years experience in the pharmaceutical and medicall maret on kuwait and the gulf region in addition to my experience in UK. and when I have applied ...my application has been ignored not even giving the opportunity for an interview !!! where at the same time other companies such as abbvie and nestle had been impressed and I went through a fairly recruitment process with then. 

another point I must highlight is when u leave the recruitment process start with the manager who is working on this region , he always select workers with less qualification and experience than him to not threat his position! !! 

overall. my experience with J and J in UK was a good example of equal opportunity and diversity where I  Kuwait as the opposite !!!

I recommend Johnson & Johnson Dubai office to conduct face to face interview with prospective candidates with Healthcare business experience  
I recomand to publish on more web sites the jobs available.
"I recently applied for a Finance position, on the same pay grade as I currently am, in the pharm sector. This the same sector I have worked in for the past 3.5 years, as well as 3 years in an SSC prior to this. In total I have been with J&J for 6.5 years. 

I have worked to a very high standard, which has been acknowledged by my management and reflected in my annual ratings. Further I have been the receipient of 4 encore awards in 3 years, further testament to the standard I am viewed by my business partners and management. 

I felt I had a strong track record in delivery and could offer a lot to the position which I applied. I also took the time to meet with the hiring manager to discuss the role further. After applying for the position I had heard nothing for 3 weeks so reached out to our local talent acquisition partner. She informed me that they were at final interview position and I would only be contacted if they were unsuccessful in filling the position with final interviewees. 

In summary an internal candidate with a strong track record of delivery and 6.5 years expereince in Finance was not even afforded the opportunity to interview for this open position. 

I received a whitewash answer from the talent acquisition partner which left my feeling very angry and disillusioned. In fact my whole experience with talent acquision during my application for this role gave me the impression that they are incompetent. 

All of the above has clouded my view of the recruitment process and displays a clear lack of transparency with regards to feedback. I had to reach out to recruitment for an update on my application. As an internal candidate of 6.5 years standing I find that unacceptable and unprofessional. "
"I received this survey 5 times, this is the first link that works. I applied for an exciting role but did not get to speak to a recruiter, as I was turned down before even getting to that stage. I found it excessive therefore to perpetually ask me for feedback on a process I have very little awareness off. "
I received the same email twice (with arguments why I don't fit the job's requirements. I think it's enough one email for the feedback. Thanks a lot! Oana
I received the rejection mail in a few minutes after the application. So this this situation gave rise to thought that it was not a real job announcement or that there was no equal recruitment evaluation
I received notification that I didn't get the job through a generic email Months after applying. I would like to say that due consideration should be taken that it takes close to an hour to apply for a job with cover letter and other info. Most of which I would consider GIGO. I'd love to know how many people are actually recruited through this system versus Recruitment consultants and agencies + ee referrals. IMO Many professionals wouldn't be bothered taking the time to apply through this long overbearing process. Most think it takes just a C.V. with a recruitment consultant with a much higher probability of an interview due to a good sell so why bother filling this out. You might have already changed this process I'm not sure but IMO this application GIGO costs the company money through paying RC and Agencies huge money for a C.V. and a phone call not to mention the time wasted reviewing this GIGO. Either make the application process 1) faster and more seamless similar to that of Kerry Group by using a Taleo C.V. only system where you upload a C.V. or 2) actually consider that people have wasted alot of time applying for your jobs showing alot of interest to go through the GIGO process and at least give them a call to give 1) them advice on future applications or at least a personal non generic email to reflect the time they wasted applying in the first place. 2) Coach/Suggest to your candidates that are interested in a long term future with your company what they should do differently or appropriate jobs for them. Especially high quality applicants that may not be suited to a certain position but may be suited to other positions which they applied for either existing or coming in the future to watch out for. Take your recruitment seriously it will save you a fortune and reduce staff turnover due to more interested local people taking jobs rather than RC's selling a candidate. Look more time spent in the feedback process!   
I received no email telling me whether I had been successful or unsuccessful in gaining the PT1 position. I heard from a colleague that the positions had been filled by other candidates.  
"I received no correspondence from the recruitment department informing whether I had, or had not, been successful in my application. "
I received no contact from you. 
I received an email to the the survey for the position i applied for which i didn't receive a reply either i am accepted or not

I received an email from J&J Talent Acquisition which informed me that I was not longer in the process but they did not give me any reasons. I know it is not easy but it helps sometimes to candidates in their job searchings.
I received an automatic message but nothing more which I felt was impersonal. I believe that my experience and drive to achieve targets but at the same time looking into people's needs and objectives is a balanced quality that J&J strive for and share. I'm looking forward to an opportunity to prove this on another occasion should a suitable position become available within your organisation.
I received an automated email asking me to feedback on the process before I'd been told (again by automated email) that I had not been selected for interview.  
I received an auto reject within 24hrs of applying. As a recruiter that's implemented ATS in various organizations I'm all too aware that my application wasn't even reviewed. Therefore as an application it's difficult to highly score your recruitment process... ! 
I really wanted to work with Johnson & Johnson. I think it's really a big problem that the questions asked are not related to the working position. I'm sorry I can not work with you.
I really can't say anything.
"I really Appreciate if you had sent me the reasons for me not having an interview ... that would be a very good help  

Thanks .."
"I placed several appointments last half year and at any appointment I didn't fit enough -""a better fitting candidate...""- that can not be - "" and that additional with the background that I already have worked there..."" and so it is clear that this practice is not one which animates me to appoint again or to prospective such structures to everybody else around me. The process of contact and first personal contact by the HR departement to an possible candidate is to big several weeks til month is not a good timing in such a process.
So maybe you can improofe this in future in your concern.
Thank you very much for the possibilities in the past.
Kind regards

"I placed my candidature for this position because the Managing Director asked me to do this. Also the General Manager of J&J Germany referred me to this position.
But I was told that I will never talk to the Managing Director, becuase he wouldn't able to decide about the position, although he wanted me for, because of the fact, that the direct leader of the position was never asked..."
I personally think there is no need to improve the Johnson and Johnson recruitment process 
I personally need more transparency and feed-back on the recruitment process
I passed the initial tests and was told I would be sent a link via email to complete an interview. I didn't receive an email with a link to an interview and then got a rejection email about a week later saying I had been unsuccessful. Providing an email explaining the rejection would be a helpful improvement.
"I only received e-mail send by Johnson & Johnson Talent Acquisition Team internet mail robot. Im surprise that I cant reply to this e-mail address. 
In this E-mail is written that I was not be pursuing.  I send my applications for several positions.  Im confused, because of this e-mail didnt write name of the position. So I dont know for which position I was not be pursuing."
"I only received contact from Johnson & Johnson when I submitted my application nearly two months ago for the Engineering and Scientist Graduate Programme 2017, and have not heard anything since. You could inform applicants whether they have or have not made it through to the next stage of the recuitment process"
"I only received a rejection letter so do not have a lot to add here.
"
"I only had a phone interview, and although the interviewer gave me feeling that I will go to the next level interview, after 2 weeks I received an e-mail saying I am not further considered for the position I have applied for. This felt me believing that the position was already given when the recruitment process started. it seemed like a fake process, needed to document that J&J had a number of interview to fill this position, but in the end, a person (probably from the organization) known from the start got the job."
"I only got an email to inform that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Supply Planner met doorgroeipotentieel 
I have never had any phone call or interview for this position."
I now recruit people to work for you... I am a head hunter working pharma and medical devices for the belgium market. So thank you very much for not responding positively.
I never received any feedback or an invite for an interview. I know that you would not reply to everyone but this is literally the 10th survey review email request I have been sent and I have already filled out one.. 
I never received any feedback on the performance of my video interview .  An email to inform the candidate about the outcome is essential.
"I never received an email telling me that I did not get the position, I just received the email to do the follow up survey. I regularly check all my spam folders and there is no emails there.Therefore, it is not a good way to find out you've been rejected. "
"I never received a phone call or anything else. I just received a short e-mail that my candidacy wasn't goign to be pursued. Because it was an automated e-mail, i I wasn't able to get any feedback."
I never heard back from J&J nor the talent acquisition team or recruiter. If someone had the courtesy to respond it would be great. But this was not the case. 
"I never heard back as to whether I was successful or not in my application, this email is the first I have heard back from Johnson & Johnson since completing my video interview.

Is there anyway I can receive any feedback on this?"
"I never has been contacted in every position you can posted and I applied so in relationship with my seniority and my professional background it seems to me strange maybe I think that for an important company such as  jnj it could be mandatory to give a feedback to yours ""supporter"" only for the brand imagine too.
My Best regards"
I never got any feedback from you ...
"I never got an answer for my results at the online tests. So, I would like to suggest more frequent update for the application status."
"I never got a feedback! This is not how I expect to be treated upon sending a job application!
Not very impressed! There is a lot of room for improvement!"
I never even heard back about the position. I feel like the least the recruitment teams can do is give a response why you are or are not a fit. You should also be able to check the status of your application because it is disheartening to not hear back and be hoping that I am still being considered for the position.
I need a job in Johnson & Johnson 
I missed any kind of contact from the recruitment 
I love JnJ but applying for a job is cumbersome. It takes to much time and you don't get quickly feedback 
"I live 2 miles away from J&J and have applied to a lot of positions in the past, but unfortunately i have never been invited to come for an interview...ever. My credentials and job experience are not ""Horrible"" and that is the reason why i always stop and try! I'm just curious to see who are these ""Exceptional candidates"" that always by-pass my chance. Want to be like them. I hear that you have to ""Know"" people to get into J&J, but unfortunately i'm just an ordinary American citizen working hard and looking to provide my family well. I do not know anyone at J&J. So i guess i will never stand a chance! But ""Thank You"" for this opportunity to let you how i felt after all these futile attempts to at least hear about an opportunity to interview. "
I like to be informed about the outcomes of the application  
"I know that you are honest, you work well and that the people working for you who are satisfied.
I would like to work for your DePuy factory in Blackpool, I learned that you work really well.

"I know Johnson & Johnson as our customer and used to handle the account during my previous job. I have been very interested in joining  Johnson & Johnson team, However, I presume the applications are selected through system and probably some nationalities such as Iranian doesn't get any opportunity for their application to be processed or pursued. I have faced this challenge during my job search with some other companies too but still continue striving for an opportunity which will be a good match to my experience and skills. "
"I know it's impossible to have an interview with all candidates, but for the internal ones, whith more than 33 years experience and with a Directior position, in J&J, I expect more respect. Of the five positions that I applied, four of them, I just received the e-mail informing that HR decided not to proceed with my application. "
"I know it take's time but it will be very helpful for the candidate who is looking for the job in such a reputed organization by providing details in what way he/she can improve the ability to be prospective employee in the organization or at least in future.

Thank you  "
"I know it is a hard job you are doing. Getting tons of applications and going trough all of them is hard work. 

But every once in a while an applicant who doesn't meet a CV criteria can meet your expectations from the job, or exceed the expectations even better. I don't know an answer to this problem but what I might point out is consideration of company culture.

Even if a person has a quality CV tells little about if that person is a good match for your company culture. Maybe you would like to add a section to understand  the candidate's contribution to the company culture. 

I believe J&J is a great company who deserves great people. I hope someday I can have a chance to work with you. Until that time, goodbye. :)"
"i know is anonymous, but i want my voice to be heard. my name is Luca Steinle.
i have never managed to have an interview in J&J and dont understand how i could be asked to fill this review of your hiring process. even when i was referred for a position i was more than suitable i never was even called for an introductory call. i have issues even filling the submission form and i was told by my colleague in J&J that there were some issues when i applied as it was blocked for some reason.
i m aware this is not your normal recruitment process as i was looking forward to join your company as i heard only good things.
thank you
Luca

"I just received two different surveys in last 3 days.
It is a fast process for the beginning but unfortunately I do not have more idea about the recruitment process.
Thank you."
"I just have received negative / not follow on my application for J&J position. I didn t go to any process of recruitment , in this case I cannot give feedback.
I have only received e mail from J&J saying that my application will not be considered. I will be good to get more insights on the why, but I assume that due to the high quantity of applications, this step is not possible.
Best regards,
Rebecca LECHE"
I just got the system generated feedback that somebody else is more suitable than me. But i recommend Employer must provide specific reason for not to be selected. So that candidate must improve for future. 
"I just got a Mail, telling me that I do not meet the minimum requirements for this position. I took a second and third look at the requirements but could not find any qualifications that I do not meet. Therefore, it would be nice to get a second feedback about the reason for not being a good fit. Thank you in advance! "
"I just filled in the questionnaire about the recruitment process. There is not much idea.  I prefer to face-to-face

Best regards"
I just don't understand the way people or HR see professionals with a CV like mine in the market.  
"I hope that you offer a training for the new employees an don't ask for specific qualifications, I have started my job without any experience in Marketing, after 1 week training, I became compete the old sales and marketing person who has 10 years experiece.
I don't guess you will take my notice into consideration, but I have applied on the IT position because I have studied it in the University and I see myself in this field better and more creative than Sales & Marketing.."
I havent got any feedback which is sad as i would love to join the company 
I haven't received anything only this survey  about the grduate position I applied for.
I haven't received any feedback from Johnson & Johnson. It's a bit weird and inappropriate behaviour for such big and people focused company.
"I haven't received any feedback from J&J but as as far as I can read this survey, it seems that my application has not been retained. 

In that case, a good improvement would be to provide a feedback to the applicants.

Best regards"
I haven't received an answer If I'm still qualifying or not
"I haven't heard back anything from J&J will wish get some info about my application..?  

Better contact even automated

Job application tracking ability for applicants."
I haven't got any rejection or progression of the recruitment process since October last year. J&J should improve the speed of informing the candidates about in or out of the recruitment process.
"I haven't been called for interview, nor were contacted for reason of rejection. I don't have any idea about the full recruitment process to fairly judge it.

PS: answers of q3 and q5 are based on my market knowledge and external, not internal, feedback heard from the market. However, still J&J is a decent and reputed company despite of not being called for interviews nor contacted for feedbacks and despite of my continues full matching or close matching profile to jobs applied for! I trust that you have a good reason for this! Wishing you all the best."
"I have wait more than 3/4 weeks between the day I applied to the position and my HR interview (after I sent email reminder): after 1 hour of interview, HR explained me that there was already 2 candidates at final stage : ... strange process: either they could have contacted me before to explain that my profile was not in line, either they could have give me a chance to have my interview at the right moment in the process!"
"I have unfortunately still not been contacted despite completing the interview process 2 and a half months ago, any form of answer would have been appreciated. "
"I have two open applications and have never heard anything. 
Johnson & Johnson could improve to give a response to the applicant. The applicant spends time to do an application and it gives not a good picture of a company if you hear nothing for such a long time. Thanks"
"I have to say I was rather shocked at the recruiter´s behavior. Not that she was rude or anything but for a senior recruiter she seemed to lack experience. Also, I was among few people who made it to the last round and after I was rejected she wouldn´t even pick up the phone to let me know. Instead, I received an e-mail starting with the general phrase that all companies send to all unsuccessful candidates in the first round. I wrote back asking if she would be able to get me a concrete feedback. She never replied."
"I have the impression that vacancies are not really wanted, I was never contacted"
"I have the impression that vacancies are not really wanted, I was never contacted"
"I have the impression that vacancies are not really wanted, I was never contacted"
"I have the feeling that the applications drop in a big bucket and nothing happens with the applications. I do not get any reply. I really like to work for Johnson and Johnson, and I have applied for various positions, but no replies back. A bit disappointing. Best regards, Mark Rutten 0470 97 22 47"
I have still not heard back on the process of my application until I got an email to fill in the survey just now. 
"I have received this invitation to take the survey for the third time for three different job posting openings I applied for, no one contact me for my applications every time I apply although the criteria mentioned in the posting with highly matched with my qualification!
I changed my mind to apply in any future openings in J&J because I believe that all of this openings are not treated fairly or professionally.
last but not least, I cant add what you can do to improve the recruitment process because I didn't get involved in any."
"I have received an invite to rate my experience of the recruitment process before being informed if I am/am not suitable for the role. Timely feedback would enable me to better rate the experience. 

I have recently attempted to join the talent community but after entering my details and clicking submit it took me back to the original page- I have had no further contact so am unsure whether this was successful."
"I have received about 4 emails to answer this survey, I think that the minimal of J&J recruits should give a feedback explaining the reason of the dequalification, I dedicated my time to answer I expect the same from J&J instead an automatic email"
"I have received a feedback regarding the fact that my candidature will not take in account for the position but I have received no explanation regarding why mu candidature did not fit with the job opening. I know that is difficult to manage, but it would be great also to have information on why I'm not the right candidate in order to understand how to improve my skills."
I have positive experiance with screening over the telephone. This puts the cv in another daylight than what you see at first sight. I am very positive how my recent application was handled. I am looking forward to what the near futur can bring.
I have nothing to offer to improve the recruitment process.  
"I have nothing information from you. Any information. It isn`t okay
"
"I have not yet received any feed back following the second interview.  After 2 months I wrote to J&J asking for an update about the status of the recruitment, but never received a response.  Prior to this the person coordinating the interviews was very responsive.  I assume there was staff change and this was overlooked. "
I have not received any further updates on the recruitment pprocess.
"I have not received any communication regarding the position I applied to (except automatic reply). I would like JJ responsible persons to stay in touch with the candidates, inform they about the recruitment process, etc. "
"I have not even been invited to an interview.
I have received two e-mails: one with the information that I have been rejected after the interview, BUT I have not even been invited to one and the oter one with this survey.
Strange. Very strange.

Thank you!
"
"I have not been thru the entire recruitment process because I was rejected from the very beginning. I was told that I do not fit with the company culture. I see this as being totally inappropriate because in the first place I am not even a member of the so called Johnson@Johnson culture, though my name is Johnson. I think a recruitment process should aime at finding good candidates for the respective job, firstly and then later to see if that person is a good community member etc. I think that the recruitment process does not focus on finding key skills to the candidate. In the end I think that all is arranged and the job is already taken. I do not wish to be part of such ""culture"". "
"I have not been contacted by a recruiter, only with a web link I have been provide with the information that the position will not be filled due to internal restructuring. "
I have not been contacted at all
I have not been called for the interview as of yet !!!
I have not attended any part of recruitment process yet.
"I have no recruitment process attended in life. I've  just applied for position and no additional communication, even if I had contacted HR recruitment stuff via Linked in. I think that the stronger communication would be some point that can make your PR and ""trust"" increased. Good luck :) "
I have no oppinion on this particular
I have no news from the process.
I have no idea why I received this. I had no other messages from HR except for that
"I have no idea about J&J's recruitment process, because nobody has called me."
"I have no complains on Your recruitment process. I still would like to become part of your team at any position.

Sinecerely yours,

Ivan Cmrk

"
I have never received a kind of a message relating to my application ...
"I have never gone through a recruitment process with J&J therefore I do not understand why this email has been sent to me twice. 

I have sent my CV to J&J although I have never been contacted to participate in a recruitment process. 

Feedback given does not therefor apply in my case. "
"I have never ever been in a recruitment process ( I wish I could.)at Johnson & Johnson. That happened tome second time. İf ı have intrv. at Johnson & Johnson ı let you know about the process and share my experience with you.

Frankly,,, it is going to be my pleasure. 

Sincerely yours."
I have never been contacted for the process
"I have never been called back to you because I have never returned to your company in any way. I do not understand why you sent me such a test. But as far as I can tell, an uncontrolled e-mail came to me while I was trying to give an image of a human resource. Or I have applied from your international site.
Your information."
"I have master's degree MBM Master in business and management from United Kingdom and management bachelors degree BBA Hons in Finance, I applied for many position but still I am not suitable fit, do you people need PHD for hiring or what? I am not satisfied and not I will suggest my friends."
I have made almost 10 applications in past one year for different roles which were relevant to my experience. But not once I have been shortlisted or atleast spoken to any hiring team member. Does this mean I was not qualified for all the roles for even an interview which is a bit difficult to believe. I am now losing hope in this hiring process through compay website as I don't get any feedback why I was not selected
"I have had three ronds of interviews, and only a month after the last interview I just got a mail from global that they did not want to persue with me, without any explanation. I never got any feedback. Finally I found out that the reason was that I was not an MD, that was of course known from the beginning. I have never have a procedure like this before, no respect at all for the job applicant....."
"I have had no real contact with the recruiter as part of this recruitment process. I had an invitation to complete online assessments from a 3rd party, which I completed, but I received no response from Johnson & Johnson at all regarding the recruitment process. "
"I have had bad experience with Depuy Synthes in Zuchwil, Switzerland and I'm sure that they have make me in black list becau I cannot apply anymore.
Two guys have left and one is still at depuy Synthes,need to be fired from the company his name is Jean-Marc chollet."
"I have had absolutely not contact from this recruiter.  Even a simple note (or instant message as I am an internal J&J employee) stating that I was not chosen as a candidiate would have been appreciated.  As it stands, this is the first that I am hearing that I am NOT a candidtate."
"I have found that some recruiters respond to emails and others do not.  One recruiter I emailed four times and the hiring executive I emailed four times.  It is each person's responsibility to manage our own careers.  However, it is helpful to have some support as least to be able to inquire about a position, find out who the hiring manager is, or the status of the recruitment process. "
"I have experienced many recruitment process, which provides a clear and transparent process and retainment of the application if any other jobs open as matching to applicant profile, especially for experienced class. I would say this was not expected from a reputed company like j&j. "
I have completed this survey in relation to the role of Business Controller but I have never been contacted further to inform me if I was being selected for an interview.
"I have been through an interview with HR, did the o line test as requested, heard a feedback that was trying to contact he hiring manager and am waiting till today some return. Maybe the hiring manager left the company? "
"I have been promised to get my travel expenses covered by the hiring manager, until today I never received my money back. this should be clearly the responsibility of HR. Also, for one of the interviews I never received feedback and it seems HR did not followed up on this"
"I have been in some period by 3 years is looking for new opportunities in another site and another countries.

in this period only I have been 1 entreview face to face by skype for 1 position.

in the next opportunities, only after 3 o 4 months sent me a mail to told me that the position was cover for another person. 
"
"I have been contacted to provide ""missing"" documents (it was not possible to transmit them via the appication website)
since then, 1 month ago, i have never heard of Johnson & Johnson in Switzerland (Zuchwil) again.

I am very disappointed by this performance from a company like yours."
"I have been a former employee of JnJ - I was expecting at least an update to my candidacy to the position. In the past few months, I habe applied to couple of positions with no further actions towards an interview process"
"I have approached J & J directly twice via direct applications in last 5 years and never been called in. Meanwhile during my recent direct application I did come into interview for another opportunity for role of Operations Coordinator & Analyst through an agency as a contractor. The office building and location is very pleasant. However I am disappointed in J & J as they just do not seem to be organised at all. How can an applicant make a direct application and yet get called in via an agency for another role. The interview process was poor as the interviewer had only 40 mins slot and part of it was a presentation. Having put in significant effort for presentation I felt it was a waste of time because the expectation was not sensible. I was asked last minute for access experience which was not even listed on my CV. Bottom line I think J & J need to be clear about their analytical needs, have sensible budgets as £220 day rate is terrible. Make the interview process longer and only ask for a presentation if it useful to you otherwise it really is a waste of time and effort. Candidates have to put a lot of effort in to set up a presentation. I do not think J & J as approaching again for me our any member of my family and friends. Hugely disappointed in the process of J & J "
"I have applied to so many supply chain / logistics / SAP IT related positions in JnJ within the last 1 year, but most of the applications were rejected by sending an automated rejection email by the HR system, this procedure need to be abandoned as it reduces the chances of selecting potentially skilled and experienced future employees. I strongly believe JnJ is an equal opportunity employer without considering a person's race, religion, ethnicity or age group. Also need to give more preference to online applications rather than entertaining job agents by HR partners in the selection process. The hiring line managers must go thru all the potential applications to see the candidates experience and functional knowledge rather than the HR person makes an initial selection process. I have an MBA (from SUNY Buffalo), an Engineering degree, SAP and supply chain certification trainings, completed lean six sigma and project management trainings, but my applications are getting rejected by JnJ HR system, this is really disappointing especially from a global MNC like JnJ! Why not give me a chance to have a face to face interview with the hiring line manager and find out my capability? Hope the HR Senior Management will look into it and correct the practices. Thank you"

I have applied to many positions with johnson and johnson and do not hear back most of the time.  It would be nice to hear back sooner.

"I have applied many times for Johnson&Johnson position and although I have all the requirements for the position, I can never get through to a face to face interview.

"I have applied many times for J&J for Dubai location but always I m getting auto messages that my profile is not fit for the position. I have more than 11 years experience in Regulatory affairs for US, EU, AU, ..markets and worked for MNC companies. Even though my profile suitable for intended Jobs, I am always getting auto mail as not fit for position. Further J&J recruiter never contacted me. My small suggestion is before sending auto mail as fit or unfit,  J&J team should assess the candidate profile thoroughly by referring applicant CV and verbal communication.  "
"I have applied for so many jobs, very discouraging, but I love the J&J products and services for the communities around the world.
I wish I can get an interview with the recruiter.  It is hard to get a job at J&J without a referral from another employee?  I don't know, but I am not giving up, I will keep on applying every time there is a job that I qualify.  
Thank you for your follow up.


  "
I have applied for several positions but have never received any feedback. I suggest you review your hiring policies.
"I have applied for several positions at J&J over the past 2 years. The process is anonymous, automated, and inputting all the info is not very user friendly. No contacts at J&J are identified for follow-up or feedback. Rejection messages are automated, sometimes take very long, sometimes never come. It all feels like trying to communicate into a 'black box'.

It seems to me J&J is not making any efforts to reach out and connect to the diversity of talent in the market, but rather assuming that all talent will come to them, and they get to pick....as an applicant, you do not feel like you are treated with a lot of respect.

"I have applied for several functions in the past which were very closely related to my experiences and background within the Pharmaceutical industry. I have only been invited for an interview which I believe is sad, I the recruiters would take the time and effort to read the resumes in further detail I would maybe have been employed already.  I mentioned this also during the interview I had..."
"I have applied for many suitable profiles. But never heard back.
It's not a problem if a person is not selected. But it's always great to know the status of the application. For the only reason that the applicant knows that the online applications are at least considered.

"I have Applied for different jobs. Seems to me I have to start everytime from the beginning because there is no Connection between the recruiters. Each recruiter didn't know about the  interviews I already had to lead.
Further, I didn't get Any information about the progress of the recruitment process. What a pitty! "
I have accidentally uploaded a wrong file into the system and wanted to change it directly after the upload. As the system does not provide any editing I contacted the customer service. Even after 3 emails I did not receive any reply. Only after 4 weeks I got a system generated email that the application process was not successful. This is really not at all the way you should handle talent issues. I will not anymore consider J&J as potential employer as the customer service for your application process was so miserable. 
"I HAVE 25 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN HR AND DESPITE MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS, I WAS NEVER EVEN CALLED FOR A PHONE INTERVIEW. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS DECISION IS BASED ON MY AGE AND HENCE MY PERCEPTION ON THE COMPANY.

"I had zero feedback. 
I understand the number of applications makes virtually impossible to update each and every candidate but some sort of feedback would be highly appreciated. At this point as I'm compiling this survey I have no idea if the position is closed or I can still be considered for it. It should be closed right now. "
"I had the impression that the questions for the online interview were all very similar. Also the deadline of fulfilling the interview in the next 48 hours can possibly be enlarged, as sometimes you don't have immediately acces to ""quick"" internet for a day or two. Although, most of the time it is probably a good idea to set this deadline.
The e-mail on whether you're invited to the ""in-house day"" came only a couple of days before the day itself and almost more than a month after the online interview.
It would also be nice to provide feedback on online interview."
"I had several recruitment process in J&J, but the last one I partecipate I was contacted by the recruiter by phone but he/she was not present neither during the interview or during the final feedback."
"I had not feedback at all, I just had phone call with recruiter, than I know that position is frozen "
I had no interview at all.
I had no chance to meet  company by person that's why can not deliver better feedback. Email exchange was on common level.
"I had applied to open positions in India and other countries. Despite having sufficient experience and qualifications, I was being rejected. The only reason ever provided was the application was rejected, but a more specific reason was never given. To add to this, it was never mentioned in the description that j&j do not sponsor visas.

"I had an odd experience, because just before the second ""skype"" interview I was told, via email, that JnJ would no longer continue the recruitment process. Apparently they no longer had the head-count for the position, so I was surprised to receive the email at 10.02am, when the interview was scheduled for 10am. 

Other than that, I was really enjoying the process and getting to know the HR collaborators. 

Hopefully, next time, I will have better chances."
"I had all the requirements matching for the applied position.
Also my profile was referred by a J&J employee based in Prague office, still a valid reason was not provided for rejection.
I understand, there are many applications online and a common auto generated response is sent to declined candidates, but I would suggest to send the true reason for rejection atleast to the internally referred candidates so we can work upon the same and apply with more confidence next time."
"I had a video interview, I had no email on whether my interview was successful, no response to my follow up e-mail. This is an issue that needs fixing so applicants know where they stand."
"I had a great experience talking to a recruiter at the NSBE regional conference in Chicago, who told me that I was strongly qualified but that they didn't have any open entry-level positions at the time. I reached out to them several times to establish a contact within J&J, but they never responded. "
"I had a confirmation when jnj received my subscription.
A long time later i received a negativ answer.
Would be nice to have an info in between like ""in examination"" or sth like that just to know that something happens, that someone is reading the subscription."
"I had a 3-4 weeks wait between final presentation/interview and receiving feedback on the managers decision. I was told the decision would be provided within a week. As someone on contract, trying to plan for the future, it's important I get feedback on interviews asap so I can plan my next move accordingly. "
"I had 2 interviews by phone (one with local HR ; one with the hiring manager from abroad) while face-to face interviews are more valuable. 
While I understand the gain of time for a first screening to do it by phone, it remains important to have face-to-face interviews certainly with the employees based in the same country - it gives more insights to the candidate about the culture, the values,... of the company."
i guess I will not be interveiwed for the position 
"I got to the video interview stage, and despite sending a number of emails to ask of its outcome and kindly ask for feedback, noone ever got back to me. It would be good to at least let people know that they have been unsuccessful because afterall a lot of effort goes into each stage of the process and to get to the interview and not even be told you have not made it to the assessment centre seems a bit disrespectful."
"I got through the tests which I feel I did well in. 

Then there were issues with my video interview, it kept getting the date pushed back and when I did it, there was no word back. I didn't hear anything until over six months later to hear I didn't get it. Overall the experience was disappointing and I can't believe I could get past rounds which not many pass and actually hear nothing back. 

Would not recommend. "
"I got the Information, I'm over qualified.

"I got informed prior to Christmas that I had got through to the assessment centre to which I replied saying I had already committed to another interview on the same day, therefore would there be another assessment centre. To which I got a reply to the day before the assessment centre saying no, giving me no time to change the date of the other interview. If I would of been told in time after my numerous emails, I would of rearranged the other interview."
"I got an e-mail with a PW and user name to be used for the application process, and this seemed efficient, but the link I had to start the application process didn't work, so I don't know how the recrutiment process work."
"I got a standard eMail response that there shall be more suitable candidates for the position.
This is frustrating and unfortunately practice in a lot of companies nowadays, but it does not help candidates on the search for a new opportunity, especially like me over 55 years of age."
"I got a pre recorded video interview on 28th November, whereas the whole process of recruitment was done by 14th November. I know this because the last question during the video interview was, will I be available on 14th to give in person interview if I get selected. Yeah, I have the time travel machine with me. Apologises for being unprofessional and giving a sarcastic comment, but that was terrible on the recruitment team, as if playing a joke on a candidate for the recruitment process. For me, that was demotivating, seemed like, mocking an already nervous student who wants a job by giving them an opportunity which doesn't exist. I may not be the best candidate according to your HR team, which is why I never got a callback, but that wasnt professional on your side too. Please, update your system, because clearly the email sent to candidates doesn't line up with the whole recruiting process. Thank you."
"I got a mail to which I couldn't reply. For such a high level position (Senior Director) I would have expected a personal contact (mail by somebody or a short call).

However, I got 5 automatic reminders to do this survey.

Pity, for J&J as well.

Hope to get a closer contact next time.

"I get really disappointed in the recruitment process because the recruitment was for a training and I had all necessary qualifications and skills required, so it was very disappointing to receive an email just saying that Johnson & Johnson choose not to continue with my application with no reason why, and without an interview in person. If I had not the right profile to the training I would understand, but I had all requires skills and qualifications, so I would expect at least some questions about me and an interview in person. I was really excited with this recruitment but it just turned to be disappointing and I'm sad about that, because I had Johnson & Johnson like an excellent pharmaceutical company to work, but after all maybe you didn't pay attention to all candidates. I really hope next time you take some more time to know the people behind the cv's. Thank you"
I get nothing... why!
I genuinely believe that my experience and CV was a good fit for the role that I applied for and I'm not convinced that it was reviewed appropriately.  I feel that I received an automated response rather than a considered assessment of my experience.  
"I found too complicated the mails I received. 
"
I found the whole process very disjointed and difficult to apply for. I completed my online tests at my university and later received an email informing me that i would soon receive an invitation for a video interview. A few days later I received more emails asking to complete the online tests even though i had already done so. My final communication with the company was an email informing me that I had not been successful after the video interview stage even though i never initially received a link to be able to complete the stage. 
I find it difficult to answer. The all my expeience about the recruitment process was a partisipation in two talent acquisition anonymous survey. 
"I filed my application, but I never received any response. So an improvement is easily made by just respond to an application. "
I feel the process does not take into consideration the freshers (fresh graduates). 
"I feel that Johnson and Johnson needs to improve on recruitment process. I never got a feedback on my previous applications. I spent considerable amount of my time applying for these positions, I wish from Johnson and Johnson that this is recognized in a respectable way. "
I feel like every company is doing recruitment wrong so there is nothing really particular to J&J
I feel as this process is simpe and hassle free 
I expected faster feedback on CV which was already sent month ago.
I doubt you can call this a recruitment process... Maybe start by hiring a competent HR
"I don´t understand your recruitment process well,
I received 2 emails the same. Where they tell me to value the recruitment process. And I still can not respond because the process has not yet begun.

"I dont know why Im being sent this survey since I have never got any feedback on my application, no one has contacted me!!!"
"I dont know what to say, because i didn't receive any calls or email to contact me."
"I dont know
"
"I don't think you should be asking for feedback from a candidate who hasn't made it to the next stage and just received an automated email for the rejection.
 It would be more useful and relevant to get in touch with people who at least spoke to a recruiter...

I don't seem to have received an e-mail in response to my application 
I don't know. I didn't participate in interview.
I don't know.
"I don't know, i think its good enough."
I don't know your recruitment process to advice you what can do to improve it.
"I Don't know why you have sent this survey to me.
Several weeks after applying, i only got an email that they decided to give the position to another applicant.
Honestly, i do not believe this was a fair recruitment process. I have the feeling that a decision was made on beforehand.
I was never part of a normal process.
Very disappointed, i can tell you. I expected more from a so called professional multinational.
Rgds."
"I don't know why you have sent me the survey, since I hardly remembered that I applied for J and J because nobody at all has reached me over the phone or even via email.

Thanks"
I don't know because I haven't been recruited .
"I don't know ,
As I did not gone through the assessment process no one contacted me from your side for interview so I can't judge the process.
Regards."
I don't Know
I don't have much experience with J&J to comment on this.
I don't have enough information to respond to that question. This survey is the first feedback that I got since I applied for the Trainee Program.
I don't have any experience of that.
I don't have any advice in this instant...
"I don't even remember if I ever got a response (I think I didn't) but if I did it was long enough ago for me to forget about it. So I suggest if you send a survey, send it directly after your feedback on the application. "
"I don't believe I received an accurate reason as to why I didn't progress through to the next round. 

I was told that I lacked blue-chip FMCG experience, due to my current role working at a start-up / SME (which I had been in for 9 months). However prior to my time in this role, I had spent 8 years working at blue-chip FMCG companies. My CV was either not reviewed properly or there was another reason why I didn't progress through. Honest feedback is always best - so I know how to improve for future applications!"
I don' know
"I do receive two feedback e-mails when I apply for a position at J&J; An immediate confirmation e-mail that my application was received and at a later stage a conclusion e-mail. So clear communication loop that works just fine. 

The conclusion sentence in the second e-mail was as follows:
"" We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position ....... at Johnson & Johnson Medical NV "". Well to be honest, this is the feedback is like an automated answering machine.

Negatif answer is just a natural outcome that applicant understands, however surely still not a pleasent situation. I think some centences like here in below would really make the reply more nicer. 

- We really appreciate that you took the time to consider us.
- We are fortunate to have many qualified candidates apply to each of our positions. We have reviewed the qualifications of each candidate and after careful consideration, we have determined that the credentials of other candidates may better fit our needs at this time
- We have now had the opportunity to thoroughly check all candidates' documents but regret to inform you that we have received other applications that more closely fit our job profile.

Thank you so much, I appreciated so much for your feedback request, it is a nice representation of what J&J is about."
"I do prefer detailed online  questionnaire to screen candidates 
Based on the score gained through this questionnaire you can move ahead and read the CVs, make interviews..etc"

i do believe that can't provide truthful ideas to due to not reaching any stage of those process .
"I discovered after the final interview that it was a nominal unfair process as it was predefined person to win even before the recruitment started ,
EM post and location is Lebanon ? Why ?
It's usually Dubai or cairo or Istanbul but never Lebanon ,this was made to fit the PM who won it .
The person who was selected is a good profile product manager but can't be compared to an experienced CVTL with 7 years of marketing experience and a total of 13 years experience in bigger MNCs and high rating in all performance reviews including 3 in JNJ .
The recruiter said that I'm of a great experience and excellent profile but in my third year in JNJ I'm still new to the organization and need more time to understand the matrix organization like jnj :)
Anyhow , it's not something wrong for leaders to think that someone would fit a position more than others but it should go by direct selection rather than acting like we have a fair competition ."
I didn`t have any contact with recruter
"I didn't take any call for interview, although I believe that i'm a very suitable candidate for the position."
"I didn't receive any feedback after submitting my application if i am less qualified, over qualified or even do not matching the post.
Now i received your questionnaire to submit my feedback for nothing done from your side.
I do recommend to contact the candidates after filtering the application process and feed them back about their status (over/ less qualified, matching...)
Then you start to complete the recruitment process.
And after each rec. step a feedback should be sent to the candidate.

Thanks"
I didn't not receive any response after I applied. 
"I didn't meet any recruiter even if I was expecting to have at least one interview with him/her because of my professional experience. I didn't receive any feedback about lack of contact and I don't have any internal connection to employes/managers at Johnson &Johnson to know more or to be supported in order to meet a recruiter.  
I can imagine you received lots of applications but it would be really great to give opportunity for a talk about the position to Professionals like me.
I hope that my reply may be helpful for you.

I didn't have more contact form any recruiter more than the automatic response we received your application.
I didn't have any call or email from the recruiter. It seemed that the recruiting process didn't even start.
I didn't get any feedback.
I didn't get an response. You could improve that.
"I didn't get a rejection email. I only got the email with this survey so I suggest, start by rejecting the candidates first and explain the core reasons for the lengthy wait and eventual rejection in that email. 
I believe that will be very helpful in the future. Thank you for considering my application.

I didn't do the video interview as it was over the Christmas break and I was away and with family so didn't get chance. I would have really like to apply for the position but didn't get the opportunity 
I dident have any expirence to say something.
"I did study Mechatronics Engineering for all of those years because I was hopping to find a graduate job to try to improve my experience further in this field and to progress.
But unfortunately, maybe due  my age, I wasn't giving any opportunity to do so, therefore no comment>>>

"I did not receive feedback after the interviews, even I called several times I received the answer that the decision was not made. Then I received only an email saying that we will not the position with you..."
"I did not receive any written feedback or a phone call during 3 weeks after the interview with Customer Service Manager Agata Zygmunt. That interview took more that 2 hours and I believed that I am a strong candidate to the post. After 3 weeks I sent an e-mail to J&J recruiter Karolina Strzyminska asking her about feedback on the process and the interview. The answer I got was very general: ""we can not offer you a job"". I sent another e-mail asking her about more details and I got the answer: we chose other person who has broader experience in managing people. I feel it was just an evasion. My experience in managing people was indicated in the application and therefore I perceive this process as very unprofessional."
I did not receive any feedback from recruiter neither via J&J Talent acquisition nor via hh.ru and I am really disappointed that the-dream company-to-work-in has such an unclear recruitment process.
"I did not receive any feedback after the interview despite the fact that the hiring manager assured me to provide update. Moreover, I had to pay for teleconference significant amount of the money. If I only knew I would never apply for position. JJ have great credo but treats senior qualified people unfairly with no respect."
I did not receive any answer to my application and feedback.
I did not receive a feedback in the process of reviewing my CV.
I did not make any interview with your company. I applied for the vacant positions but nobody get in touch with me
I did not involve in the recruitment process
I did not hear back from johnson and johnson for a month after my interview. Very rude
I did not hear anything for several weeks after the interview. I had been told I would hear the following week. Not satisfactory after taking the time out at such a busy time to travel to Limerick. I have attended many interviews but this was very disappointing.
I did not have any recruiter at all....
"I did not have any contact to my application.
The process is highly negative!"
I did not get some responce at all! I do not even know if the position is occupade or not. I have only got an not to replayable confirmation email.
"i did not get passes CV screening point, some feedback on this would be useful, however I know that this is not possible. I feel that the rejection was quite generic, however it was useful to know that I was not successful."
I did not get chance for any interview 
I did not get any response for my application. However I appliyed twice. 
I did not contacted by any recruiter from Johnson & Johnson
"I did a video interview 3 months ago and did not hear back. I emailed Karen Smith, University Talen Recruiter as she is directly related to the role I applied for. I still did not hear back. I then contacted HR using details provided on your website. Again, I did not hear back. I am assuming this survey means I was unsuccessful? Pretty appalled with the communication from the recruitment team? "
"I couldn't attend the second interview because of the timing of the ""Sales Training Specialist"" role based in İstanbul . I'm still very sorry about that.

I would like to thank Yesim Turgay and İlknur Alacicek. They were the best interviewers I've ever seen."
"I contacted the recruiter five times and never heard back how I done, not to even let me know if I was successful or not. After the third email I finally got a reply that I would get a phone call which I never did. I was very disappointed as I would love the opportunity to work for Johnson and Johnson but dishearten about the whole process, so much so that I feel I would have a disadvantage in applying for future positions.

I completed the online tests and the day after I received a new email asking me to complete the same test again. I sent an email to the recruitment team asking if I should do it again and got no reply. Only a week after I received an automatic reply saying that I was not selected to continue the recruitment process. I do not know to what extent this situation influenced my process. 
"I case of not completing process, feed applicant back by the reasons."
"I case of not completing process, feed applicant back by the reasons."
I cant say right now.
"I cannot say much based on the experience during this particular job application process. After applying, I only received a (probably automated) email from the recruiter, stating that the team has chosen not to pursue my candidacy for the position. No feedback on particular areas of weakness was provided, or a reson for me not being a good fit. I think that more information on this topic would have been useful (particularly for my personal development). So, I would advise to offer at least some sort of feedback to applicants regarding the reason for not being selected. My opinion regarding JNJ is favorable overall (after all, I have been working here for eight years), but regarding the talent promotion and people development, as well as recruitment processes, I consider JNJ's approach to be below average."
i cannot recommend any further since Im sure they are certain on every requirements they have. 
"I CANNOT ANSWER, I SENT ONLY ONE CV."
I can't get any improvement in the recruitment process since the previous time of application
I can't answear this question because I haven't any knowledge about your recruitment process. 
I can suggest that in the recruitment process will be useful for the candidate to receive a customized feedback rather than a precompiled one. The candidate will have also a better opinion about the company
"I can not recommend J&J to my friends or family members, because I don't have any experience with J&J as employee"
I believe you should mention time day address when to conduct interview as I was waiting for your call since day I applied 
"I believe that, for a entry level opening, a chance should be given to a candidate deciding upon the level of education he/she has taken and not judge on the current work experience.

If I was given a chance to join J&J, I would have done well in Demand planning role, though my experience of 1 year after masters in Supply Chain and Global Logistics is in Logistics stream.

Some candidates need a support from the company to pursue their area of interest, in this case Demand Planner is my area of interest. 

I hope that soon I will be given an opportunity to work in Johnson & Johnson and grow along with the organization.

Thank you."
"I believe that you tend to miss out on hiring good talent by not giving an opportunity of an interview to a deserving candidate and it becomes a matter of chance.
I have had a bad break and i have a hunger for achieving success now in my field. I would have given it my all to succeed and grow within J&J."
"I believe that they could also carry out a more detailed study of each candidate; An online interview to corroborate what is expressed in each curriculum. In addition, the experience should not be an impediment, in the case of positions of lower hierarchy."
"I believe that there was lack of feedback.

The same day or the day after I applied for the job I received an auto reply saying you had chosen not go consider my application. That was it. (However I believe I have the relevant experience (have among other positions worked for several years at P&G with supply management))

Well, that is my feedback to you

I believe that the selection process is too long so I would shorten the deadlines for selecting the right person for the position.
I believe that the recruitment process is appropriate
"I believe that the recruiter can work on a better communication with the applicant. I applied for a function on a sunday evening and I received a message from HR on monday morning that they wil not send my resume to the department in question. I stay convinced that only a member of the Clinical Research department can decide wether or not I am suitable. I fulfilled 85% of the requirements, so I think it's strange that my resume and cover letter was blocked by HR. Maybe the research department would have decided to invite me for an interview, if they had received my application. I also think it is unfortunate that I received the mail for HR from a no-reply email, so I was not able the ask for the motivation behind their decision.

"I believe that giving feedback to applicants, already eria a good start. So, this is a multincional."
I believe that consistent feedbacks might help candidates identifying new potential opportunities. 
"I believe JnJ is only targeting candidates holding EU nationally or EU work permit to join the posted vacancies.
I think it would be great and more transparent to hinge a crystal clear message at your career Web site that you do not accept new employees form Middle East and Arabian countries! "

"I believe it is normal (and expected) to give feedback. Am high profile professional within the industry and expected at least a short email from the hiring staff. This questionnaire appeared to be the only source to know that ""I was not a good fit"" "
"I believe it is highly important for applicants to receive feedback from recruiters on their soft and hard skills, and on how to improve them. In that way, applicants can efficiently work on that to ultimately achieve the company needs."
"I believe (want to believe) this was an exception, due to I did not get any experience with the recruiter. No person contacted me at all."
"I appreciate this brief survey to check your recruitment process, anyway without any human contact I think it's very difficult to figure out the best profile."

"I applied your many ad but only you send negative messages.
You don't see fit to a phone interview ...
How I can think positive about your company?"
I applied via your website in June 2016 but never received any response on the progress. Until January 2017 when I received an e-mail that I do not proceed to the next round. This time line seems a bid odd to me. 
"I applied twice for the same position because I did not receive any response for 4 months and during the second application the website seemed to be newly set up and it was not transparent enough, that I would not have an option to upload my full CV as a pdf document. In my opinion the whole online recruitment process has a lot room for improvement."
"I applied twice by myself, also my former colleague who is a director in J&J recommended me for a position. I believe my skills and professional experience fit very well  the positions I applied for. But nobody contacted me at all, totally zero reaction for any applications and recommendations. I think it's not the best approach to recruitment and talent acquisition. I guess J&J would greatly improve their recruitment process if they don't ignore potential candidates, at least for manager positions."
"I applied to the Johnson and Johnson Commercial Marketing Graduate Programme and recieved email confirmation that my application had been recieved. However, I was never contacted again regarding my application. It would have been great to recieve an email saying that my application wasn't being followed up but I recieved no information regarding any aspects of my application."
"I applied Three times for suitable posts and I was contacted by a recruiter in two cases. Had a quick chat over the phone and I was not so much impressed by the recruirer skills. Furthermore She used tipical J&J internal jargon that of course I could not know. 
It was Clear She was not so much interested as She looked for someone from pharma industry Even if it's not extremely important for an IT management Role. 
My opinionion is that the selection process was only formal (typical in Italy) as the   candidate to be hired was decided already
This was not a surprise for me as I know how the Best US policies bacame completely useless in Italy"

"I applied for three positions with J&J. I didn't hear from you and I've just received automatic emails to tell me ""...we decided to pursue other applicants...""
I can't evaluate this experience because I didn't have any contacts with the HR or ""talent acquisition"" team.

I applied for this roletter months back and this automated survey mail is the only contact I've received. Extremely impersonal.  
I applied for the position and received an email which was not giving any specific reason. It is hard to say if my application was given actual consideration in the absence of a reasoning. 
"i applied for the position and only 6 months later i was told (by automatic mass email) it was cancelled because the business requirements have changed. Nobody contacted me personally.

"I applied for the METL role after completing 2 years of an Acting METL role of which I did not receive remuneration for year 1.

In the 2 years as Acting METL covering two shifts I performed all requirements of the METL role i.e Managed a team of 26 people, Reviews (Mid term & End of Year), Core,Payroll,Absenteeism,Complaints. Working with cross functional teams to drive the business needs.

I expected that the experience and contribution I gave over the last two years would have stood for something before entering the interview process.

During the interview, it was not acknowledged that I had been doing the METL role for the last two years, I felt there was more focus on educational requirements for the role ie Level 7 and above honours than experience.I find it hard to believe that the company puts more value on a person just out of college with a degree and little or no work experience than an employee with a proven track record, experience in the role and over 12 years served.

A question was posed during the interview where the interviewer questioned my interest in the role and I was told that the company was looking for a committed person who will give 120%. I believe I was that person going into the interview and had proved it over the years in every department I've worked in Vision Care and (sorry to repeat myself) had also been doing the role for the last two years but when I heard that I kindly agreed with him and I ended the interview.

NO reply at all. I asked her through LinkedIn.com if the position was still available. But again no reply at all. RESPECTLESS. Finally I applied again for the SAME position some weeks ago and I got a reply within a few days. Rejected but anyway a reply. As a form JnJ employee I would have earned better.

I just recieved an email weeks later in german, dont know why in that language, because we communicate in english, saying they can not give personal feedback.

"I applied for a Team Lead role and heard nothing back for nearly 2 months so did not actually get interviewed at all despite having the relevant qualifications and over 17 years of experience in a supervisory role so it was a bit perplexing not to even be called for an assessment or interview.

"I applied for a job and only received an automated reply.

"I applied end of November 2016 and received final feedback by the hiring manager end of March 2017. This is far too long, even if the hiring manager has a lot of work.

After the second panel interview end of January I asked several times for feedback until I got finally negative feedback after nearly two months! 

Within the recruitment process the recruitment manager changed because she resigned until end of December 2016. The new recruitment manager seems to be dropped in somehow... 

The hiring manager invited me to join the talent community but I never received a official invitation from the recruitment manager or recruitment department. 

I still think jnj is a really good employer but the whole recruitment process organized by the hiring manager (not by the recruiting managers) was a nightmare and not professional at all.

"I applied back in early October and did not hearing anything from them until the end of March, when I simply received a rejection letter. 

Very unprofessional and has become a joke amongst those in my course who all had the same experience."
I appear to have received a standard email response without anybody contacting me in any format! Very disappointing for a company of J&J's calibre.
"I am well aware of the fact it is complicated to provide detailed answers or explanations why an application was rejected due to the high volume of applicants. Yet the standard answer is desperately useless besides the fact it formally closes the application process. Since there must be max 5 reasons why a résumé does not lead to an interview, I think you could slightly improve the ""standard"" answer and make the effort by choosing one of those reasons when answering candidates. 
In this specific case, I am, naturally, under the impression my application was very quickly rejected although I think i had an interesting experience for the role (obviously, otherwise I would not have applied, right?)

Thus, I consider It's too early for me to bring some proposals to professionals of the company regarding recruitment process."
"I am very disappointed, I applied for all the possible positions for a graduate and got no answer but the ""regret to inform you"" bot message...

"I am very confused that having a high academic education and having developed different positions in the pharmaceutical & biotechnology industry, I do not fit into ANY position of low, medium or high qualification. In addition, the same generic email from J&JTalent Acquisition Team (not from a specific recruiter) is always received: ""......At this time, we  have  identified a group of candidates that more closely meets the needs of the business and will not be pursuing your candidacy for this position"".
I will continue sending my applications to J & J because I share their Core values and I thnk my training allows me to aspire to a job position in the pharmaceutical industry. Nevertherless, I would challenge J&J to make public the CV that presented the candidate who would occupy a specific job position with the requisites requested in the job offer (this would allow to evaluate the work of the recruiters). "
"I am sure JNJ has the opportunity to choose among very talented applicants, but I never get invited to an interview, even though I have 10+ years of Finance experience in a global corporation, I hold an MBA from The University of Chicago, so that I am also a very talented applicant for the positions I am applying. 
I believe the reason why I don't even get an opportunity to interview is that I come from a very different industry, and the talent acquisition person, who is typically a junior person, does not put enough weight in the interest I have for the job and passion that I would bring to it.  
If I had the opportunity to interview with a senior Finance person, e.g. CFO, I am sure I can convince that I can transition smoothly into healthcare which is my professional aspiration.
So my point is that the screening of candidates is also a very important stage and by delegating to a junion talent acquisition person, JNJ might be losing strong candidates.  "

"I am not very closed to J&J TA process, but to date at least I could advise: 
1. To inform each candidate of their current status (I was informed only about receiving my application and has no idea about current status - am I rejected or am I still in pull of candidates for consideration?)
2. To inform candidates about general steps of the TA process besides “we have received your CV etc.”, i.e. “thank you for your interest and applying, we have some checking list re formal requirements and after your overall fit to it we would be happy to invite you for assessment procedure or to solve business case or to invite for interview with TA” etc. 
3. To be more creative in automatic replying. This survey is 2nd for me but the text in your mail is the same. Firstly I even thought that it’s a mistake and I just have to answer the same previous questions.
 
But, it’s a very good idea to ask each applicants and have feedback re several issues about the Company and TA process.

Thank you,
Anna

I am not sure whether someone has even viewed my application since I don't have any feedback. It would be nice to have any alert about it :) The application status on Taleo page doesn't say too much....
I am not sure I ever got a response to my application (or it might have been long after the application) although I believe I had relevant experience. It would be great to receive feedback from recruiters to understand the gaps in my experience 
"I am not recalling exactly the number of positions that I have applied, it is less than 5 positions for sure, but no one ever call me for an interview. I remeber part of the positions I applied was in my area of experience but still got no call.

I am convinced that Johnson&Johnson is a very good company to work for. But the recruitment process is very bad. It takes so much time till someone contacts you and it is very impersonel because you have no contact person.
I am aware that the recruitment team can not give feedback on every candidate but I would really appreciate if the recruitment team mention the reason you are not continuing in the process: for not fulfilling enough of the requirements or for being overqualified. Thank you.

"I am applying for various position in J&J since 3 years, now i am 8 plus year experienced in FMCG sector, still i receive same response from the J&J recruitment cell that i used to receive 3 years before . I believe for right candidate there should not be any  boundary to be recruited, where ever applicant wish to apply and J&J should provide VISA sponsorship to the potential candidate . I strongly believe due to my past experience that in spite of stating "" equal  opportunity employer"" J&J still lacks the will to provide job opportunity to those applicant who don't have work permit to work in the country they applied for .

I am an experienced candidate who is expert in marketing and sales. But since 7.4 years even after doing MBA AND B. PHARMA from top notch INDIAN SCHOOL never been received shortlisting.

I am an ex employee of Johnson & Johnson in a European country and hence the reason for me to apply when I recently moved to the UK. I have not received any feedback nor reply to the emails I sent. 
"I am already a J&J employee but even so, I applied for a job in a different sector. Even with the additional information of knowing the comapny and processes, I still found the process extremely poor.

I received 1 email during the whole process and that was an automated mail telling me that my application was under review. I had no further contact, not even an automated email.

When I wanted to check progress, I found an old link and followed it to get a status on my application. When I managed to do this, I was told that I didn't get the job. There was no way to get any feedback and no further information on why I didnt get to the interview stage.

I would have expected better comunication, in fact I would have expected at least some communication. It would also be nice to have some feedback on why I didnt get so much as a conversation with the hiring manager or an interview.

I am a highly qualified candidate I think someone from recruiting should at least tell me why I did not qualified.
"I am  sure that J&J is exiting company and leader in the industry. Bur hiring process is outdated. Your HR test CV word file- it is not relevant because you can taste anything if read paper only. Of c course organisation of text, design etc could give some info but you know that all CV are the same because nowadays people use same forms. If HR starts process with checking word files he ( she) has uncontrolled right to dived people so I think some candidate are missed. Can you hire surgeon by CV in word ? I think no. But why do you hire sales person via writings? We aren""t journalists we are experienced managers  "
"I always wanted to work at Johnson & Johnson, I mentioned it passionately in my first letters. I wish I had received, at least, a reason for mot being chosen. not  just a padronized email: ""not yet!""."
"I always considered J&J a company of choice, and I am aware of the many applications you received on a daily basis.   By reading the position requirements, I strongly believe I am a strong candidate since I met all the requirements and I have the right experience to quickly adjust and, therefore, make an impact. 

My concern is that my application was not even read due to the many you received. So, I am afraid I did not have the possibility to talk about my credentials since I just received a common automated email. I would be at once happy and determined, if I had the possibility to talk with an HR specialist. My consideration about J&J will not change regardless. Thank you so much for your time beforehand. 

Best,

How about you call people back
"How about we get a response sometime even if it's negative instead of letting us hanging? You don't even provide the reasons for refusal and provide no feedback at all when other recruiters do. It is a lack of respect for people's time to leave them hanging for months on end with no response or comment or anything, we need quick enough responses because while we try to get in the group because it's a leader, we frankly got some self respect, dignity, and other things to do."

"Hopefully J&J will take responsibility and select recruiters and external supports for upcoming activities with an extreme sensitivity and more elevated and exagerated interest than in the past, to avaid extraordinary efforts on either sides and to fullfil the J&J credo: ""All companies ... are focusing on rules, which General Robert Wood Johnson has already written more than 60 years ago. The management should be guided and operated by the parent company Johnson and Johnson (Corporate) to comply with superbe social responsibility and non-profit-making as the basic principles of corporation by the decentralized organization.""

"Hi,
I understand that it is difficult to give feedback to all candidates who apply. However, it would make a tremendous difference for candidates to understand where their weaknesses are and in order to work towards achieving the requirements that are needed to work in a renowned organization like J&J.
At the moment, I still don't understand why my profile was not considered, given my background and experience. But I am less likely to come back in the future and apply for a role at J&J that may be even more suitable, because I don't know what J7J is looking for.
My recommendation would be to reach out to experienced & qualified candidates and provide honest feedback to candidates that have been recommended for a role by an internal J&J employee.
I'd be delighted to get your honest feedback in case this changes your mind. My name is Alexander Metlewicz (alex.metlewicz@gmail.com) and I applied for the Business Insights Manager role that you just posted on linkedin again. I'd be happy to share my latest CV with you if this is an option.

Sadly my experience of the recruitment process hasn't been as expected.  
I had applied for a role using an agency and received an email asking me to verify the information submitted on my behalf.  I logged straight on to the portal and somehow managed to lock my newly created account.  I followed the instruction and contacted your support team but sadly never received a reply to my email and calls.  This in turn meant that the deadline passed and my application remained incomplete.

I would hope that you use this information to ensure other potential employees receive a better and more streamlined experience."

"Hello, 

The ranking is low because the ""recruiter"" which is referenced in the questions above is not a human being which is customizing and tailoring the communication with the applicant. I received a system generated e-mail a few days after the application was submitted thanking me for considering J&J. Well, was it that I did not have enough experience in compliance and the 7 years in the current pharma company are not relevant, was it that the salary expectation was too high for this job? How knows? 
You should be aware that all these people which are applying to the jobs you post are expecting some sort of attention and personalized assistance. 
And why is the salary expectation a mandatory questions? Isn't it too early in the process to ask about money? Maybe I am a dreamer and still believe the chemistry between a employee and employer should superseded any other material consideration which you ask now before even personally meeting the person behind the screen.

All the best and may you attract the highest potential which is out there!

Personally, I just wish the process was fast, transparent and clear; fast, because a long process is tedious.

"Good morning,
I have no idea on how J&J do the sorting on their process but I do know that my CV matched every single requirement there was for the position I applied to. This happened two times and in neither of them was I contacted. 
I assume the correct person was hired but non-the-less, it feels a bit too discouraging to acknowledge that someone wasn't considered because their CV wasn't even reviewed. 
Maybe shortening the period on which J&J are accepting candidacies or having extra people involved in the sorting process could be a solution. Without knowing the process itself it's hard to know the real problem. 
It's extremely interesting to see J&J taking this survey because it shows willingness to improve, not only through the people you take in, but also with feedback from candidates that did not succeed in their applications. 

Job well done."

I understand you must get a lot of applicants but by giving more constructive feedback, you could help me learn what sort of J&J roles might best be suited to me given my skills and experience, By helping me learn and optimizing my chances of success, in turn you help provide a more positive experience and therefore I am more likely to have a positive view of the company and its brands."

As I have previously worked for Johnson & Johnson I have good experience in working for Vistakon but for every position  I apply for I'm deemed unsuccessful and I don't know why and they give no insight on how to fix where I'm going wrong or give me an explanation as to why I'm not successful.

Get in touch.
"Get in touch with very high potential as me in person and avoid taking shortcuts based on prejudice, public available or non available data or simply resume editing. When someone like me contact JnJ for this kind of positions please offer at least a personal or e-line interview to know the candidate better."
Get in touch with people who apply and even if they are not selected make them feel part of the process 
Get in touch to communicate if the applicant is still in the process or he has been  dismissed 
"Get in contact. Be communicative, be open. If this reflect on the workplace at all then you are in trouble."
"Get in contact with the status of candidate applications and actually tell them that they have been unsuccessful, rather than assume it from a survey they have been sent. "

Get back in person via telephone and talk about the position. 
Get a new recruiter. 
Get a feedback to the candidate.
"Geri bildirimleri daha hızlı ve daha açıklayıcı olabilir. Ayrıca tecrübeli kişileri keşfetmek ve tanımak için ilk mülakata davet edebilirsiniz. Çünkü insanlardaki cevheri gözlerine bakarak yüz yüze konuşarak daha iyi ve doğru keşfedebilirsiniz !!! Tabi bu benim nacizane fikrim. Bilgilerinize.

Gave me opportunity than we will talk about that. 
"FYI - I never received any direct contact regarding my application - no assessment, interview or feedback on my application.  This is the second survey I have received.  "
fyi
"From what I have seen, my resume has not been read since the response given by the recruiter is seen as a response standard."
"From the high reputation that a company as J&J has, it should not be an option to don't give any feedback at all after an interview where the interviewed has taken time from his/her current job to assist to this interview."
"From one side, I appreciated to receive an answer about the hiring team choosing not to pursue my candidacy for the position. On the other if the answer comes at less than 24 hours from applying, it indicates that my candidacy was even not taken seriously, specially if the answer is an automatic and impersonal e-mail with no reasons.

This certainly discourages the professional to apply for other job openings that could be posted as it confirms that without the personal approach it could be a waste of time for both sides.

A best practice from companies is to contact briefly to know the motivation and why the candidate considers himself a good fit to the vacancy due to the fact that a 2 pages CV can't indicate with all the extend the experience and skills for a very specific position. I'm aware about the workload of recruiters and the possibility of high amount of applicants, on the other hand and specially when the position is supposed to be senior/executive and therefore the applicant has also a certain seniority, it could be interesting from the recruiter and respectful to the applicant to know what he/she can means for the success of the position and company.

Yours faithfully

"From my point of view, the recruiters should have more knowledge about the sector. But I suppose it is difficult as J&J is a big multisectorial company"

For while is enough!
"For this position I was a really Qualified person, and in this can I feel discriminated for my age. There can not be many people having the different  (DMPK, ADME) skill-sets that I do have, there of the low score above. After working 8 years at AstraZeneca I have a learned the correct way working in the Pharmaceutical industry, it just sad it i sent appreciated."
"For the sake of transparency, I think that recruiter should phone contact with job seeker and clearly demonstrate a reason why he is not a good fit for the position he applied to."
"For some positions, an automated email saying that you did not qualify would not be enough for people to improve their skills.
You may need to narrow down your selection criteria in order to reduce number of applications, whenever you want to avoid contacting people to give them feedback."
"For some application looking at profile requirements I met the expectation  but I didn't have the opportunity to partecipate to the selection process.

I suggest to introduce objective KPIs to comunicate to the candidate in case of not good fit for the position eg:
     % of matching respect to experiences/expertise
     % of matching respect to potential of candidate
     % of matching respect to other requirements

In this way the candidate can know if he applied for something not in his scope."

The boss (decision maker) refused to attend to my presentation, so I had to present to someone that I clearly convinced but who was not going to be in a position to give me the job. After receiving a template email to tell me that the answer was negative I wrote a nice email to the PM and the recruiter (not mentioning the mascarade that went on) to ask feedbacks.... no answer. I am appalled. This is very unprofessional especially coming from a big name such as j&j. "
"For me, I can say that I don't have any idea on what Jhonson & Jhonson recruitment process do to hire new employees in your company since I didn't even receive a call from your side.

But, maybe I can suggest that the recruitment department should call and invite for the prospect employees  they want to hire for the company, instead of sending the survey form and asked to take a survey ""How the recruiter contacted me, even I don't receive any call from your side.""

Thank you very much.

"For me there was a sincere lack in even having a recruitment process.
I contacted the recruiter myself to get some additional information about the job. a few days later I contacted the hiring manager myself. Throughout this time, i didn't received any updates from the recruiter / hiring manager.( except the automatically generated emails from the recruiting system.  Afterwards i received a standard email (also automatically generated) that i was not the right candidate for the job. Again, without any explanation or reasoning behind it. "
"For improving recruitment process it is desired continiously receive through e-mail information about new suitable positions. Sometimes it is not easy to select appropriate position proposed on site by myself, for example, if some criterias are not match required knowledges or skills (the same time J&J ready to hear me on position and develop missed knowledge).
1. After receiving a result of consideration, that I have not been selected for applied position, i have sent e-mail to Talent Acquisition Coordinator and Hiring Manager with kind request to give me very short feedback or recommendation what I should improve in nearest future to match any equivalent position in J&J.
As answeres were not received, I did conclusion for myself, that J&J have not option, what allow sent such feedback to candidates, and think mentioned J&J representatives followed an J&J procedures.
The same time I received recommendation:
""We will retain your candidate file in our database and may inform you of job openings that match your profile if you selected this option. We also invite you to visit the Career Section on our Web site regularly"".

First response after confirmation of receipt of application documents was the rejection...five months later despite being recommended to a J&J recruiter by a peer. Too long.
first reply why dont select me and if not why  dont contact me i had applyed around 20 times but no one reply or no feed back
"First of all: the recruiter called me in the moment when I couldn't talk, so he told me to call him later. When I called him, he said that he has a meeting in 5 minutes, but he will call me back in one hour (understandable). And... he has never called again. So I tried to call him and try to arrange a new phone interview - he never responded.  Thanks to this situation my opinion about recruitment process is (as i mentioned already in the survey) worse than bad (to be honest I regret that you don't have a minus scale)."
"First of all I never got a call from J&J. I dont know why I am asked to go for this survey. I had applied for this role but I was never contacted through phone or even email. I am unsure that I should be really part of this survey.

Thanks,

first of all I had to wait 2 months until I heard from J&J. Then I finally reached the responsible person who just said that they haven't even started the recruiting process. Another month later I just got a standard refusal. So that was my experience and I do recommend applying for a job at J&J again.
"First mail you receive is better to Be a job interview , not something to notify you ' you re not a fit for us ' . 
To make myself understood i let you know , i don t have An appointment with J&J, but i will appreciate if that in the future i will have this meeting"
First invite the person in question or interview the person at least in person. After two months I received an email with negative decision. No problem there will be other opportunities. But the thing is the position is still available on internet. So I am a bit disappointed on the selection and recruitment procedure as there is so much work to do!
"First and foremost: please read the applications.

"First - you should answer for application. Personally, not by automated system. I expect feedback, why my application does not fit your expectation. My experience is very rich and I can not put it all in CV. Simply talk will be much more usefull than reading my application only."

Feedback would be helpful - even after a specific request for feedback I got no response. Now I have to wonder if I should apply for other roles or not as I do not know in what areas I was not deemed suitable. Disappointing from a company with such a positive reputation

Feedback has to be personal and not just standard.

Feedback about recruitment process is very poor. Only basic information via email that recruitment team has decided that someone else willl be the better Candidate. Looking for response time it's not something strange for me. Anyway thank you for this survey.

Incredibly off-putting, especially considering the time invested by applicants to go through the J&J application process. 

Then have the cheek to send a survey with the vapid line ""Johnson & Johnson Talent Acquisition team is committed to providing a high-quality candidate experience."" Who do they think they are fooling? ""High-quality candidate experience""? Laughable.

I've applied for (and been offered) many positions and J&J has hands-down been the worst experience. The worst part is that many of my friends applied to J&J also and were treated the exact same way. It's common decency to a) Give an idea of when to expect a reply after submitting an application, b) Offer feedback if requested, or at the very least, don't outright refuse to receive emails, and c) Take less than 5 months to filter out the first batch of applicants. It seriously took 5 months for your company to filter my application out from the first round???!!

Ensure that structured interviews are used rather than open discussions of just CV. As just using open discussion with no set questions makes it impossible to assess candidates fairly. Also taking notes at the interview would be a good idea. Plus feedback was very ropey and was quite ageist. Not changing interviews at short notice would be good.

Early responses
Earlier feedback (for anyone to get back to me almost 2 months)
Earlier face to face interviews
Eager to join the J&J family as its a dream company for me to work with. Looking forward to hear from you. The automated process with registration though has been easy. But the system should not become robotic as recruitment still I believe is a process of building the human resource which is the most critical element in the company.
"During the recruitment process responsible recruiter requested for the feedback from the HR partner that was responsible for the IT department when I was a part of J&J. Unfortunatelly for me I had quite bad relations with this person so it was imposible for me to receive a constractive feedback. On the other hand business departments and all the functions always provided positive feedback (and still do) about my job in J&J (as a result of my job I got sevelal Gold, Silver and one Platinum Encore Awards, two Most Valuable Support Awards). Besides I still help J&J with the support of their IT portfolio. Based on foregoing it seems to me that I got negative feedback just because of my controversies with the BBHR. If recruiter requested for the feedback from Managing Director, HCCO, Shared Services Director  and plenty of supervisors, he could get a more constructive feedback from people I worked with (in fact I have never worked with the HR partner during any projects, I've never discuissed my development or problems with them, so no feedback from them can be provided).
To summarize, my CV and me experience is in full compliance with the requirements described in the job so I believe that in the process of recruitment, my candidacy was wrongly rejected based on preconceived opinion, I have not received any communication from a recruiter of rejection or acceptance of my candidacy. I believe that the final decision had to be made only after a personal interview, which would rightly appreciate my skills and personal qualities. 
This approach discredits the name Johnson & Johnson, the company's credo and HR brand."
"During my recruitment process I have just received one email in standard format that says - I am not suitable candidate for the company without specific reasons.
To improve the process company could contact candidates and clarify points that are not clear in the CV - in that case as a candidate I would notice that i was considered for the job.
Thank you!"

I think the Human Resources Department should focus on the experience before examining the resumes according to the applicants schools.

"Dear Sjoerd,

Thanks for sending me the survey.

Considering that I was regretted for the following 3 roles (Cls Emea Strategy & Deployment Senior Project Manager (000018I8), Category Manager Sales & Distributor Services (0000191J) and Senior Director - Logistics & Distribution Central (000018GV) I am not sure where the problem lies - is my profile per my CV really not suited due to not having all the correct key words within it? 

Or am I honestly a poor candidate for any of the roles? Or is there something wrong with the recruitment process?

I don't have these answers, but am not convinced in the online applications, especially receiving automated answers of regret. My experience is that you have to know the hiring manager in order to be considered, or have your CV tailor made for each role that one applies for.

Apologies for the directness, however I do believe this is something worth discussing further.

Are there any problems in extricating the content from the bulk of CV's?

It would help senior candidates like myself to first of all get a chance to discuss their profile, the reason I applied was first my positive view of the company, but more importantly, my experience which I saw was a very good fit for the position.
I do understand that other candidates may be better suitable, but how can a recruiter tell without a proper interview? 
Feedback would also be very meaningful for me to know what I can improve or address to be a better fit next time.

1- Try to interview proper candidates.
2- Give feedback whether positive or negative.

Many thanks for asking my feedback on the process. I have applied for a position through company website and been informed that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue my candidacy within three hours after my application only.

Soon after the delivery of such information, I have started to receive several e-mails from Johnson & Johnson to take the survey regarding the recruitment process on an extensive basis.

"Dear Sir,
This is from my personal experience. I understand that initial automated screening is essential for any globally recognized company, where recruitment is a large scale and expanded process. But, I would like to suggest that this automated software should be made much more robust in order to consider the candidature. For example, in the case of scientists/researchers where an individual may have a different interdisciplinary background but has worked in the relevant field should be considered. There may also be a situation where some researcher has done a basic research, the application of which is in different companies like oil and gas, cosmetics, medicine etc., but just because the software couldn't identify the role/keywords in somebody's profile, the individual is not shortlisted. Please understand that everybody doesn't have a personal connection to forward the application.
I expect that the above point would help the recruiters improve their initial automated screening process. Thanks for considering my viewpoint.

I dont think it has a transparent recruitment process for jobs. if it has why I am not selected for a position.

Thanks and best regards,

"Dear reader,

I´m interested in J&J, but was disappointed of the process. Though quite possible, that my profile does not meet the expectations set by by the recruitment team, it would have been interesting to know why.

Without knowing this I´d never apply for another job at J&J anymore, as it would always be a stochastic process.

Best wishes,

Nothing happened.

"Dear Mr. Gehring, 

this is the second time I fill in the survey. As already written in my first survey I filled in about two weeks ago, I mentioned that I was a bit astonished that I did not received a hint of a reason why my candidature was rejected. In my opinion there Johnson & Johnson could improve. The candidates take some time to apply for a job with Johnson & Johnson. 

N.B. especially when you upload documents it is written up to 3 documents. In fact you only can upload one. Later you can sign in and upload a second document, but not a third. This is confusing.   

I hope my feedback is helpful. 

Best regards

Roland Rebmann"
"Dear Mr Gehring, thank you for this opportunity to express my personal feedback.

 If a candidate apply for opened vacancies continuously and is a former loyal employee with just a great track record of results, it would be great decision to contact him via directly and provide him a honest feedback, -  why he is not considered.

It is just strange for me that I left JnJ as a Salesman of the year (JJM 1996) and double promoted Sales manager (1996, 1997), Executive director of JnJ Slovakia (1997 - 1999) and I am treated just by ""cold and impersonal SW answer.

JnJ is just a great company."

"Dear J&J team, 

Recruitment process involve applicants who are human, that is why a telephone conversation would be better than an automated email especially with senior position, i.e. I received the automated email which confirms the receipt of my CV on 12 March and I received the email which informs me that another candidate was selected on 13th March. For an HR professional honestly does not make scene! This gives the impression that a candidate was selected long time back and the advertisement for the post was just part of the process to satisfy.
Moreover, the CV gives only 20% information about the candidate, the phone and the face to face interviews give more in depth information about the candidate.
This should be done in a more human (phone or face to face) and professional way as sometimes technology does not help in giving the full picture.
Thank you.,

"Dear J&J team,

thank you for taking the time to email me asking me to provide you with my feedback regarding your recruitment process. it's obvious that you are a professional company and this is one of the main reason that encourages me to apply on jobs at J&J . I will be very honored to work with company like yours if i have the chance one day. 

the only thing that i would like you to do to improve the recruitment process is to provide any candidate with the real reason whether & why he was not a good fit or a good fit for the position he applied to.

thank you again.

"Dear Friends,

I guess this is not easy to answer. Depends on peoples behaviour and reaction to the feedback out of the hiring process. 

I allways like personal feedback to improve my skills. For me it was difficult to figure something out when I got the Information that ""others match better"" for the open position. 

I would love to work for J&J in the sourcing area. But without big experience in pharma industry I guess I will have no chance to enter. 

Thanks

"Dear auditor,

    I have applied to several positions at J&J over the last year and never received one single opportunity reply but an email.

    The position of Director was probably the worse case since I did not hear from your services for a very long time. I wasn't expecting any answer anymore when I received a negative email.

    Of course, I might perhaps not have been a good candidate although I had absolutely all requirements to my point of view and am a neighbour of your company.

    I connected to one of your colleagues, responsible of talent acquisition. He confirmed by email the quality of my profile. This led to no interview.
    I know from connections inside the company that the recruiter was overloaded and I gave up trying to get an opportunity to introduce myself in person.

   Having been expatriated in Cincinnati for several years, I met friends from J&J there and had the best positive point of view on the company. 
   This probably helps keeping a positive point of view today still.

   I keep in mind that the employment market is difficult and that there may be hundreds of candidates for one job posting.

   Yet, I still would suggest a systematic interview of locals when they have the right potential profiles. Who knows, maybe gold is at your feet?

   If not, then maybe the CV recording process could be simplified for the candidates?
   With Linkedin, Jobsite and other websites, what value added does recording one CV in your own database makes? 
  On the candidate's point of view, it is days of work to get recorded and updated within all company databases and social medias, making probably most of your data obsolete in months.

   These are constructive thoughts which I hope can help you in your continuous improvement process.

Kind regards,
Franck Lombardo

"Dear all,
My suggestion is just be polite and reply to our applications! 
Each time that I contact Johnson&Johson I have no enthusiasm, not for the company that J&J is but for the absence of the human and direct contact. It seems that all is menaged from sw (i.e automatically reply).
It's a petty because, from my point of view, the human resource is one of the most important treasure in a company

"Bonjour. Je pense qu'il serait bien de donner une explication sur le refus de candidature autre que vous ne correspondez pas au profil recherché car pour ma pars et ne pas paraitre déplacer, ayant plusieurs expériences dans le domaine de industrie avoir toute les capacités et la motivation pour effectuer le travail demandé. Je pense que les curriculums sont une bonne choses mais que cela ne relate pas réellement les compétences et qu'il serait bien de donner l'opportunité à les personnes consciencieuses de montrer leurs motivations à travers un entretien ou un essai. Cela n'enlève en rien le professionnalisme de cette entreprise qui figure sur votre site. C'est d'ailleurs pour ceci que j'ai postuler. Ce n'est par ailleurs que mon simple point vue. Ayant 23 ans je n'ai aucune compétence dans le domaine de recrutement mais sans prétention je pense en avoir de bonne en productivité. Cordialement."

I was really convinced that I had the right skills, drive and experience for the function and I was also referred by one of your employees, so not being invited for an interview without any explanation surprised me and was a little bit disappointed. Knowing the reason can put this in another perspective.  "

"Before applying to your company I was persuaded you had an excellent HR talent acquisition team. 

I have been interviewed by a kind well mannered recruiter for a junior position within your company. According to her I had all necessary skills for the position and much of motivation to become a member of your company. I was told I was going to be interviewed by the higher manager the following week so I waited for 2 weeks without any contact from your part. I even sent an email to the recruiter asking her for updates in my candidacy. She never responded.

I'm a qualified MSc business psychologist speaking 3 languages and with this huge motivation to enter into a structured working environment without even minding to start from the lowest position and advance later into the company.  

I think that giving false information and not responding to your candidates isn't appropriate for a company such as yours.

Both recruiters I talked with were very kind. I'm wondering however are you honestly searching to recruit new people ? I will try to talk about this via your social networks with Mr. Sjoerd Gehring.

Thank you again for your time and consideration."
"Before applying for the Role, I compared the Job Requirements against my own Skills and Experience, and came to the conclusion that I was a pretty good match.  Even my physical proximity to the Job Location (Schaffhausen, Switzerland) was favourable.
I was therefore disappointed that Johnson & Johnson / Cilag AG did not provide more detailed feedback (except the automated mail informing me ""that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position"").
This leaves me wondering whether my application was handled personally, or only as part of an automated process.
It also leaves me wondering why I was not suitable for the Role, and/or whether I missed something when looking at the Job Requirements."
Because I did not participate in such a process I cannot fairly comment it.

Be transparent and give infornation even though it would be automatic. Just inform what is going on!

Be more transparent about the reasons why - I received a mail saying I was assessed as not a good fit for the business;) which left me perplex.  This mail in particular ( for a job in europe) was also sent without job ref number and as I had applied for several jobs in your system I was wondering wether it was an overall rejection for all or for one in particular.

"Be more specific on its recruitment process and its results, give detailed feedback and not to decide only on an online assessment"
Be more specific of what exactly I didn't meet within crieteria. It could have been I'm a non Swiss citizen or whether it was because I was the role would not meet my salary expectations (current salary etc) or whether it was because the role was filled by an internal candidate (a known quantity). As on paper my cv I  thought I had all the experience and necessary qualifications that would ordinarily put me in for at least a 1st round interview. 
Be more specific in their emails
"Be more selective of the recruitment companies you choose to represent you in the future- G2 Healthcare- very poor candidate experience - consistently had to badger to get any follow up, this experience was typical for another post they sent me for with J & J 6-7 years ago- they sent me then at the wrong time. Your telephone interview worked well & your lady was very charming. However it then took weeks to organise an interview, which was cancelled then rescheduled. The interviewers were very pleasant but somewhat robotic in their questions & approach - as I was the last interview of the day- they had probably given up the will to live at this point! It would have been good to get some feedback , I pursued this through G2 - but never got a response. Perhaps your department should take more ownership of relaying this information back in a more timely manner. Overall - J & J are an attractive company to work for but do appear to take a long time to react- I don't feel this fits your core credo value of treating potential employees with respect & value- I had rushed a long way from an appointment & researched the position well- I walked away still not feeling as though I had any idea of what the job entailed. At times I felt uncomfortable during the interview with the intimacy between manager & co-worker- it's good to show mutual respect for each other however I felt the manager was a little to overboard which came across as a bit insincere."
"Be more respectful of candidates' schedule and overall responsiblities. My recruiting process in Egypt was extremely disrespectful to my current job back then and my career in general as they told me I'm accepted and based on it I gave my notice to my old employer. However they din't contact me till 8 months later which caused me to stay unemployed for at least 2 months. 
I was highly excited to join the J&J team however a place that doesn't resprct its interested candidates like this isn't a place I would want to join.
More professional standards and ethics are needed when dealing with job seekers."
"Be more proactive. Contact your candidates, in case of negative or positive response, and explain. Try to involve more your candidates. Maybe one candidate wouldn't be a fit for the job, but with right incentive or advice, he could obtain the correct competencies for that or futures jobs. Or he could be a fit for another job in the future, and with the lack of follow up, he may decline your offer"

"Basically considering I have been a member of JnJ for 24yrs and I felt that I had relevant skills and experience I would accept some feedback on why I never got an interview 

This is not frustration; this is my motivation t learn of i have development oppprtinities to be cinsiders for these roles. "
"Based one my experience, it's better to let the persons know about their applications process and their future plans."
"Based on the job decription and my backgound which perfeclty match with requirements proposed, the least you could do is to provide some sort of feedback why I was not selected for an interview. As such, it left rater bitter feeling about the recruitment process and relationship between employer and ""potential"" employee. "
Base on the requirement for the position; I was expecting more communication with the RH dept. instead of an notice email mentioning that my application was not selected. I was (and still I am) quite disappointed to not being selected but most of that of not being informed of the reason of the refusal; much more disappointed when the job advertisement is still available on the website.
"Avoir des réponses plus rapidement au niveau recrutement..

"Avoid to use a standard reply, but give the clear reason why an application was not considered for the position. "
"Avoid sending the automated answer without reviewing the application. I applied to a role and got the automated email despite I am currently working on a very similar position in Unilever. 

Or request only the LinkedIn profile for applications that way the candidate doesn't spend much time to submit an application and an automated message is more acceptable."
Avoid automatic emails/answers recruiting process. Within few years you can expect same approach from candidates and you will not like it for sure! ;)

"Automatically generated emails aren't very pleasant to receive, specially when you had no phone screening. It feels like the profile haven't been reviewed at all.
This feedback survey is though very appreciated, sounds like the J&J is in a continuous improvement approach."
"Aucun feed-back individuel sur mes candidatures (j'ai postulé 3 fois) que ce soit par mail ou téléphone.
Process totalement dépersonnalisé ne prenant absolument pas en compte l'individu.
Sur quels critères un candidat est retenu ou non? 
Juste un CV? 
Etrange et pour le moins surprenant pour une compagnie comme celle-ci et que je connais bien (5 ans chez Janssen) 
Janssen s'inscrivait justement dans les valeurs humaines, l'échange, le respect, la curiosité..Mais cela c'état avant..Sans doute"
"Atleast send an email about the status of the application(s) made for positions advertised.  
I have not received any communication for 3 of the 4 applications I made."
Atleast reply on my submissions...
Atleast give a chance to experienced candidates to apply for positions abroad
Atleast feedback that would be great
Atleast all the candidates should get the response.
At-least contact candidate before coming to final conclusion because in India so many talented people are working for those post which are not for there category.
"At this moment, I have nothing to add."
At the very least a job interview would be nice.
"At the moment we are driving into a direction into which I feel current employees are not treated with the respected they deserve and J&J is not taking enough care of them. In Switzerland I don't see that J&J supports current needs of employees (flexible working hours, part time, working from home, etc.), hence J&J is surprised not being able to find the right talent! If we would take better care and support current talent we could retain a lot of knowledge and the reputation of J&J in Switzerland would increase again.

Why should I recommend J&J to friends and family, if I don't feel treated fair and with respect?"
At the moment there is no relationship built with the client. I received 2 automated emails. One to acknowledge receipt of my application (August) and one to tell me I was unsuccessful (Jan). Two automated emails 5 months apart is not a great candidate experience.
"At least.. Try to contact with the candidates..
I applied for several offers and I didn't have answer..."
"At least, write me the reason of refusal."
"At least, keep the process... even for typical reasons! And provide a constructive feedback..!"

at least to read cv
"At least to provide feedback on whether I have been accepted for the position or not. As I had my interview over a week ago with no response.

"At least an interview (phone, Skype, or face-to-face)"
"At least a candidate spending time ""preparing an answer"" to a job Ad, deserve an explanation on the reason why he/she doesn't fit.

"At least , it should give a feedback about the process"

Because if you do this the participants will apply again absolutely relevant Johnson & Johnson job positions after they improve their weak skills . 

For example i really want to know what is the result of my application and how it is evaluated? if the hr and technical personels had fed back me in someways as i mentioned above , i couldn't have lost my interest the Johnson & Johnson."

"Assess and improve your application review process and related communications with potential candidates...

"Asking the candidate employment status.
If the candidate is unemployed, the Recruter should propose a role different from the experience of the candidate."
"Ask questions, that have some kind of sense."
"Ask for industry experience on the job application otherwise applicants from outside of the industry will be misled to think they have an equal chance, when in fact they are probably in the 3rd tier. "
Ask for a video from the canditate with questions that the company would like to be answred in order to have a more reflective image of the candidate's personality.

As the candidate who participate in the process take the time and interest for the company job offer... should receive the return.

"
"As normal, sell your ascendants bodies to get more money"
"As no one will contact the applicant, concerning the status of her/his application, the process of recruitment or hiring is taking much time. I do know due to high volume of applicants for one particular vacant position, it might take time for the hiring manager to short-list the best candidates among the applicants, but I felt clueless as i really do not know what's going on, and what's is the real reason behind my rejection; to whom I can follow-up or chase to get the reason of the rejection; as SCM-SME, supply chain processes will be the same, even though the product I will handle will be different from one industries to another, either it is consumer items, diagnostic equipment or spares or the likes. I do hope that recruitment/selection specialist was not only looking in my current position or let say in the first page of my CV, but the totality of my whole professional experience."
"As much real contact as possible, instead of generated emails. "
"As in most of recruitment processes, once the candidate does not move forward, the recruiter changes their behaviour and stops giving feedback, stops responding emails, etc.
This is too common with most of the recruiter, internal and external.
This is very bad for a company's image and leaves you suspicious for the the future.
Communication should always be clear and balanced - if you always contact a person by phone when you are still interested in the profile, you should do the same once you know the person in not suitable."
As I mentioned in previous survey the Student should be interviewed​ and fresher's are the ones who should get these opportunities which will help both organizations and fresher's as fresher's has minimal knowledge but you can teach them according to the requirements of company.
"as I already once was working in Depuysynthes and was involved in the merge into JnJ - I really can recommend a position in JnJ.

"As far as me concern, the process are seems fine. As I have not been selected any post., I have only these experience now. "
"As far as I'm concerned, the process did not gone so far. However, for the slight overview that I experienced the time to get an answer was pretty short. I only wish I had a deeper feedback on the reason why my profile was not attractive for the position. Or maybe some advises or recomendations.

"As an expert for ES, TA, Recruitment with more than 20 years experience and with high focus on TCE (from eg. HP) would expect better candidate-would be customer-candidate care.

Moreovere I see not very smart customer orientation of your coleagues, non efficient processes, as you are losing good candidates, possible customers and last but not least JJ goodwill. Because of your low level customers service orientationt you will lose not only me, but also whole my family and people around me as customers.
Sorry for that but I wanted to explain my feelings, and reason for such a low rating. My honest feedback will be valuable for you. Take it as my gift to you. I have invested to your company much more time and energy than you invested to me."

As a HR professional with ten years experience in the pharmaceutical industry I was sure that my application which I took time and effort in compiling would interest you. Quite the opposite - I applied on the Friday and by early Monday morning I had received a rejection. This to me indicates that you have computer scoring in process not individuals who can assess the talent that applies - just computer software that picks up key words. 
"as a HR Manager & Free lancer Recruiter , you should deal with professional recruitment agency located in Egypt for All Africa jobs , as Egypt Extremely deferential in every thing , Egypt have difficult criteria in selection , the recruiter should has a very good knowledge in HR ( Manpower planning , recruitment & placement , compensation & benefits based on the local market - local companies as bench mark -  employee relation , training & development , Labor Law , social insurance law , general laws , Dealing with the governmental bodies , legal requirement & joining formalities , End of services gratuity or end of services compensation .
so my advise : when your company decided to hire for Egypt or North Africa please deal with recruitment Agency in Egypt .

Another issue is the new customized and tailored posts we saw recently that really reflects a high level of unaccountability and bias towards some employees by name like the EM immunology commercial lead which was tailored to fit a PM manager making the location in Lebanon which is totally odd and not the case in any similar post and the recruitment process was such a fake one with a certain result which is totally against fairness ."

"Applied, and then I received a letter advising no further contact will be made as I was not a suitable candidate. 20 plus years planning experience so it would have been handy if a reason was given. I.e. language, age etc

Kind regards,"
"Applied to a role and got the generic ""not this time"" response. No worse than any other comparable business. If you wanted to differentiate yourself you could have a few template answers to give some form of feedback as to whether a person was on the right track or not at all."
"Applied through the website and received automated responses stating the application was received and then another response that on this occasion my experience does not fit the role and so not pursuing.  There was no contact with an actual recruiter and the feedback was vague.

However, it was good to receive communication that the application as not successful.  Several other companies, including my current employer do not send any response to state the application was unsuccessful so from that point of view Johnson and Johnson are better."
Applied several times for a position in Switzerland and have never been contacted even so my background would fit to the position (however I am not Swiss citizen but Austrian).
Applications for huge companies like J&J are extremely numerous and I am sure that the first selction crieteria is the most selective one. Having an automated primary exam (with job needed kpis) for all candidates for every designated postion can help them understand why they dont match and will help you reach to anbetter selection through scores.

Anything 
Anyone looking for a job takes time to consider the companies culture and fit because they could potentially be working there for years or most of their lives. Candidates take applying seriously. My experience was not pleasant due to the fact that l got a generic email to tell me l have not been successful bit didn't really explain why. I had always thought Johnson and Johnson was a great company but to be honest how you treat people goes a long way. I know my opinion will only fall on deaf ears but try make your recruitment process filter out people by group interviews which give people the chance to show why they could be a good fit for the role. Anyway I'm sure you have thousands of Cv s mine is just a number.

"Although the company has their recruitment process set to the needs suiting themselves, however, the entire book cannot be read or understood by reading only the first / last page. Same way, the candidate cannot be screened just on the basis of screening catch words of their resumes. My suggestion for the company would be to meet or have a conversation with the candidate who has applied for a job on the company portal and to understand the expertise the person has acquired over the years especially if the candidate fulfills the basic criteria of experience and background. Also, only seeking candidates working in the same sector / industry might not always be the correct choice as, other industry / sector candidates might have a lot to offer as they can also bring about a lot inter sector expertise which might give a new outlook to different aspects along with bringing best practices from other industries."
"Although my cv coresponds perfectly to the position's requirements, in 12 hours after submitting application I have received an automatic negative responce.

"Again, keep getting survey requests, but no contact about possible employment..."
After working for 23 years with worlds 7 best company I was surprised why I wasnt even called for an interview
"After the interview process I was informed that I did not have the required experience, this should have been seen from the outset and not requested me attend for interview. 
The interviewers were all very welcoming bar one who basically stated that I did not have the relevent experience and did not engage in the interview after that."
"After receiving the application, the recruiter should respond in any case, even if the candidate is not suitable for the offered position."
"After my application, I received within 4 hours a reply that my application has been discussed and the view is that it does not fit.

This gave me a clear insight into how the recruitment process is taking place and with standard mails the applicant is not shown the necessary respect. In 4 hours no one has examined an application and are resolved with the department. I will not apply to J & J anymore.

I work myself also in a larger enterprise and this is not a quality I would have expected. As an important Arbitgeber in Solothurn there would have to be more behind. 

Since contact person and telephone number are also missing, one can hardly be informed as applicants and clarify details regarding places.

These are my suggestions for improvement

"After initial automaten notification send email to inform about the procedure of the selection process and status of tha application.

"After I made my application there was nothing by email to say it was being considered and at no time was I contacted by anyone using any other means. However, a few days later I was invited to take part in your survey to give my thoughts on the application process and what I thought of the company.

I have now received this survey request, after some considerable time, and it is a unique way of letting me know that my application has been unsuccessful but hoping that I still have a positive perspective of the recruitment process! 

I think perhaps that there is too much focus on recruitment metrics here and not enough on the actual process. Not unusual."

"After careful consideration, we regret to inform you that you have not been selected for this position.

I myself was a bit stunned as I have countless years of experience in that position as stand alone as well as during my years as Head of Department Of Operations. But I just attributed it to the xenophobic and discriminatory atmosphere that exist here in Switzerland. Which is particularly sad being your company presents itself as a family oriented  all inclusive company. Which in parts of the world it may well be. However when it comes to Switzerland you only add to the current xenophobic discriminatory culture. And in doing so you not only waste the talents of people like myself,but many other ex-pats who are penalized for nothing more than where we originate from. Which is ironic being Switzerland is so quick to the point the finger at the rest of the world for their actions instead of simply .....looking in the mirror  "

"Adding a couple more sentences on explaining why the hiring team has chosen not to pursue my candidacy shouldn't be that difficult, but again, I realize recruiting team doesn't even know why either, because they've never seen my profile at all!  I've never heard or seen anyone getting hired from these career pools.  I believe a candidate spends time entering their information, to create a profile for 20 to 40 mins, and no one ever sees those profiles. It's a big waste of time for candidates, but I get it. It's a corporation, so everyone's replaceable. I don't believe ""acquiring the talent"" is an accurate term for the company's hiring practices; you might want to consider replacing it with ""Our career engine matching words to that your profile has and reaches out to 10 people and disregards everyone else"" - sounds more accurate I think.  It just sucks for people who are driven to succeed like me can't be seen through this practice... Tough world out there."

"Actually I've applied for 2 different positions on marketing team recently: on one of them the recruiter contacted me aksing me for apply for the next stage, however I couldnt be qualify since I'm from Brazil and the position that J&J was looking for a professional was for a person based in Europe. The recruiter was very nice and appologized for this mistake. However I got very frustrated and wasnt offered no other position that I could be considered to. I got very sad since I always wanted to join J&J team.
For the other times I've applied for others positions in marketing area, I only received an automatic repply thanking me for participating the recruitment process and that's all. So I never heard from J&J I wasnt quilified to pass trough a next stage on the recruitment process. I totally understand that J&J receive many acquisition request on the dayly bases, however since I'm applying since a long time it would be great having some feedback explaining why I couldnt make it. You should have on your data bases the profiles of those who frequently apply for a position on J&J.

"A) In my case for the particuIar role I was asked to give feedback for, above, I was simply sent an email saying I wasn't successful. I received it twice, the second time was salt in the wound I have to say.

B) Several months** before that, I was contacted as part of a pre-screening call. The interviewer told me he'd recommend me to be progressed to the next stage but I never heard anything back which was extremely disappointing. It's not easy being strung along like that, waiting weeks to hear anything. It was a former colleague of mine from Janssen who told me the job had been filled.

** I believe the person initially offered the job, turned it down and so recruitment began again.

C) I would recommend J&J because I've worked there twice before. I would not recommend them based on their interview process I have to say. On a previous occasion I was told I was going to be interviewed on March 17th. I changed my plans on what is a National holiday to make myself available for the phone interview. I waited and waited but the call never took place.

"A std answer like the one mailed is really poor, in consideration to the fact that most probably the candidate applying to the job, has dedicated at least 10/15 minutes best case to write a cover Letter and re-assessing the CV o out-mostly highlight what he think is important in his/her career that can be valuable for the job.
Now, I think that he/she deserve 5/10min to have an explanation of the exclusion for the ""fitting list"" explaining in what he/she does not fit."
"A standard pack to prepare the candidate would be beneficial. This might sound like giving them a helping hand, which it probably woule be, but it would ensure each candidate is set up for a successful process.

Secondly, the application form only states when I submitted the role. It would be better to provide information of what stage it is at, or when I may find out about the role.

Thirdly, the careers page is very difficult to navigate and not at all user friendly. Rather than having fancy drop down sections, keep it simple. The more simple the better."

"1- you need to do vacancy adds through Internet online active Web (ex. LinkedIn) why? Because candidate finds it convenient to log to one web/place/source and search for a job. And it is available and competing. Candidate needs a job now, not later at unknon time with his dream environment so candidate will feel less trust to fill a long application on every company's and then wait for unknown time until he may receive an non guaranteed interview call.

2- why you didn't recruit me? My CV is interesting. 

3- communicating via email saying that you'very not been selected BUT!! we will keep your record ......, is not nice and not helping!! If you really reviewed my profile then tell me why me not selected for at least the first interview. This can be helpful then I can develop that area for a next time vacancy."
"1- To focus on the Dynamic people regardless age.
2- To make double check on the all submitted CVs,as sometimes some of the recruiters are lazy to read alot of CVs and this is not fair and may Johnson and Johnson will lost a very professional candidates, one of them may change the future of the Company."
"1- Recruiter should at least inform the person on what ground he was not selected.
2- All the Organization including Johnson & Johnson should have a fair recruitment process, as in if an old employ / Managerial position have refereed some on some person in trust is hired.and the person who is really capable always wait for his turn which never comes."
"1- Off course verbal communications with all candidates is difficult but instead it would be better if there is feedback detailing the personal qualifications against the desired one .

"1- I encourage a direct contact with applicants and provide specific reasons why applicants have not a good fit. It is disappointing to receive a generic email ""We wish to inform you that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of Health Care Compliance Officer Pharma, Emerging Markets (1600134312W) at Janssen-Cilag S.A.

2- If you have the data (cv, background) of the applicants in your databases, why do you recommend/ encourage to continue to review the job openings posted on your careers web site?. I encourage to review your data base for candidates before a public openning of a job vacancy. Do you do it?
3- For a good transparency of the work of the recruiters, I suggest that when the vacancy is covered, publish in the website accesible for the registered applicants, the CV submitted by the applicant selected for the job with the characteristics requested in that position.
4- If you are discarding candidates by age, academic qualification....., you must be clear in the ads of employment and in the communication email. I am a professional with experience in the pharmaceutical & biotech industry with experience in different functions (+15 y) and my professional career was evaluated and positively accredited by national agencies, and I do not understand how is possible that in these last 5 years my background have not fit for any job position of low, medium and high qualification.

"1) I never received a reason why ""that the hiring team has chosen not to pursue your candidacy for the position of ...""?? You could tell me the reason. 

2) To make the talent list transparent. Everyone that submits CV to join your talents list should undergo a first assessment process (may be his/her profile is not ""talented"" and he/she is there to hide the brilliant candidates). 

3) The hiring committee should not be biased towards some nationalities (they are choosing their friends and relatives). It is not necessary that I connect with you on social media (virtual relationship) to get hired. I suggest to make a recruitment camp where you invite people from the NEW ""talents list"" to spend one week together (seminars and real social life).

4) You are a multinational, but the recruitment is always criticized. I am looking for job (I am not unemployed!) and I am hearing the unemployed people what they say about your hiring strategies!! 
Since you gave me this opportunity to tell you this, I will not lie or say you are perfect, because if you were, you wouldn't ask me!
I really like a lot of your products shampoo, soap,.... BUT, I strongly believe (after applying 8 times) that I was not chosen because of my origin, age or other hidden agenda... In terms of qualifications, I am the only person applying with such CV!!

In my particular case, 3 dates were given to me for the ""potential"" next steps. Since I already work, I had to take 3 days of leave (since I was very serious about applying at J&J). I had to sent mails myself to the recruitment team to find out more than a week later (when already 2 of the 3 dates passed) I was not selected. Which I fully respect but FYI, I also have only 20 annual holidays of which I wasted 3 to the incompetence of the recruitment team to take 2 minutes to sent me a mail.

Five years of intense mathematical training at University (Master Degree in Economics), previous work experience, language and social skills are worth nothing, since I am not fast enough at solving your relatively simple online numerical test. This outcome is very disappointing for me. First, who guarantees that the successful candidates did the test themselves or whether they had help from others? Second, is a candidate who trains long hours in order to be fast enough at this test a better employee in the end? In my opinion, too much importance is given to this online assessment.  "

".As an internal candidate I found the process very poor. I waited for months for feedback after the 1st interview and had to follow up both with the HR rep and Hiring manager for updates. I received a second interview but again waited weeks/month before any feedback was provided.  Again that was initiated by my emails requesting updates and feedback. There were a number of times I was tempted to withdraw my application due to the unacceptable practices i.e. excessive waiting and no feedback observed throughout the overall process.

I was only told in the end that the role had been withdraw and never actually received any feedback on my own performance during both interviews?

There was too much stress test for a first interview. The first word manager said to me was: ""When I look at your CV, I see someone who does not know what she/he wants to do with her/his life!""

The recruiter person did not inform me about the process and people that I am going to interview with. There were 2 product managers in my first interview plus a recruiter. And all of them said things that I should not or cannot do this job. Then why did they invite me at all? They already saw my CV and my expertise areas beforehand, and then they are saying they would like to work with someone who did hardcore marketing instead of me at the end of the interview. Moreover that was a position for a 1 year experience required job and I already had almost 3 years experience and at least 1.5 year of it was ""so called hardcore marketing"". 

I am sorry to say that I wish I did not attend the interview at all. It was very discouraging for me and their attitude was very far away from being friendly. Also they come to my interview almost 30 minutes late with their starbucks coffee stuff (which proves that they were late, not because a reasonable cause) and laughing and without even apologizing for making me wait there. 

I can even say that it was the worst interview I have ever been. I am a very well educated person and I have been in lots of interviews from fmcg sector. I am sorry but it really was, even my friends were shocked I told them about this experience. I cannot work with irresponsble people with such attitude, even though I really like the products and branding of J&J very much... 

Thank you very much for asking my feedback. I really wanted to share my experience with someone who cares from J&J. 

Best,

"

The recruitment process should be clearer.  Furthermore, no job interview should be held unless a position is opened clearly. Candidates should be informed of the net result after the job interview has been held. A return as if the position was closed, does not fit into a company of this size."
"
Request a Skype contact when you are in the list of possible candidates suitable.
Thank you!"
"
Make contact with the applicant.

I applied for the position and did not receive any feed back or confirmation from J&J on whether or not I was being considered for the role or why I am not being considered for the role."
"
In my view, companies of the size of Jonhson should try to create a synergy with universities in the countries in which they are represented in order to be able to seek new talent, so they can innovate in all their operations. Another issue for Rh staff should not see their employees as numbers, but rather as their most valuable asset. They should never exclude people by age (beyond the age for the open position)."

Johnson & Johnson is a successful company, with a substantial knowledge of recluiting processes, so I believe that any kind of question to the candidate is useful for the purposes of assessment.
"


Q6.4
Accepted
What can Johnson & Johnson do to improve the hiring process?
Shorten times between verbal offer and actual offer. I had to wait almost a month in order to get the writter offer.
"I think it is key that the current manager get to know the offer earlier than the candidate, to better plan the transition from current to the future role."
"Written feedback following assessment day, the content of the Excel test. "
"HR Recruiting was efficient and timely.  Phone screen was fine.  The department's interview scheduling had very short lead times which was very stressful due to my travel schedule to customer sites.  

Would also recommend that HR also work to understand more of the benefits that are included in offer packages.  I had questions about LTI that HR couldn't answer.  Difficult to assess a 'package' if benefits aren't fully explained. "
"Make sure job descriptions are clear to 3rd party (no acronyms, or internal phrasing).  Ensure consistency of process across job postings- I interviewed for 3 different roles and had 3 completely different experiences in terms of recruiter contact, timeline, feedback structure, and interview process. "
"Overall, my experience was positive, but I did want to share one piece of feedback.  I understand that everything is moving towards automation and standardization, but it is quite weird when you've been an employee of J&J for 15 years and you get a ""Welcome to J&J"" email when you've accepted the offer for a lateral move down the hall from your previous desk.  It just reinforces the lack of personal touch.  It would have been much better to receive a note like ""Thank you for continuing your career with the J&J Family of Companies"" or something like that.  "
"Having worked in J&J for many years I was aware of the processes and I found everything quite straightforward. This is the second time I am changing role and moving to another country, I did a similar thing about 4,5 years ago and I experienced an improvement in the process. So well done!"
"giving candidates more information about the recruitment process, benefits and compensation etc in advance."
improved communication at interdepartmental matters regarding employee hiring process will help speed up the process .
Reduce the time to recruitment process.
I think current process is good enough.
To reduce a stages involved in interviewing process. Suggest to make not more than three stages.
The recruitment process was smooth but time taken to complete was longer.
reduce the amount of interviews and time it takes to be recruited. 
Maybe a written offer immediately after verbal offer and a little time to evaluate.
"since for the sales role in a big hospital, it takes extremely more working hours (7:00AM-20:00PM) than the previous office role, and there is no OT for the employees for flexible working hours, more allowance may enhance the satisfation of employees."
All around good job!
"Time taken between final interview and offer was way to long. If my manager hadn't of kept me informed, I could have quiet easily taken another role."
Nothing comes to mind at this time.
Better communication from the team managing the offer and on-boarding process.
I do not have any recommendations at this time.
"Be better equipped to deal with situations out of the ordinary - primarily by maintaining appropriate levels of communication and progress updates.

My situation was unusual in that I was both travelling on annual leave for 5 weeks during the recruitment process and my previous role was put at risk of redundancy during the recruitment process for my current role.

I missed my first interview (tele conference while I was travelling) due to the recruitment team not passing on my request to have my personal contact details used for interview scheduling. 

Following my first interview I heard no feedback for weeks from J&J recruitment team. When I followed up with them I was informed that I was no longer in the process as I was ring-fenced. This information was incorrect and I had to escalate the issue in order for it to be resolved. This was all done while I was on annual leave with limited connectivity and was incredibly stressful.

Had the recruitment team informed me of the status of my application sooner it could have been resolved much quicker and with less stress."
Less interviewers 
"Better communication. I haven't received a single message nor information for over a month after my application was submitted.
If for any reason the recruiting process is delayed, waiting for other actions, decision, the candidate should be informed that the application is not abandoned and only due to the circumstances it will take longer. Especially with internal candidates, who might understand the situation better. It is enough just to let them know."
The process could speed up a bit.
"First of all thank you opportunity in this survey. 
For me all recruitment process were extraordinary. J&J has a big opportunity in burocratic process (paper process) .
Thanks again, Paula"
Make the process shorter.
"Keep doing what you're doing. Great process, and I *loved* the joint interviews. It was my first experience with such a format, and I hope this spreads throughout the company. "
Very good and keep it up!
Very satisfied with the recruitment process. It was just the right time and the process was explained to me thoroughly. Keep the process as is and genuinely all possible candidates will be happy and be encourage to accept positions being offered to them by JJVC.
I think the panel interview was a bit overkill. But on the other hand it helps to pick the best among very good.
"Update letters with latest HR contact details. A letter that come with the contract offer advised me to phone a number to give Payroll my bank details, that number was no longer in service as the HR activities had been consolidated to the U.S.  The new number was on the phone message but the letters should be updated to account for this. Same with the email address for my passport scan."
The recruitment process was streamlined and flowed naturally.  I was informed of each next step in a timely manner.   
"The lack of consistent communication was alienating. Because of the long delay in between receipt of the verbal offer and written offer, I had a very difficult time setting up transition planning at my previous employer. Furthermore, none of the promised dates were followed (when I would receive feedback or further communication), and there was a lack of transparency about how much interviewing was required (multiple phone interviews after an in-person interview seemed odd). There was no clear ownership over my interview process, and I did not know who my SPOC was, and who to go to for specific questions. Ultimately, this disorganization in the recruitment process almost caused me to rescind my offer acceptance. I hope that we can clean up this process and take more of a stake in our prospective new employess, and focus on building and developing a sense of comfort and security, to make the prospective employees feel comfortable. Furthermore, the recruiters should be more knowledgeable about the retirement benefits; they could not answer my questions around the pension plan. For this reason, there was an incomplete data set which inhibited me from making a sound decision earlier on in the process, because I did not have the full picture. I had been promised to receive my offer letter by COB Thursday and received it the following Monday, when the deadline to reply was Wednesday. On top of that, there is no communication between the site recruiter and the global services team, and as a result, any troubles with the due diligence process were very hard to resolve. Overall, I think this process could use a good deal of work and organization. "
"Describe the role more clearly.  Make it clear whether the candidate is purely technical with no reports versus on a manager track with reports, and if managerial, whether there is a technical lead component.
Make sure all interviewers are on the same page and portray a consistent message about the role and team structure to which the candidate will be a part of.
Make it clear about the difference between PTO, personal days and family time.  It comes across as though it's all PTO effectively, but there is a ""with-manager-approval"" component to that.
Pay attention to when a candidate is in two separate job markets that are both within commuting distance, and account for that when making an offer.

With that said, glad to be here!"
"I thought Chris Pagotto was the greatest thing since sliced bread! He was enthusistic, energetic, and so upbeat and charasmatic on the phone. I truly believe that his demeanor brought out the best in me during the interview process. You have a very special and unique recruiter in Chris, I'm so happy I got the chnace to talk and work with him. "
no comments

Timelines my process last for more than 3 months.I guess as I have been contractor for over a year it will not make a huge difference however for person looking for a new role in different company it would. 
"I am really satisfied about the overall recruitment process. I am glad I am now going to join such an important group like this. Recruiters were very friendly and helpful. Moreover, they own a really good command of several foreign languages. Hence, it was very easy to communicate with them at each step.  "
"I believe it would be beneficial for both parties to have interview session with HR and later on induction about HR process including performance measurement, compensations & benefits, company's working hours, leave, systems and everything.."
By not freezing positions !
Everything is good.
"Reduce the recruitment time, sen constan feedback actualizations about the process, give more oportunities to the internal talent such as competitive offers like the company do to external apliers"
"Better transparency is the only improvement point. In my offer letter & discussions, it ws clearly discussed that my reporting would be to the plant head of baddi but after joining, my reporting in the system changed to engineering department within 2 days of joining. One of the major factor for leaving my earlier organisation was reporting structure, but surprisingly it ws changed without even discussing with me.
This is one of the major set back for me & I would like Johnson & Johnson to have better transparency & communication system regarding this.
Thank you"

"Offer package is very important and delicate factor in choosing job and yet most of Korean recruiters are not investing, or not willing to invest enought time to design the offer package to be attractive to the candidates and often ignore candidate's current package, trying to leveraging J&J name value. It can be benefiting the company for the short term, but this can affect both the talent's future growth potential within/outside of J&J and retention risk in J&J. "

"My case is unique scenario and I am not sure this will ever happen to other interviewers. After final round interviews, I was told the position has been put on hold. This not only frustrated the interviewer, but the recruiter and hiring manager as well. I will leave this to the HR department to find a solution. Over all, I am happy with the process, especially the main recruiter's timely responses and openness in terms of questions, answers and expectations. I will be happy to provide more feedback if necessary. Feel free to contact me."

The recruitment process was good there was not clarity into what my role was going to be a bit disappointing that most of my experience is product oriented and I don't have anything to do with product mostly paperwork and data analysis. 
"get rid of the recruiter. let the person talk directly to his or her boss about benefits. I almost decided to not join J&J just because of the recruiter.
either that or let the recruiter have the info on benefits. All mine was able to get was pay thats it.

"Truthfully the salary is still a little Low compared to other offers that a lot of the candidates had that I spoke with. Everything else was amazing, Johnson and Johnson is the best and I am so excited to work for them and the recruitment process defintely helped me realize this. "

Keep applicants regularly informed on updates after they have attended an asssessment centre and are awaiting the outcome.
"Let you know if a position is ""frozen"" or set on stand-by"
"1) Screening can be more interpersonal (i.e. friendlier); I felt interrogated instead of being interviewed.
2) Recruitment process is too lengthy; it will be great to reduce the time between first interview and job offer (which in my case it took about 5 weeks).
3) Will be worthwhile to follow up with candidate after interview to collect feedback about how he/she feels and thinks of the prospective employers and also provide detailed feedback from interviewers to help the candidate understand more about the role, work expectations and team culture.
4) Will be great to have HR talk about the on-boarding process after final interview so it sets the expectations accurately for the candidate."
"Overall I was impressed by Johnson & Johnson's recruiting process and thought the the recruiter did an excellent job explaining the role, benefits, and interview process."
"Respond and provide feedback in a more timely fashion, especially for internal candidates. I've never seen a company treat internal candidates so poorly as they try to progress their career."
"The on boarding was disorganized- too many hotline numbers to call and no One person could help or cared to help. ""Put in a ticket' was often the response."
Make sure that managers are contacting new hires shortly after offers are received and manager assignments are made.
Be more proactive in the hunting of professionals.
"I like that the offer and contract signing was done electronically which was very convenient. However, it took me roughly 3 to 4 months to join JnJ. Hopefully the recruitment will be faster for future shortlisted candidates."
"I would recommend follow up with candidates. Even if it is a negative response, it would be appreciated if a call or email was sent as soon as possible regarding outcome. "

"as an external candidate i was extremely impressive with how well the recruitment team did, the communication was timely and clear throughout the process. The only improvement I would recommend is when you have a 'super day' there should be more information about the specific people/roles you will be interviewing for ahead of time. "
The recruitment process was fine.  Once hired a benefits specialist would have been beneficial rather than just website links.  Someone to help explain things and show you how everything works and to review your fields insuring that everything is complete.

"IF YOU ARE READING THIS - PLEASE READ AND ADDRESS WITH YOUR SUPERVISOR!

I understand that this review may read as arrogant but I need you to understand the importance.

In my previous organization, I was the Senior Director of Supply Chain for $1.3 Billion worth of organizational assets, procurement, and distribution. I recently accepted a Manager position (for which I am extremely excited about!) but I need you to know that one 'Major Factor' into this difficult decision was due to a Senior Talent Acquisition Specialist named Heather Spuhler. She was nothing short of a superior professional in her field and spent a significant amount of her time answering my questions or following up on my behalf. I will seek her out for guidance and to collaborate around business initiatives in the future. Great Hire! "
Have better communication through out the process. 
"The were some details of the proposal that were not clear:
- Bonus and salary increase: it was not clear if they would be based on the last pay grade or the new one. On the telephone i understood that i would receive the merit increse and bonus based on the new position, but in reality the merit increase is the same for both pay grades and bonus was based on the previous pay grade. I understood that this would be an advantage and at the end was not.
- Car: i expected that i could change my car ASAP, but J&J has until 1 year to change it.
- Telephone: same as above

"The process was well explained and everyone was very pleasant to work with.  It was a long process, so condensing the timeline could improve the process.  I do understand there were many candidates and multiple positions so the fact management was taking their time choosing the best candidates for their team is understandable and appreciated. "

"Stay with the one recruiter throughout the entire process.  My initial phone interview was with one recruiter that was very pro-active in communication and kept me in the loop throughout the entire process, even when I hadn't heard from the second recruiter that was formulating the offer.  I had my final interview then didn't hear from the senior recruiter for over 3 weeks with my offer.  During this time I contacted my original recruiter because he was the only person I could get to respond, but he could not tell me much because he was not the one formulating the offer.  The hiring manager even reached out and contacted me after a two weeks of not hearing anything from my recruiter which I was impressed with.  

Moving forward in the future I would recommend that the recruiters remain the same throughout the process, this gives less confusion to the candidate.   "
"In my experience, other people in the department (not involved in the hiring process) knew I got the position before I did.  How does that happen?"

Following offer acceptance, there was little to no communication with respect to orientation to the company prior to start date.

Incredibly inflexible bureaucratic processes.  I was given the impression that this is not changeable.

"clear communication on interview process (timelines and steps), enough time to consider compensation package, clear communication and explanation of positions compensation base and the IC plan.

Incidentally, this is the third time I've been asked to take this survey (and have taken it).  I believe the first time was before I even had an offer.  Then I was asked to take it again a week or so after starting.  Two months later and the survey is in my Inbox once again.  "

Muito obrigado pelo empenho e dedicação em todo processo!
Ensure diversity amongst the individuals conducting the interview 
Improve feedback.  There was one point during the process where I did not hear back from the recruiter for almost two weeks.  I would have like to have had some feedback during that time.
I was impressed by how smooth and reliable the interviewing process was. J&J has a great  reputation and in my 2nd week in the office I confirm that that reputation is so well deserved. I have loved everyday at J&J. Thank you for having me!
Maybe should provide a competition salary.
"I had to do a ""fit"" interview with a colleague and someone that would report directly into my structure. I did not think this was a fair interview, the interviewer left with a snapshot of who I am without much context on my experience and company policies which set me up with a negative hill to overcome in my first interaction based on her perception and not reality. I don't think that set me up for success."
"Include names of specific team and lead to provide greater clarity for internal postings. In a company that is network-based, it is critical to know who is recruiting for the role to identify how to network for the opportunity."
The Notice Period of 3 months is too long
At this time I have no area for improvement for recruitment process.

Muy satisfecho con el proceso de reclutamiento
Better feedback on background check process
"I think the key factor to improve the recruitment process is to try to be as faster as it is possible to give feedback about each one of the stages to the candidates.

It took to long to receive news about the online group activity, for example."
The job description was very helpful in the interview process.  One area of improvement would be more specifics of the geography of the districts/territories  in said job descriptions.

"I never received a verbal offer. About 2 weeks after my 2nd interview, I received an email with an offer letter."

So thanks for moving the interview/hiring process along. Keep that up. Hiring shouldn't take several months.

Very minimal effort to negotiate compensation. 
Be more aggressive with compensation vs the marketplace.  Recruitment process itself was wonderful. 
"My process was different, for I was a rehire.  However, I have applied for positions in the past and it was a very tedious process.  The recruiter was always prompt, it was after that when things took more time and questions were left unanswered."
Increase level of communication frequency through various steps
More visibility of roles
Previous salary should not need to be disclosed.
faster and communicating current status more often
"The different steps of the recruitment took quite long from first interview to offer ( &gt;3months) but have to consider the Christmas break in between where many people probably had long vacation. 
Overall I felt very well informed and taken care of throughout the whole process. "
It took over 4weeks to receive the contract since the offer was verbally accepted. I feel that this time should be significantly reduced. 
Overall the Johnson & Johnson recruitment process is above average for an organisation of its size. I liked the way the values of Johnson & Johnson are made clear in the credo.
"Give earlier feedback after the application. 
In my case, I didn't get any news from J&J before more than 2 months. 
I thought I had simply not been selected for the interview process. 
So getting feedback also before the interview process would be very appreciated I think. "

Thanks!"
Existing processes are good to go. It would become more attractive if prospective candidates are ask to give ppt presentation on their past and current achievements and how they are going to add values if they are going to get selected. 
Not much I think the process works well 
"The recruiter I worked with did not seem to understand that I was transitioning from the field to an in-house role. At every step I needed to explain that I was going to face a significant increase in expenditures alloting for the differences in the role and new location - moving from San Diego, CA to Horsham, PA.  I needed to ask for an increase in compensation to purchase a vehicle, adapt the relocation package and request an increase in overall base pay to cover the increased cost associated with the new role.  All in all, the process left me with a bad taste in my mouth and made me feel very undervalued as an employee. My evaluations have always scored high and I'm the top 10% of my team and yet I seemed to have to prove my value at every step of the salary negotiations. I'm still unhappy about my base pay and it definitely has me re-evaluating my career devleopment at JNJ."
To notify the extra hours that we have to leave in the company and advise that bonus in the letter proposal will discount taxes.
Extremely satisfied.
"nothing that I can think off, the time between interviews had been influenced by both mine and the interviewers schedules and completely understandable. I have already recommended J&J to friends and I haven't even started yet "
"I really enjoyed the GOLD invitational event. Prior to the event, I would have liked a practice case study to better prepare for those events. I had primarily learned about the format of the GOLD invational interviews through the individuals I worked with on my co-op. I think that other candidates, particularly those who have never worked for Johnson & Johnson, could use more materials to prepare for the event."

Other than that, the overall process was organized & received timely responses from all involved parties. "

"The recruiter I worked with was very responsive and informative when I reached out to her.  

As an internal J&J associate, when I review job postings I am always interested in knowing who the hiring manager is.  Having access to that data point would be helpful. I'm sure there is a reason for this not being posted--and I understand that as well.  "
"Accelerate growth and promotions for young high performers. I've seen many exceptional young colleagues deliver amazing results year after year for J&J and then leave because the company is too slow to recognize them.

If we truly want to deliver exceptional results tomorrow, and next year, and next decade, we cannot continue to loose this high-energy top talent."

"As you can see, you've sent a lot of survey to me for all the jobs I have applied to (Intercompany Accountant, IT Auditor, Finance Analyst, General Accountant). Unfortunately, the Intercompany Accountant role was the only one processed (from phone interview to actual interview). Also, my application was sent through your referral program and it was only noticed when it was the Team Lead herself who e-mailed the HR to schedule an interview. I thought that it will be given more attention than the normal application process as it was your employee who referred me."
TODO ESTA BIEN
"Part of the documents that were required to be signed prior to the first day, or at least on it, were required again, in my case 3 times. So I had to fill several forms several times, like offer letter, CREDO, policies, registration form, etc. They said everything was delivered correctly by me to HR, but some of the documents didn't arrive to the right HR person and so were required again. I think the whole process was fast, very well communicated and fair, nothing to complain, so if there is something that can be improved, this is the documentation deliver process."
"Overall, I thought the process that Janssen took from a process perspective process was fair, efficient and thorough. I was impressed with the professional demeanor that was exhibited by everyone involved in the recruiting and interviewing process. Vikki Berger was one of the best recruiters I have ever worked with! "
"There is very little guidance for internal employees who are transferring to a new OpCo.  Do I have to hand my computer in at my current op co & get a new one when I reach my destination?  What about my ID badge?  Will Concur, my Amex card, and my Conference Call/Webex accounts automatically be updated?  There really should be a checklist that provides concrete details as to what the old manager, new manager, & transferring employee should do. What requests need to be completed?  That would have been helpful."
for changes inside the companies the recruiter should be more prepared on the contrct differences
The recruiting consultants could be more pro-active & timely with updates and f/ups.  
JNJ did the best that is possible and best that is available in market
Ser un poco mas comunicativo con el proceso
"Dear TA,  
My Offer Package included a Relocation information which was not the accurate one.  I received the Offer Letter on DEC 12th, and the error was identified during my conversation with the Relocation Consultant on JAN 10th.  Adjustments were made to amend the error, but the uncertainty of what to expect after the Package re-assessment was not desirable.  For future instances, TA needs to make sure that the information being provided is the latest and most accurate since critical career path decisions are made based on the information contained in the Offer Package.
Kind Regards,

"I really disliked the timed numeracy test. It doesn't affect real life situations and there simply wasn't enough time to compete the questions.  It made me feel terrible,  like I wasn't good enough even though I got offered the job! I don't think it is really appropriate to test doctors on these things as we all have a certain standard of education and not sure what a timed numeracy test adds really. "
everything ok
"i liked the process a lot, was fast and i always knew in what stage i was.
Thanks"
The delay in feedbacks on the selective process.
"J&J's recruitment process is slower than other companies, so faster turnaround can be an improvement. Other than that, everything else was very good. "
"The recruiter assigned to my position never reached out to me during the entire process...before, during or after.  I knew the hiring managers and all the communication went through them.  I didn't know the details of the comp plan until after I received the verbal offer...I had to then ask the hiring manager."
"The written offer should be send with the verbal one. It is really hard for us, candidates, to have faith in a proposal without any documents attached. And also, with the written one, we can discuss the benefits with the recruiter as we hear then explain to us. Without the written one is hard for us to discuss. "

"A faster update after the second interview (even if it's only to let you know it's still in process). I waited for over 2 weeks for an update on how my interview went (whether or not I was hired), even though I was told I would probably hear something within the same week."
enough
"I think the HR recruiter did not have all capabilities developed to discuss with me a manager position. The turn point on my process was the interview with the Director. At begging I thought about not continue in the process.
Other important point was the discution on my remuneration package. The HR recruiter did not want to consider taxes diferences on my remuneration what really made it hard to discuss it and be alligned with it. Some of the benefits she told me I would have was not exactly how I found it really was after been in the company"
Timely update of the application status.
I thoroughly enjoyed the process 
Recruitment was handled very well.  
"As an internal transfer, there wasn't much communication other than the offer letter package and confirmation of start date and if any information/activities were needed prior to or after transition.

More information catered to tranfers would be helpful"
"Treat internal candidates with respect aere external even if there's a closed loop of collegues involved in the process, communication and formailties should still be adheard to."
"Analyzing my recruitment, perhaps stating what are the strengths and weaknesses that have been detected."
I think the current process is very balanced with the appropriate amount of communication.
"This process was somewhat different, but was fair throughout. "
"I believe that receive the offer letter at the same day at the propousal is better. However, again, in my case, I truly believe in my Manager and did not doubt in any minute. "

"I have nothing to add in the recruitment process, it was very clear and met expectations."
"The interview process was clear and quick. But after receiving the approval, it took a long time to receive information. And some I received in the week I started. "
"At the time of my group dynamics we had a team composed of people who already work(ed) (on a temporary contract basis) at J & J and people who did not work at J & J; It generated an uncomfortable situation for both sides, since for those who already work(ed) in the company and knew much of the day-to-day functions demanded and had a business advantage and for those who did not work(ed) in the company.
For a fairer and healthier process it would be better to separate these two groups."
"It would be great if within the process we could get more details over the exact franchise and activities that we would be placed. The trainee programm was very well explained but the activities and the franchise the we would be working on were not explained during the interviews. Overall, the process was well conducted in spite of the point mentioned before."
NA
"- Make more positions available to those who have not been interns. We had about 80% of trainee positions being filled by former interns

It would be nice if it were a little bit faster
Throughout the process all very well placed points.
"The timing of the responses was too long, which caused many candidates to move on to another companies fearing that they would not be accepted at J&J. The room where we did our final interview was too small and hot, very unconfortable."
"Since I interviewed around Thanksgiving, and I'm aware things slow down at the end of the year, more feedback regarding when decisions would be made and communicated would have been helpful due to the holiday season. 

After the interview, I received no information until the end of January and had frankly assumed I didn't get the job. "
Written test needs to be conducted.
"Recruitment process was simple. Liza Cinco, my recuiter was very helpful in answering my questions and getting back to me promptly.She also apologized for the vetting process to be taking unusually long.

The only challenges I've experienced was with the vetting process. First, the Global Services contacted me directly requesting additional taxation information related to my two previous projects, the information that I thought they should have obtained after I completed my application. Second, I had to do my health questionnaire twice, once on-line and the second time on paper; it appears that Global Health Services did not obtain my questionnaire after I completed it thorugh the portal. They sent me a reminder letter a week later after I submitted it, which was rather annoying. And third, my manager did not receive clearance for me to start  on Monday until the prior Friday afternoon."
"Reduce the second-round exam environment in the process of recruitment, clear recruitment clerk's quality requirements."
I want recruiters to offer an opinion of the retired employee positively.
I understood there were only 2 candidates for the role so I feel the process could have been quicker than it was
"Process itself is clear and speedy, but no response after submitting the official letter or necessary materials. I am now waiting for the further update from you about first working day and its information how / what I need to do."
"The background check process provides no feedback.I spent over $100 to resolve a problem with my degree. Turned out there was a work around and I did not need to get a duplicate copy, so my money was wasted. If I received a response from the background team, I could have saved time, money and stress"
The recruitment process is well established.
"Make an activity diagram, which facilitates the management of time."
N/A
"The duration of the process was about 3 mos, from initial application to the offer. While that duration itself isn't bad, it was made slightly more difficult in that I was never sure when/if there would be a next step. The recruiters never confirmed officially if there would be additional interviews, etc. My recommendation would be to have a more open line of communication around when a position is expected to be filled, and how long before next steps occur. Other than that, my experience was a positive one!"
"Timely communication and 1- or 2-day deadlines for all involved, including hiring managers and 3rd party HR partners."
"For such a senior role, an assessment or a business case presentation might be required.

its preferred to have the communication between a candidate and the recruitment agency in the first stage only and the following phases to be through Talent Acquisition. This will facilitate the scheduling process more as well builds rapport with TA staff from inside Johnson & Johnson"
Improve contact and communication 
"johson & Johson could improve the recruitment process by doing the following steps:
-Improve comunication by giving updates or answering in a timely manner 
-Knowing the benefits that are offered for the position. In my case nobody knew exactly what was included
-Giving a complete written job offer  
-The selection process  put too much emphasis in the evaluation in a psicologist who make stadard test and with lack of professionalism"
"I had 8 interviews with different people, I found it excessive. It was not easy to find time in my current job to be able to attend all those interviews. But it did help that there was flexibility for the timings. Appreciate that from J&J."
Too have a fine tuning in recruitment process .
"In my case all was excellent, i think all it's ok."
Better not too long in process rekruitment
"For improvement could add psychology test to determine the nature, attitude and aptitude of applicants."
Nothing..
"I am generally satisfied with this recruitment process.
"
"Using previous compensation data from a different job function and inserting in to a formula to determine base salary was a negative, as opposed to developing an offer for the new position's responsibilities, and candidate skills and experience.
Additionally, if the same process is applied to future promotions, a domino effect is created with the initial compensation data used acting a ceiling on future compensation rather than compensation based on the value of the candidate in future roles."
It was a great process from start to finish. No improvement necessary at this point. 
"I think it is very good for recruitment process, just more for retained only."
Lack of communication was a major problem in the whole process.  There were long delays in receiving communication and very little explanation from recruiter regarding the next steps.  There was a lot of uncertainty regarding the offer and package.  I had to actively follow up to get any response.  The only thing that kept me going was my hiring manager's assurances.  The whole process was not well managed e.g. My global move letter arrived before the employment contract.  I had to request the relocation company to follow up on my offer letter.
Keep selling big picture of our One MD vision.

"It was one of the best processes I have gone through.  The whole thing from dealing with May in Singapore to Global Services in Manila, very straight forward and very easy to follow."
Hold the rotational program interview days slightly earlier in the fall. J&J was my last of 9 interviews but my top choice company which caused offer timeline misalignment. 
"The process needs more urgency. If I were to use two words to describe my experience they would be slow and linear. Everything has to be done in an extremely procedural and stepwise fashion. However there are surely some administrative steps that the prospective employee can complete, prior to the previous steps going through mill. This is especially true for roles that require 3rd party involvement in the recruitment process e.g. visa application. 

The delay between each of the steps in the process e.g. interviews to offer and offer to start date, is far too long. 

Starting a new job should be an exciting and high energy process. I've been through the talent acquisition process twice in the last year and each time have felt that my enthusiasm has been sapped by the process. I have also started to develop doubts as to whether I've made the correct career move both times. "
It could have been better to have an alignment with regard to BUHR approval and lateral transfer increase.
"Due to ESP in HR, a lot of things in the recruitment process are stalled and delayed.   Probably too much of compartments and hence people working in sylo, which resulted in too many stakeholders.   It is inevitable to streamline the recruitment process to be efficient. "
improve the automated emailings on available openings. I often receive posting notices that aren't related to the criteria I submitted or are substantially below my current level.
"Assignment and delivery of tools on first day, software/systems access ready: Access ID card, laptop, ipad, mobile phone, network account, email account, fixed telephone line configured. 

I spent one week without laptop and network account & email. I have seen other cases  close to my onboarding day when it takes from 1 up to 3 weeks to have all that ready. 

I believe we can improve user experience on first day of work to increase learning curve, have time to make initial and mandatory training, and definitely to improve productivity those days.

Thank you very much for the follow up you can give to improve. Regards."
"this was an internal position transfer, so likely not representative."

everything was explained in details during the process and i can not find anything to suggest to improve your process.
Make the process more faster 
"Generally, it was a very professional process, all the more so since it was conducted between several countries and also over the Christmas and New year period. That is also the reason why the written offer came more than a week after the first confirmation email - it was the holidays season."
Nothing especially from my side
"Information was provided on the benefits plan but it was not discussed, from what I can remember."
to have a better communication along the recruitment process and drastically shorten the time between verbal communication and written contract (it was appr. 2 months in my case).
"There was a lot of delay between the verbal offer and the offer letter itself, despite follow-ups by the hiring manager - I believe this can be improved a lot. I also think that the initial offer was not the best, so I needed to negotiate. These would be the two main improvement points, for the rest of the process it was pretty smooth for me and I think that Joanne did a really great job in explaining the position and recruiting candidates that fit the hiring manager's requirements. She was also a big help in the entire process and I appreciate that very much, just that I think she had a big volume to handle and that delayed some things. "
"I'm satisfied with the whole process and appreciate for the effort for me.
In my case, I know it's quirt rare case to relocate from KR to CN so TR manager should have spent more time than other cases to make proper offer not only to  pretect employee benefit but also to follow J&J CN policy.
I felt the most of caring as a J&J people.Appreciate again.   "

Faster recruitment process since the application.
"(+) Loved the structure of interview process - (received business cards - which is great for thank you emails, interviewer explained the process, and wrapped up with Q&As).

(-) Would like to see an improvement in the time between online application and interview process. "
"The interviewing process was as expected and feedback timely and on point.  The difficult part of the process was all the other stuff not mentioned in any of your questions thus far.  The access to encrypted emails, the amount of psychometric testing, the required documentation at each stage and the screening processes.  This was quite challenging for me.  I had finished up at my previous job and did not have access to computer, printer, scanning, etc. The timing was over the Christmas/New Year break which provided challenges around access to computer/printing services by which to provide timely responses to the process manager/HR contact."
I think the process is effective and fair
"In general, I felt comfortable with the recruitment process, however I consider it was little long, in some cases the period of time between some interviews was longer."
The process still takes pretty long to complete. Most of the time was waiting up front waiting to see if you were going to get an interview.
I don't believe that J&J's compensation model is fair to employees that are being promoted from within. 
"Better communication with new hires. After the recruiting/interviewing process, there seems to be a disconnect with knowing which role will be received and when the start date will be. I understand this is due to scheduling, however, not being kept in the know is quite stressful."
"Compared to other companies that were offering the same position, JnJ was way behind the boat. Other candidates were already committed to companies prior to JnJ even reaching out for interviews. I would like to help improve this process by attending the ASHP midyear meeting next year to interview potential candidates like the other companies do. "
Start the recruitment process early. 
A feedback to the prospective employee on the areas of improvement will help.
"I like to share that Luis, Anne and Luigi are extremely great recruiters. They are very accomodating to my requests. I view JnJ very favorably because of my interaction with these people. They are instrumental to my acceptance of the offer. They reflect the values that JnJ upholds in the Credo. Their team embodies what ideal recruiters should be. They should get a raise or something. They deserve it!"
"to make process quicker 
more time from HR to employees"
Not much. one of the most professional recruitment processes i have ever experienced.
"Provide written information on the meeting (position, meeting time, contact person,...). Verify with accuracy the profile of the candidate before plan the meeting. Anticipate the interview package to fill in."
continue always so!
Hand-off from Recruiter to Global Services wasn't clear.
"I was frustrated by the inability to counter offer.  It seemed as though I was offered the highest amount possible for the position which seemed odd to me.  In addition, the recruiter seemed confused at points about what had already been done with the hiring manager."
"More timely feedback, and shortened length from interview to offer.  My offer came more than 3 months after my initial interview."
have better follow through.
"I would like to commend Anne Niedo for always giving me updates in a very timely manner. She is very great as well as the whole team including Gianina and Luis. Will definitely recommend J&J to my friends.

"Internal hiring should be easier especially within the same company. I did not have clarity to timelines from the recruiter, it was all through my current contacts who also happened to be the ones interviewing me. I never got a response on if my performance bonus would carryover to new position. Recruiter did not seem informed of pay policies and commission structure of field sales."
Maybe somebody onsite
"The time between the verbal offer and the formal offer took more than 2 months. The process can be improved for sure, however, my hiring manager kept me in the loop throughout the process. "
"Raines International (external recruiter) went over and above to ensure that I had all the information I needed to make this important decision. 
Bruce and his team provided great insight about Johnson and Johnson.   They were extremely accessible and proactive throughout the process. 

Thank you. "
The recruiter should request and obtain feedback regarding the interviews and discuss the information with the candidate. This will help them to better prepare for the next stage of the interviews.
I never interacted with the recruiter when I went through this process. There was a lot of silence before the interviews were scheduled.
I wasn't completely aware that there would be one final live video interview following the assessment centre - I think it would be worth making this clearer to candidates next time. Other than that I had a great experience with the recruitment experience.
"First explain the benefits better, when you get the vivienida, to incorporate, and also keep track of how you feel the first few days."
I think that Johnson & Johnson careers webpage should be updated as the person is advancing in the selection process.
"I really liked the recruitment process. It was the most enjoyable i have done. I liked to do the Fit Challenge. It was way better then just an English and Logical Thinking test. 
But i believe the process should have ended sooner, so we would have more time to prepare the documents and make the admissional exam. "
This was an internal application. There was no formal recruitment process for me so this survey is not representative!!!
kick off more quickly
"No, thanks."
Recruiting process was clear and concise. Nothing to suggest at this time.
The process runs so far. I received feedback for each stage. 
Have a simpler process when it comes to converting a partner to an employee
"Even if  the company cannot tell the datailed next steps to candidates, I would say that the company is supposed to communicate with them more frequently to keep their mind still on the JnJ."
"Study the candidates better to determine whether they can fit in other positions. Let the offer owner to participate in various interviews, even outside his sector."
"The third party used for internal, international transfers is a bit lacking in simplicity and communication, but the AU JnJ recruiting team (in particular Jon Fallon), has done an extraordinary job in helping me stay informed and up to date on the submission of items to advance the stages in my transfer and my 457 Visa process. "
The process is great
I emailed some questions to HR but did not reccieve a response (i.e. regarding super annuation etc.) 
Good process...
"Nothing, I think that J&J has a excellent recruitment process.

Thank you for your time.

"Give more specifics about health insurance benefits for HMO plans. Be more mindful of your compensation when your potential candidates come from places that have better benefits, but less pay than you are offering.  Those benefits are important, and going them up requires additional compensation you are not taking into account.  Be mindful of the cost of living as well.  

But mostly, get better recruiters. Mine was rude, and gave a poor initial impression of the company.  She refused to give me information I needed to make an informed decision. She constantly pressured me to make a decision after months of waiting for an offer, as though she was doing me a favor of giving me an offer.   She acted as if I didn't have a right to question the offer, or give her explanations of why I thought the compensation was off.
If I had not been so impressed with the actual group I interviewed or if I did not already know someone in the company, I would not have accepted the offer, just based on her attitude.  The simplest questions were ignored, or answered in ways that didn't address the question.  It was a very frustrating experience. 

 The rest of the interview process was excellent and I did end up getting an offer that I thought was fair."
"i was in a unique situation going from a distributor rep to a company employee. i have not been happy with the lack of communication from Yale associates. i waited over a week after submitting by background info etc, received a message that it was incomplete and tried to get in touch with the individual who emailed me. he never has or did respond to me"
"nothing, it has been the best experience"
"As a general idea, recruiters need to keep open communication with candidates through the process. Internal processes take time and keeping candidates always informed is transparent and motivational."
"To let one Know when the process is delayed by an internal reason.

The last phase could be longer. Because few hours is not enough to the recruiter  knows everybody and maybe make a fair decision
the process for this job was seamless and fluid. many thanks to the interviewers and recruiter for a well executed process
Annette Bruno was FANTASTIC
"I was happy with the overall recruitment process even though I feel that the role was not specified enough in the job description. 

However, the recruiter explained the reasons why some things about the role might be unclear/information missing and I was asked if I was happy with that.

The recruiter communicated well throughout the whole process and provided regular updates on the next steps. Excellent communication from the recruiter side made this a very pleasant recruitment experience.  



I thought that three interviews were too much for the role to start off as I only "
I find recruitment process very fair and feel it could not be better than that.
Be transparent regarding the time between verbal and written offer - and indicate that now they are coming digitally only and require digital signatures.
Hire permanent full time recruiters rather than outsourcing to third parties.  Much more control and ease of communication.  Background approval process was difficult.
More communication/status along the way.  Speed up the process.
"More timely feedback of updates at each stage.
Understand what are the potential barriers to delays in recruitment, communicate and work with prospective employee to over come them"
"I never received feedback in relation to what aspects of my interview process the recruiter found made me an attractive candidate or what aspects they felt could make me a stronger candidate. I feel some form of a report indicating pros/cons of an interviewees performance would be of great benefit.

Thanks"
I understand that during my hiring process J&J was undergoing a new and different recruiting process and trying to internally get used to it. It was also unfortunate that my verbal timed perfectly with days off for Christmas and New Years which I assume added to the delay of me receiving my written offer. I will say it was confusing on who I needed to speak to and contact regarding questions about my offer or prerequisite processes moving forward for hire. There were multiple people involved. It would be a much more simple process if everything was reduced down to one person.

"Make sure all people involved understand their related tasks. The on-site personnel seemed quite confused about their part in it. I already worked as a temp filling in the position I applied for, so I was able to take care of most of the issues that came up. However, my supervisor didn't seem to know anything about transitioning or onboarding."
The offered position must match the candidate qualifications
Communication should come from the recruiter rather than the hiring manager/team members
"Shrink time for on boarding.  I applied in August, had my interview in September, was offered the position in December, but was not able to start until the end of January.  Overall the process was extremely long."
Streamline the process.  I interviewed in the beginning of January and wasn't offered the position until mid January.  No information is given.  Very unorganized.
no，
So far is a fair process and the recruiters are always available to answer any question through the process
"The initial contact was received 1-mo after applying for the job. There was a bit of a lag during the negotiation process from when the verbal offer and written offer was received. This was due to recruiter illness, the way the weekend fell, and response from the plant -- which was understandable. It was communicated at mid-day on the Wed before my start date that the drug test needed to be re-taken, requiring me to drive an hour to Cornelia so the company nurse could administer. Otherwise it was a comfortable process."
"Cannot think of anything that could have been done better, everyone was lovely and it almost didn't feel like an assessment. Top Marks!"
"I know people who did not received the negative feedback. I think this is really important and would be one more differential of JnJ. Furthermore, reforces our credo that says we must care of people."
"There is no transparency in the recruitment process and updates are extremely hard to get. 
When you finally get through to the people in HR they are rude and very sharp with their responses. There is no on site HR presence to go and talk to someone, the human element is totally lacking. On site in general there is a general feeling of discontent with the whole process and the lack of transparency. It gives people a bad impression of the site "
Reduce the time of each step of the process.
It needs to be clearer and even if it is internal recruitment a package needs to be presented as otherwise it is hard to see if the job is for you. Questions were met as an annoyance even as my question was valid as my full package was not put in the contract originally and simply swept aside. 
Very lengthy process. Offer was verbally made beginning of December and today I am still waiting for the paper offer. I received it through mail last week as every time there seems to be something wrong with the mail offer.
"J&J should look at the notice period as 3 moths is a very long time.
It may become a challenge if the people need to move on for higher or other roles outside the environment."
"I honestly had a wonderful experience! The process from video interviews to flying down to Florida was in the span of only a few weeks! We heard back very quickly, so I am happy to report a very positive process.

The only minor improvement I would recommend is retitling the email you send to arrange a call regarding the final results. The title of the email was ""Interview Feedback""  which I honestly thought meant I was not going to get an offer. I now this is a rather trivial point, but it is the only possible thing I think needs to change. Overall, this process was smooth and extremely positive1"
I was a Co-Op for 9 months last year and didn't have to go through recruitment much for my interviews and even the case study. Most of the process was taken care of while I was still at J&J. To improve the process after the offer is signed would simply be a clearer communication process. The requirements after signing the offer aren't straight forward especially if you are in my particular situation. I have contacted my recruiter with no response and a reinforcement that the process is going as planned would always help.
"It's interesting from this survey that the first question is that the recruiter explained the interview process.  The first contact I had was from the hiring manager to schedule an interview.  I do think it would have been great if someone from HR had contacted me to explain the process and what to expect and just to have a contact person throughout.

John, who contacted me initially with the verbal offer, was great.  He was constantly in touch with me, and gave me update.  If it wasn't for him giving me those updates, I would have taken another job.  My first contact regarding an offer was prior to Thanksgiving, but I did not receive a verbal offer until after Christmas.  I almost took another job during this time.  Once I got the verbal offer, I did get the written offer in 2 days (I do think I answered the question incorrectly about the timing between the verbal offer and written offer, but am not able to go back in this questionnaire).

Also after my second interview, I had not heard back until about a month later.  I thought that I didn't get the position, and so started to interview at other companies.  I had received 2 other offers prior to receiving J&J's verbal offer, so I do think it's important to make sure that the interviewee know what the timelines were.  If it had not been for a friend who had referred me, who was able to keep me in the loop, I think I would have gone to another company - because I didn't know where things stood.  So, I do think that the continual communication during the interview process would have been great.  I think once John got involved and he initially contacted me, he continued to provide me updates all throughout, which I really appreciated."
Have more responsive recruiters.  I called and emailed my recruiter repeatedly for over a month before getting a response.
I belive that the recruitment was very realistic with the activity to be carried out. 
Improve the time to give a feedback after interviews.
I understand we are going through transitions in HR proces but I feel that response time is not quick.. transfer date feb 1st but I am still waiting on information concerning some open questions since Jan 24
The process was excellent. No suggestion.
"The recruitment process could be better if it wouldn`t take many time. In my case it took 4 months.

"I still feel a little unsure about my exact role in the company but have been told that I will be put in touch with a current placement to get my questions answered; however, I am still waiting for this to happen."
Giving the feedback despite the results (positive or negative)
"The recruitment process could be improved by having greater knowledge in the local/regional Talent Acquisitions organizations with regard to the processes for posting, recruiting, selecting and offering global positions (as well as better partnerships established between regions).  There is an increasing move towards functional reporting lines where hiring managers are recruiting for positions in their organization outside of their home country and are relying on Talent Acquisitions to provide the guidance on the correct processes.  In my case (and several others that my new supervisor was recruiting for at the same time) there was a significant amount of confusion and led to nearly a month gap between the initial verbal offer of the position and the issuance of the written offer.

Also, I would suggest that Total Rewards look at the processes for providing fair and equitable compensation offers for the positions that are being recruited, particularly for internal J&J candidates.  There is no guidance in the offer recommendation worksheet of how to handle situations where the employee's current salary falls below the minimum salary amount of the new position's salary range and in my case I was offered a 12% increase which only landed me in a low single-digit percentile of the new range (nowhere close to the ORW suggestion that most offers for new positions should be within the 25th percentile and I will need to be in this role for over 7 years just to reach the 25th percentile).  Had I been an external candidate who was selected for the position (and not one who has chosen to remain a JNJ employee their entire career and only able to take incremental increases in salary with each promotion) my offer would have looked significantly different, which does not seem to be in the spirit of Our Credo."
Unfortunately December got in the way of the process and it slowed things down.

I was very pleased with the process and am delighted to have joined J&J!

"Include the hiring date at the offer letter is an area of opportunity.
Inform about some benefits bureacracy. Ex: time to receive corporate cell phone, car, etc."
"Just a feedback or follow up contact faster, but it is not a problem for the recruitment process, I think."
"About the internship recruitment process, I believe it took too much time from the moment we first apply to the moment we have the final answer - about 3 months.

From the interview to the final answer it was great (less than a week), but from the online step to the interview it took too long."
"The process took some time, but it was fair, taken the value of the offered function / job in to account."
As my experience with the interview process was well planned and dealt with in a very professional manor I would personally not have any reason to suggest reason for improvements .
"The one way video interview was unnerving and without the human interaction, was somewhat clinical. That said, it meant that it could be done at a time that suited us and we could prepare and relax ourselves before proceeding with it."
overall recruitment process should be not more than a month 
"Have a face to face interview. At no stage did i get to ask any questions about the role I'd be working in, what my responsibilities are, etc. I have been offered the position and twice have tried to make contact about questions I have and have been unsuccessful. The process is efficient but it removed any way of me getting to know more about the job other than the generic role responsibilities provided on the job advert."
"Shorten the feedback time and start the process earlier. My process was at the very end of the year, which conflicted with final exams / end of the term, making it hard to the candidates to complete the task/ provide documents needed."
Process could be more agile and faster.
"I was active in a position of ""acting director"" over the past year and applied now on my own role/FTE. This raised some questions and uncertainties at my end that could have been avoided with appropriate communication."
Thank you for the opportunity to improve my skills at the J&J!!!
"The time between verbal offer and the actual proposal took over a month! I actually, had to contact the recruiter to get things moving. That could have been smoother. However, the rest of the process went very smooth and in a timely manner."

"Be well prepared (e.g. know details on the job content, compensation package, next steps on recruitment process)
Clear and open communication on the details above.
Respect agreed timelines or communicate in case timelines cannot be followed."
"A condução do processo seletivo foi extremamente cuidadoso. O meu ponto focal em seleção, sempre atenciosa e preocupada em dar o maior número de informação sobre o andamento do processo, além de sempre propor alternativas para as várias entrevistas realizadas.
Entretanto, o processo de recebimento da job offer e o processo admissional com a documentação, detalhamento da integração foi mais moroso e com isso a sensação de falta de informações ou processo desacompanhado."
The follow-up was extremely slow and frustrating.  There would be silence for several days and sometimes more than a week would go by without hearing anything.  It is really crucial to speed up follow-up times throughout the recruitment process.  Offer package was low and below average.  Consider a more competitive offer package for the role comparable to industry standards.

Hold practical assessments for the final stage candidates to establish the best person for the role.
The automated online interview is a good idea for efficient use of resources but extending the available time to answer each question may allow each candidate  to answer each question comprehensively.

"I was extremely pleased and impressed with the recruitment process.  Erik Thor was extremely professional during the entire process.  Erik was always reachable for all my questions, and he provided timely updates along the entire process.  Eventhough I was going through this process at the end of the year during the holidays, everything proceeded smoothly thanks to Erik's help along the way.  The end result was that I accepted a position back in J&J and I am very happy now.  Since my experience was a success I would suggest that J&J continues what works and to get the feedback from Erik since he really is good at what he does!

I think the number of interviews is just fine.  What I think could be improved for a recruitment process is to consolidate the paperwork requests in just ONE because sometimes you receive requests for the same papers to be sent to different people and at different periods of time.  That would simplify the process
"Revisa melhor o perfil que o candidato busca, atualizando informações sobre ele.  Obrigado!!"
"I believe in a clear recruitment process, which the recruiter sets the beginning and end deadlines of a selection process to resume the appointment interview.

At no time did I receive feedback on this recruitment process and others that I have applied, and as a candidate, I feel disappointed."
I have no suggestion
"Feedback. And especially in senior management positions, such as my candidacy, to have personal contact with the candidate by senior professionals in the conduct of interviews, selection and everything else."
Johnson & Johnson is the best company that I have worked. So for me the recruitment process is perfect and correct.

"The recruiting process for j&j was long and applying took me certain preparation. I was excited about the possibility to work for such a great company, having in mind the goal of contributing to improve the health and lives of people around the world. Now that I am finishing my MBA, I finally had the opportunity to have an interview for the IRDP. Sadly, the recruiter told me that the program changed, and the company is only offering internships in my country. She just offered me an internship knowing that I was about to finish my MBA. 

The feelings I have are:
Why did the recruiting team took so long and waited until the interview to let me know about this change? (""We are no longer offering FT position in Chile where you applied, sorry, the IRDP changed since the last year). 

Why the recruiter didn't contacted the recruiter in EU to at least offer me a similar position in other geographical area? (i.e.: I have both Chilean and French passport and was applying to Chile but was not given the chance of a direct transfer to the EU recruiting process) 

How could I accept an internship position having an MBA and looking for FT positions? 

I really hope this feedback could help improving the recruiting process for such an inspiring and global company. All the best!

"Dear Talent Acquisition,

I have not received any rejection email in this case, however, when I checked the status of my application it indicated ""inactive"", which i assumed that the position has already been filled.  Considering that I am a microbiologist specialized in aseptic manufacturing, with over 20 years of experience, I assumed that I be a strong match if not perfect match, yet I have not received any phone interview. i wish I was receiving some feedback.

"Provide feed back to the prospective applicants. I was contacted by a gentleman by the name of Partridge, a corporate recruiter and participated in a phone interview with the hiring manager. Then never heard from anyone again for more than three months. The same recruiter contacted me and asked if I was still interested in the position. He then set up the face to face interview. At the close of the interview I was told that I would hear something within two weeks either from the hiring manager of from the recruiter. To date no one has either extended me an offer or provided feedback on the interview."
"After 5 months of no response or feedback from the recruiter, I withdrew my application.  First - give timely feedback to applicants.  If someone is not going to be given any real consideration for an opportunity - let them know and move on.  I would certainly rather be told I am not under consideration for a position then be left hanging for 5 months.  I might not expect feedback if I were an external candidate - but since I work at JnJ and believe in the Credo - I think internal candidates deserve some feedback, even if it is only an automated email from the recruiter."

"1. Clear and honest communication.
2. Respond to inquiries in a timely manner.
3. Ensure you are hiring competent recruiters 
4. Do not send out incorrect information to applicants (I received multiple emails saying I withdrew from the positions I bid on and that was not true in any of the cases, I actually accepted a position that I was told I withdrew from)
5. Actually consider employee referrals (I referred someone for multiple positions and checking the system, it said he went through all the steps and was even interviewed but not hired.  In truth he never heard from recruiting and when I questioned the process, no one responded)

Finally, I love working for J&J, have been with the organization for 18 years, but I strongly believe recruiting does not reflect how wonderful this Company can be to work for."

Communciation! Often it is months before you hear from any one. 
"The process could be improved with better communication to prospective candidates. The process was not explained and once an offer was made and discussed and told that it would be discussed with the team, I never heard back from the recruiter. I think this was very unprofessional, considering they wanted to offer me the role and I followed up with no response. Ultimately, the recruitment process reflected badly on this entire process. The interviewers explained the role well and communicated well. The gating factor was the recruiter - and lack of communication and follow up on her part. It was disappointing as I have worked with other recruiters in the Bay Area and not had this same experience. "

Improve the application process. I did not withdraw my application and it's showing that I withdrew thats very negative candidate experience. 
At least do a phone interview before writing somebody off for a position.
Provide status updates.  I applied to this position in November 2016 and never heard back after posting and also following up with the hiring management.  
5 months with no feedback at all will discourage candidates that have desirable qualities as they will probably have other opportunities.  Some contact to at least update the status of the position would be helpful and encouraging.

The reason I stated above that the interview process highly affected my rating of the company in general is because the hiring team (HR and hiring manager [Christine]) were so very understanding of my decision.

Good process from what I have seen so far.  Thanks for not asking for too many details until we are in agreement that the job posting is a good fit for my skill set.  
Follow through
It would be good to loop back about the role when the recruiter said (s)he was to follow up if the position is still active.
More notification of status changes to help the prospective employee stay up to date on what is going on.
"Dear Sjoerde,

the perfect match for me (for us) was ""WW director supply chain quality"". What's the point going forward then?

Invite for interview, have a better understanding us both of the mutual potential and possibly treat people as people and not as e-machines or free survey-takers. Delivery and values of individuals on e-skills comes later not before the selection.

Cheers, Alessandro"
The email alert to an open position is not always generated even though I have specific preferences selected under my job profile.

"Job position was a good match with my previous proven work experience, but I changed my mind on working during 3rd shift (since I want to spend time with family). I asked J&J team to consider me for 1st or 2nd shifts if new openings are available.

I recommend that recruiter continues to call ""good"" match candidates since live conversation will quickly identify proven experiences. Before, there was a clear disconnect on previous job applications, but I feel this last experience resolved the issue. I hope that I will get updates on the other applications (still pending), but no updates yet."

Jonhnson & Johnson should choose interviewers wisely and prepare them better.  The Admin had many errors multiple times on the interview schedule.

"J&J is one of the best places to work, great people too."
"I applied November 3, 2016 and had not heard anyting about the recruitment status of this position since then.  This survey (2/27/17) is the first response I have recieved.  In the interim I decided to withdraw my applicaiton assuming that the position was already filled and focus on developing within my current role in the company while still lookng for other opportunities for growth in company.  It would be helpful if the status of recruitment was provided on a more timely basis."
Not pick and choose - Current administration needs to look at J and J practices. 
An employee should hear back if they are not selected for the interview within a specific time frame.
"Show the status of the applications, such as filed, under review, shortlisted, etc."
"I did not receive any correspondence related to this position, so unaware of anything related to this position."
"Only issue I have is with the background check, There is no feedback as the process develops and there is no response to questions. We had an issue with my degree and I ended up getting a duplicate copy that was not needed. This cost me $200 and some stress that could have been easily avoided if my questions had been responded to."
"I am in a different position than the normal run of the mill employee, because I want to relocate from South Africa to a safer country. So in terms of assisting employees who want to relocate with providing information on jobs in various countries, I think the intranet options could be made be a little easier. It is very confusing to try and set up new job listing alerts."
"I hear and my experience also says that you can move around within a company only if you have recommendation.  Without network and recommendation, it is almost impossible to move to another area.  I don't think HR plays any strong role in selecting or recommending candidates."
Do more promoting from within; job descriptions should encourage those without exact-matching experience to be consider for roles.  The job descriptions are too exacting and written as if there is a particular person already in mind to fill the role.
A racist company who ick and choose candidates based on age and origin. terrible racist recruiters who do as they please. 
"For starters, if the hiring manager calls a candidate  because they are interested in them, then he/she should put forth an effort to actually make contact with the candidate. Even if the message is to tell the candidate that the company has ""gone in another direction."""
Better follow up 
Hire not racist people who do not pick and choose and are polite 
"Improve by communicating with applicants in a more timely manner.  I withdrew my applications, despite being convinced in my qualifications, due to my impression that my candidacy was not being pursued - much to my disappointment."
"Improve by communicating with applicants in a more timely manner.  I withdrew my applications, despite being convinced in my qualifications, due to my impression that my candidacy was not being pursued - much to my disappointment."
To me the process was smooth and do not see any issue.
Reduce the cycle time for responding to candidates and even finalist in the process and perhaps provide a visual aid of where they are int he process.
"This position was listed as the Iowa-Illinois manager position, and the job posting stated the employee must live in the either Iowa or Illinois.  The hiring manager vehemently insisted the manager live in Chicago.  Ironically, he does not live in the Region he manages.  Even though I felt I was a strong capable candidate for the position, living in Chicago would not meet the needs of my family, and so I withdrew my candidacy.

"
"Follow through, and ensure recruiters are fully informed about positions and candidates."
"Communication is key.  There is a serious lack of communication with potential employees.  I received one email, the one I received after applying. For several months I heard nothing.  It was frustrating not knowing where I stood during the whole process. "
"The J&J recruiter was not involved in the process.  My first interaction with the ""process"" was with the dept admin who set up interviews."
I found out via my department updates that I did not get this job - no one contacted me to tell me that I was no longer being considered as a candidate. This really impacted my view/relationships with my former team.
start to finish was a very long process.
"I never heard back from this posting. I bid in December and never heard back from anyone. In the meantime, I interviewed for another job and got the position. I assuming that terminated by bid officially?"
The process is good.
"follow up , be fair and do not pick and choose and do nor practice favoritism"
Be fair and do not pick and choose 
It would be helpful for Johnson & Johnson to give internal candidates an opportunity to advance to different positions within the company. 
"Give JnJ employees the benefit of the doubt

"The communication channels between recruiter and candidate could be improved. Immediately after the recruiter confirms that he/she is not interested in the prospective candidate, for whatever reason, they should make the candidate aware of that immediately. I found myself waiting for answers frequently in the recruiting process.  "
"I thought that for the position I applied for (Sr. Administrative Assistant) that 7 interviews were a bit much.  I know I'm supporting the entire team, but 3-4 interviews with the top team members would have been sufficient."
Make it less intensive. Offer full time to your co-ops. 
Yes.

Please note I applied for another position in J&J which is a better fit for my experience. 
Response regarding the interview even if I was not the right candidate should have been communicated. I had other offer later on so of course I withdrew from consideration. 
Feedback is key as well as following up on communication promises.

What can Johnson & Johnson do to improve the recruitment process?
Nothing. The process is very good and fair. I was just applying wrong time. (just before Christmas holidays.)  
"I did not withdraw my application.  By receiving this email, this show that J&J recruitment process need further improvement.  Suggest to review the application process to find more flaws or understand why this can happen.  Thanks and again, I still think J&J is a good company to work with."
"Clarity in job description and salery suggestions to avoid such situation.
Recruitment agent should not withdraw for applicant the way it happened.
If second application for a different role is pending this should not be disregarded and just withdrawn by somebody else.
Thank you for considering these points.
...I am currently no longer looking for a job"
process is good 
"Provide timely feedback to the applicant and to the hiring managers. With our new hire now, we (the ones hiring) are asking each other if HR has gotten back to any of us regarding the hiring status."

Send feedback.
Send the interview result to the candidate whatever he or she has passed the interview. That shows respect andy sweetness.
Strange to have psychometric testing as final strange of recruitment process 
"A follow up phone call would have been good - the HR manager did call but was retiring the next day and I was told someone else would be following up. Position I applied for apparently wasn't available when I interviewed but from my understanding they were seeing if I was suitable for the other role I was not interested in. In any case, a follow up call would have been good - last thing I heard was ""they would be in touch"" which has never occurred "
I have been in this organization for a while and I feel the recruiting team is not that connected to employees as they used to be.  
This role was my perfect role - inventory / consignment with SAP - but I couldn't afford to drop my pay by such a large amount - over10k - I just thought for this role with my experience with Medtronic - but I found the talent team contact Rickke very easy and approachable - thank you

"Please inform candidates about the application status. Infact I applied for a supply chain director position in Dubai last year and even now its status is shown as ""active, still accepting job submissions"". I have no idea whether my application is considered or the position itself is on hold or filled up.

Some times J&J local HR departments does not really care, they have other ways to fill the positions."
"It seems sometimes the position is posted becuase it has to be posted although the candidate is pre-determined. Also, I applied for a couple of other positions, but I've never got any feedback, even pass or fail.  Of couse I assumed I failed if I didn't hear the result for more than a month. "

"I wasn't told specifically which brand I will manage even if I have signed the contract with J&J.

"Explain the recruitment process before the candidate starts into the process, j&j was very quick to reply to the initial application. First contact was excellent and very much like a job interview, second interview was also good, however I was thinking that that was going to be THE interview only to find out that there would be another interview then isometric testing, this is a long process and timing is important when taking on a new job, people don't want to have to wait along time to hear back about a job, if you have to wait life moves on and you lose the opportunity or the person makes another decision. Also I was told I would hear back by the end of the week and I didn't. Follow up is crucial. All the best."

"The recruiter was very fair and friendly but the Interviewer seemed unprepared and dort of unfriendly and not willing to listen to the statements given by anyone else. 

The second Time applying was totally different (A+ recruiting process). So this dependet fully on the interviewer of the Business Unit. "
"Hi,

thank you to ginve me the opportunity to respond to this Survey, I applied several times for several positions fitting my expectation and my job profile, nevertherless I received one phone call for a screening interview (30 min) with the HR department representative in France for one specific position - on 13 DEC 16, then on 2nd Feb 2017 I received an email from the J&J HR to apologies about the delay.
the negative point resides with the timelines, but the positive point, I received an email from the business manager responsible for this position, explaining the delay
Hope that's clarify

Kind regards

Mourad"
Be clearer on structure of TA organisation early on in the process. Otherwise the process was excellent.
Nothing. It's the right way
I would have appreciated to know or receive some info within a week about my perspectives after I was interviewed. 
Shouldn't have to go through this procedure all over again if you move to a sister company of J&J .
Everything is fine. Thank you.
"At the moment, I think that J&J does not have to improve the recruitment process."
"First of all I was very disappointed to not get even a respond on my requests after 4 months of application process.

In my opinion a transparent and clear application process would have a great value. 

To not be able to get information (over a period of time of 4 months) from the responsible HR Support and just beeing several times ignored,even as a intern applicant, was very disappointing to me."
"Give some feedback!!!!, this is the first communication i have had since spending the time filling in my application form after being given details of the role by a recruitment consultant. 

I heard nothing from the consultant or even yourselves since this ""survey"" request came through, so to be fair I don't really think much of your recruitment process as the communication  was terrible. 

Would i want to work for an organisation who communicated with candidates as poorly as you did? Maybe not, either way i recommend you up your game in terms of communication to candidates and maybe replace your recruitment consultant who is obviously just gathering CV's for you without a care for the candidates forwarded to you. 

|You asked for feedback, i hope this helps. "
Explain at least in General the functional responsibility in the department up to director and top down strategic goals maybe the candidate can identify with his role and responsibility.
Continue to count on the excellent team of recruiters you currently have.
"The recruitment process is slow but that's not the main problem. There is no deadline communicated so I spent weeks waiting for the next interview to be planned. I didn't have any person to contact to have more information. 
The process could be better if the candidates have a better vision of the next steps and someone to contact to have information. "
When advertising roles please include salary scale as this would have ensured that I would not have made the application and wasted everyone's time
I would had appreciated a videocall interview instead of telephone call.
Treat ex employees differently to complete new applicants and give more than a week notice to travel over 400 miles. Consider Skype interviews etc etc - as above
".I think the recruitment process at this time is very good . The answers about the next  steps can be faster , but I know it is not possible at every time."
Nothing it was a comprehensive and fair process
Provide faster feedback between recruitment steps.
"The process was fantastic Claire was quickly in contact and explained the role in more depth to me.

Sadly this role did not reach my salary expectations but I would be very keen to discuss any further opportunities in the future."
"Provide feedback on interviews and selection process in a timely fashion, especially for those who are current employees.  Zero feedback was received for this application, not sure how this is acceptable. Johnson and Johnson has the worst recruitment process and practice that I've experienced."
"I have been trying to get a Johnson and Johnson interview since 2013 and have been impossible to get one, I have been studing , learning and getting more knowledge about how to get into your company, never you contact with me, I have applyed more than 100 possitions and any response, as you can see I really want to work in your company but is very difficult, also I sent an e-mail to Human Resource in 2015 asking about if  something was wrong abou my profile but no one asnwered me. / I am sure that you have some kind of problem on  your recruitment process. / If you want futher information please contact with me / Best regard / Iñaki rivas"

Process is very good.
be clearer in the type of contract offered
"What I did not appreciate is the fact that talent acquisition was very definitive around certain aspects, which after having a conversation with the hiring manager appeared to be very different. Aside that, talent acquisition apparently did not take the time to read the accompanying message nor the resume attached. "
"The interviewer must make sure that the profile of the candidate closely matches the the requirements of the job.  In my case, the interviewer was abrupt in telling me that ""the job is that of a Lead and not a Manager, and we can't match your salary expectation"". And was in such a hurry to drop the phone. Really a shocking and appalling experience!"
More communication.
"For me as a former employee J&J is still a great company. As always impressions are dependant from who is sitting in certain positions and making decisions. Here I think J&J should think about what reputation the company wants to build in the market and probably put more emphasis on their managers to ensure a professional hiring process. My impression was influenced in a very negative way during the process which was the main reason for my withdrawal. Not only the future employee but also the company needs to convince the candidate. In terms of communication, timing, reliable information etc. this process was a mess and my impression was that J&J thinks they can do whatever they want because everyone wnats to work for them anyway. This is an arrogant attitude which was enhanced during the process by e.g. having different people in the interviews than announced, having short term time changes the evening before the final business case, interviewers being late (more than 40min!) due to internal miscommunication etc. and the leadership team being unable to make a final decision (positive or negative) for a sales rep position after 5 months and at least three official conversations/interviews. For me this is not how a professional hiring process looks like and is not how I want my future employer to present himself. If you demand high performance and outstanding mindset you should do your homework and present yourself in that way rather than as explained above."
You should conduct personal interviews before dismissing candidates with the required qualification
"Communicate more with the candidate - 2 weeks without any follow up after the process having being completed is too long.  
Ensure all stakeholders are aligned prior to the recruitment process beginning. Treat the candidate with respect, respond and wrap up in the interview process appropriately. "
"Communication is absolutely key. Keep candidates informed along the way at all stages, it really erodes the J&J brand with internal and external candidates when applications just get lost with no communication"
Improve the website 
"As a board member my agenda has hardly free spaces during the day. When J&J wants to meet this level of candidates, a slot very early or at the end of the working day is easier to schedule. Secondly, 4 days notice before a fixed slot is for a board member not feasible. The recruiter did an excellent job, the hiring manager did not show any flexibility. Hopefully J&J learn from this."
"I think there is miscommunication about this position, as since my application I did not receive any new information.
I realized that the position was posted long time ago, therefore I can imagine that it was already fulfilled or cancelled, but I would appreciate receiving any insight about that.
Diogo"
It was great! 
"Feedback on the timescales.
Feedback if you are not successful from HR and from the recruiting manager.

"I did not withdraw from the position ""Manager Center of Excellence"" - how could it happen?"
"I applied for two roles at the same time. One via an agency and a different role directly. By chance, I received invitations to apply for both roles within an hour of each other.

I declined the agency contracting role and despite email correspondence directly from JnJ, I never heard from you again. I would love to work with JnJ but am bitterly disappointed that despite emails, a strong CV and an abundance of skills and experience you feel I have somehow tried to deceive you. 

I was offered a role from you, have previously worked for you and was offers an interview for a senior role. Perhaps we can find a way forward!
"
More information by mail 
"I only worked with the hiring manager and his admin during the early stages of the process.  The recruiter did not get involved until an offer was ready to made.  In hindsight discussions with the recruiter, I think this is because the original posting was in the UK and extended to US, so the process was being managed by the UK Admin.  I think the process would be clearer if it was harmonized across the global"

"On this occasion, I was very disappointed with the recruitment process.

HR must improve how they manage internal applications. When the candidate applies to a position, it's assumed that already being a J&J employee you would have a closer interaction with HR and have greater visibility on the application status.  

Despite having contacted the HR recruiter several times to ask about the role and application status, I was never followed-up on and was never confirmed if I was still being considered for the role, until the request for this survey came through. 

I believe internal candidates should receive the same (or even more) attention and consideration as external ones do. Caring for our employees is a big part of the CREDO, therefore I hope to see some improvement in the internal recruitment in the near future.

"Be more up front about the opportunities, or lack thereof, in the job description."

I did NOT withdraw my application.

My application was several months ago and not even a confirmation of whether or not my application would be progressed was given.

The next communication received from J&J is this, asking me to complete a survey, asking why I ""withdrew"" from the application, which is untrue.

J&J was recommended to me by my cousin who is a Director at J&J in Toronto Canada. Must confess that I am disappointed with the lack of communication, I would have expected a more professional approach from such a reputable organisation.
